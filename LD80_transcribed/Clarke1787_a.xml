<p>I. IT generally afford&#8747; &#8747;ome degree of amu&#8747;ement, to tho&#8747;e who po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747; an exten&#8747;ive acquaintance with general hi&#8747;tory, to ob&#8747;erve the minute cau&#8747;e&#8747; from whence important event&#8747; have &#8747;o often derived their origin. For if trifle&#8747; often affe&#392;t the mind&#8747; of the greate&#8747;t men, and of the greate&#8747;t multitude&#8747;; the fir&#8747;t by their &#8747;ituation, and the latter by their bulk, occa&#8747;ion tho&#8747;e affair&#8747; in the world which we chara&#392;terize by the name of Important; whil&#8747;t, in the greatne&#8747;&#8747; of their effe&#392;t&#8747;, their in&#8747;ignificant original cau&#8747;e&#8747; are generally forgotten. Yet every inve&#8747;tigating faculty of the human mind i&#8747; intere&#8747;ted, when an opportunity offer&#8747; of deducing, by a dire&#392;t channel, large and exten&#8747;ive con&#8747;equent&#8747;, from a combination of circum&#8747;tance&#8747;, either overlooked becau&#8747;e they are common, or &#8747;lighted becau&#8747;e they are trivial; but &#8747;uch a&#8747;, when united and urged in a particular dire&#392;tion, thru&#8747;t them&#8747;elve&#8747; abroad into the world, and become of con&#8747;equence to mankind: even when no &#8747;uch dire&#392;t channel of inquiry offer&#8747; it&#8747;elf, we are apt enough to be plea&#8747;ed, if, by compari&#8747;on and analogy, we can draw &#8747;uch inference&#8747; a&#8747; Curio&#8747;ity at lea&#8747;t may warrant, and Rea&#8747;on not di&#8747;avow.</p>
<p>II. When we wi&#8747;h for the leading part&#8747; of a di&#8747;tingui&#8747;hed chara&#392;ter, we recur to private anecdote&#8747; of the life to which it belong&#8747;; are fond of tracing the conne&#392;tion between the&#8747;e and it&#8747; more noted exploit&#8747;, and fancy we &#8747;ee &#8747;ome uniform motive &#8747;till exerting it&#8747;elf, though in different quarter&#8747;, and on a diver&#8747;ity of obje&#392;t&#8747;; proportioning it&#8747; power&#8747; to the nature or magnitude of it&#8747; toil, and only varying a&#8747; it&#8747; employment&#8747; vary. The &#8747;ame wi&#8747;h operate&#8747; with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to nation&#8747; at large: we aim at their leading motive&#8747;, and find it ea&#8747;y to call &#8747;uch or &#8747;uch an a&#392;tion the natural re&#8747;ult of &#8747;uch an humour, or &#8747;uch a prejudice.</p>
<p>III. To &#8747;ay po&#8747;itively for what particular rea&#8747;on the people of different countrie&#8747; have adopted thi&#8747; or that cu&#8747;tom, will alway&#8747; be beyond the reach of the keene&#8747;t &#8747;peculation. &#8747;ome, it i&#8747; likely, nature hath originally given to all; other&#8747;, climate and circum&#8747;tance&#8747; may have engrafted: but the greate&#8747;t part mu&#8747;t be referred to that complex and ob&#8747;cure variety of intervening cau&#8747;e&#8747;, to which, becau&#8747;e we cannot develope their particular relation, nor trace them through their intricate maze&#8747;, we have affixed the general epithet of Chance. The&#8747;e again, in a &#8747;ort of permutation, have produced an infinite number of di&#8747;tin&#392;tion&#8747;, of which local hi&#8747;tory can only take in a part at a time: however, in every country &#8747;ome particular thing&#8747; may be found, which on compari&#8747;on appear &#8747;imilar to tho&#8747;e of another; yet are of &#8747;uch a kind, that they cannot ea&#8747;ily be attributed to nature or climate alone, but bear the mark&#8747; of a commerce and interchange, that ha&#8747; &#8747;ome time &#8747;ub&#8747;i&#8747;ted, either dire&#392;tly, or by the mediation of other&#8747;. If " I will throw a &#8747;tone upon your cairn," wa&#8747; an expre&#8747;&#8747;ion of friend&#8747;hip among&#8747;t our forefather&#8747;, we, of cour&#8747;e, refer it to their &#8747;cythian ance&#8747;tor&#8747;; yet the&#8747;e tumuli, which we call Cairn&#8747; and Barrow&#8747;, are found to have been in old time&#8747; among&#8747;t the Hebrew&#8747;, Greek&#8747;, and Roman&#8747;; and indeed what el&#8747;e are the Egyptian pyramid&#8747;? But who would have thought that the&#8747;e &#8747;ame cairn&#8747; or barrow&#8747;, and thi&#8747; &#8747;ame cu&#8747;tom, &#8747;hould have exi&#8747;ted beyond the utmo&#8747;t ea&#8747;tern limit&#8747; of A&#8747;ia, in the barren i&#8747;land of Oonala&#8747;hka? Again: The cri&#8747;ping, perfuming, and powdering of hair, are thing&#8747; which have been in former age&#8747; a&#8747; well a&#8747; thi&#8747;; yet one rather &#8747;tartle&#8747; at hearing that they are common to unknown &#8747;avage&#8747; on the oppo&#8747;ite &#8747;ide of the world, and beyond the &#8747;outhern tropic. Painting &#8747;eem&#8747;, by all wild nation&#8747;, to have been fir&#8747;t applied to their own bodie&#8747;; and it i&#8747; hard to determine, that the cu&#8747;tom ha&#8747; not crept down, through all the different &#8747;tage&#8747; of civilization, from tho&#8747;e time&#8747; to our own. That the component part&#8747; of dead bodie&#8747; &#8747;hould be united at a certain period, and become immortal, wa&#8747; a tenet among&#8747;t the Greek&#8747;, a&#8747; well a&#8747; among&#8747;t Jew&#8747; and Chri&#8747;tian&#8747;. The belief of a chao&#8747;, of a rebellion in Heaven, of a general deluge, and of &#8747;everal other thing&#8747;, have been common to religion&#8747; va&#8747;tly remote from each other. There i&#8747; a &#8747;trong re&#8747;emblance between
<pb n="vi"/>
the &#8747;torie&#8747; of Jo&#8747;eph and Bellerophon, of Jeptha and Idomeneu&#8747;. The funeral howl ha&#8747; been rai&#8747;ed in almo&#8747;t every quarter of the earth, and human &#8747;uper&#8747;&#8747;tition ha&#8747; alway&#8747; had it&#8747; fau&#8747;ti and nefau&#8747;ti die&#8747;. Many Engli&#8747;h word&#8747;, with their native meaning attached to them, have migrated into Calabria and Apulia; yet we know not whether they were introduced along with Engli&#8747;h &#8747;heep, or at &#8747;ome other time. The&#8747;e thing&#8747;, without doubt, and many more that might be in&#8747;tanced, originate from cau&#8747;e&#8747; which have not been of &#8747;ufficient importance for the notice of general hi&#8747;tory; or they have crept on in a &#8747;ilent progre&#8747;&#8747;ion; or have been tran&#8747;ported by ca&#8747;ualtie&#8747;, the authentic &#8747;tory of which i&#8747; either lo&#8747;t or ob&#8747;cured by time: yet &#8747;ome of them furni&#8747;h powerful argument&#8747; for the exi&#8747;tence of ob&#8747;olete arrangement&#8747;, and unrecorded intercour&#8747;e. It i&#8747; here that local attempt&#8747; to &#8747;upply the void in general hi&#8747;tory take place, and pre&#8747;ent re&#8747;emblance&#8747;, which may &#8747;timulate curio&#8747;ity to inve&#8747;tigate, if po&#8747;&#8747;ible, their cau&#8747;e&#8747;.</p>
<p>IV. That language&#8747; radically the &#8747;ame, even in the latter age&#8747; of the world, &#8747;hould a&#8747;&#8747;ume altered tone&#8747; and idiom&#8747;, far alienated from their original one&#8747;, doe&#8747; not &#8747;eem wonderful, when one recolle&#392;t&#8747; the number of promi&#8747;cuou&#8747; tongue&#8747; with which force and other contingencie&#8747; have blended them; it &#8747;eem&#8747; to me rather more wonderful, that modern refinement, and the laboured improvement&#8747; of grammarian&#8747;, have not almo&#8747;t erazed every trace of affinity. A language, when once &#8747;ettled with cla&#8747;&#8747;ic preci&#8747;ion, will of cour&#8747;e leave out &#8747;uch a number of the current phra&#8747;e&#8747;, and word&#8747; of particular di&#8747;tri&#392;t&#8747;, a&#8747; are proportional to the difference between the diale&#392;t&#8747; of tho&#8747;e di&#8747;tri&#392;t&#8747; and of the men who compiled the &#8747;tandard tongue: &#8747;ome, be&#8747;ide&#8747;, will be lo&#8747;t by forgetfulne&#8747;&#8747;, and other&#8747; overlooked on account of their vulgarity. In proce&#8747;&#8747; of time the&#8747;e excluded word&#8747; and phra&#8747;e&#8747; grow more and more e&#8747;tranged, become at la&#8747;t a barbari&#8747;m, and are forgotten. Yet it i&#8747; not perhap&#8747; unworthy of a thinking mind to ob&#8747;erve, how other tongue&#8747; of the &#8747;ame &#8747;tock &#8747;till retain, in their pure&#8747;t &#8747;tate, many of tho&#8747;e thing&#8747; which are exiled into the more barbarou&#8747; and remote diale&#392;t&#8747; of another; or in what manner expre&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747;, though occa&#8747;ionally changed in termination, <i>&#38;c.</i> mingle familiarly with the current of one mode of &#8747;peech, when they have lo&#8747;t all conne&#392;tion with each other. There are few diale&#392;t&#8747; which have not &#8747;omething di&#8747;tin&#392;t and peculiar to them&#8747;elve&#8747;; either in &#8747;ingle word&#8747;, particular phra&#8747;e&#8747;, or the general &#8747;tructure of their &#8747;entence&#8747;; and when &#8747;uch a diale&#392;t a&#8747; one of the&#8747;e ha&#8747; no &#8747;tandard of it&#8747; own, that i&#8747;, before civilization and learning have given it uniformity, every one that write&#8747; will write the word&#8747; he i&#8747; accu&#8747;tomed to, and in the &#8747;tile which u&#8747;e ha&#8747; taught him. Again: Where there i&#8747; no great &#8747;eminary to produce &#8747;cholar&#8747;, who may dignify and fix their native idiom by their writing&#8747;; an idiom, formed on &#8747;ome more fa&#8747;hionable plan&#8747;, and e&#8747;tabli&#8747;hed by &#8747;ome eminent performance&#8747;, will be &#8747;ought; it will become the language of &#8747;cholar&#8747;, and learning in time mu&#8747;t not deviate from it. Yet a&#8747; every county in England, though the radical&#8747; of it&#8747; language be common, and it&#8747; &#8747;peech in general conformable to that of the re&#8747;t, u&#8747;e&#8747; many phra&#8747;e&#8747; notwith&#8747;tanding which are peculiar to it&#8747;elf; we may naturally infer, from the variety of nation&#8747; who have inhabited thi&#8747; i&#8747;land, that it wa&#8747; alway&#8747; &#8747;o; and that the &#8747;tandard tongue, which i&#8747; a &#8747;ort of mixture of the whole, left out many word&#8747; a&#8747; needle&#8747;&#8747;, becau&#8747;e &#8747;upplied by other diale&#392;t&#8747;, and reje&#392;ted many more on account of their vulgarity. Therefore, if any particular place ha&#8747;, by it&#8747; cultivation of letter&#8747;, or by it&#8747; authority, e&#8747;tabli&#8747;hed the &#8747;uperiority of it&#8747; own diale&#392;t; that diale&#392;t, a&#8747; it advance&#8747; in refinement, will gradually become fa&#8747;tidiou&#8747;, and reje&#392;t or forget many of it&#8747; own homely phra&#8747;e&#8747; which it had in common with other&#8747; of the &#8747;ame &#8747;tock, and a&#8747;&#8747;ume tho&#8747;e of language&#8747; which circum&#8747;tance&#8747; have rendered &#8747;till more learned or fa&#8747;hionable. Few will he&#8747;itate in calling thi&#8747; an emendation; yet &#8747;uch emendation will make the di&#8747;tin&#392;tion &#8747;till more obviou&#8747;, a&#8747; it mu&#8747;t of cour&#8747;e leave out many of tho&#8747;e expre&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747; which it once u&#8747;ed in common with it&#8747; kindred diale&#392;t&#8747;, and which ru&#8747;ticity and &#8747;olitude have in the mean time &#8747;ecured from any material alteration: for from whatever cau&#8747;e language&#8747; originate, without book&#8747; a&#8747; a fixed point to which they may recur, they will alway&#8747; in general intercour&#8747;e be vague and flu&#392;tuating.</p>
<p>V. That irregular, but mi&#8747;chievou&#8747; kind of war, which i&#8747; called Incur&#8747;ive, cannot
<pb n="vii"/>
well &#8747;ub&#8747;i&#8747;t but among&#8747;t tho&#8747;e who re&#8747;ide in territorie&#8747; contiguou&#8747; to the boundarie&#8747; of two ho&#8747;tile or rival &#8747;tate&#8747;. It&#8747; requi&#8747;ite i&#8747; Expedition, and it&#8747; obje&#392;t Plunder. The di&#8747;turbance of war&#8747;, like the boiling of a caldron, hath a &#8747;ort of &#8747;cum. Trouble&#8747;ome temper&#8747;, incapable of re&#8747;t, and fond of rapine through native avarice or inveterate habit&#8747;; the&#8747;e temper&#8747;, when jealou&#8747;y make&#8747; nation&#8747; under the ma&#8747;que of peace ill at ea&#8747;e with each other, or when civil admini&#8747;tration i&#8747; held with a lax hand, or again when the governor&#8747; of the out&#8747;ide province&#8747;, from private intere&#8747;t&#8747; or pique, connive at their practice&#8747;, will too often receive a tacit encouragement. But add to the&#8747;e, even in better time&#8747;, the advantage&#8747; of night, &#8747;ecrecy, and by-way&#8747;; the ob&#8747;tacle&#8747; to regular judicial inquiry, from difference of law&#8747; under different government&#8747;; the patronage and prote&#392;tion of their immediate lord&#8747;, of relation&#8747; and neighbour&#8747;; together with the force of example handed down from father to &#8747;on for many generation&#8747;; and we need not wonder, if &#8747;uch a di&#8747;ea&#8747;e acquired no &#8747;mall degree of virulence. There may, however, be &#8747;till more rea&#8747;on&#8747; a&#8747;&#8747;igned; for when &#8747;uch a people are uncertain to which government they belong, or are continually changing their ma&#8747;ter&#8747;, they are willing enough to think they belong to neither, may make incur&#8747;ion&#8747; on both, or fight out their own quarrel&#8747; among&#8747;t them&#8747;elve&#8747;, without imagining that they are accountable to any one. Be&#8747;ide&#8747;, individual&#8747; of thi&#8747; ca&#8747;t are too apt, when their fortune&#8747; are de&#8747;perate, to forget that they have any native country at all, and to con&#8747;ider every thing a&#8747; lawful game; or even, from a cu&#8747;tom &#8747;o long nouri&#8747;hed in the lap of barbarity, may never dream that &#8747;uch a&#392;tion&#8747; are criminal, and perhap&#8747; con&#8747;ider them a&#8747; requi&#8747;ite&#8747; of life. Moreover, when wrenched by force from one party, or &#8747;urrendered with a grudge, their pra&#392;tice&#8747; may be abetted by that party a&#8747; the hope&#8747; of a war, and the mean&#8747; of recovery. There might, without doubt, were we more intimately acquainted with circum&#8747;tance&#8747;, be many more cau&#8747;e&#8747; adduced to confirm the likeline&#8747;&#8747; of a durable and exten&#8747;ive effe&#392;t attached to &#8747;uch a life; but the&#8747;e which are already mentioned, and for which there i&#8747; undoubted authority with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to their application in the pre&#8747;ent purpo&#8747;e, are &#8747;ufficient to per&#8747;uade any one that they were enough to produce certain effe&#392;t&#8747;, which would add new horror and cruelty to them&#8747;elve&#8747;; namely, old wrong&#8747; to avenge, and hereditary antipathie&#8747; to gratify. But it ought not to be forgot, that &#8747;uch men, by their continual acquaintance with danger, and their knowledge of the country; by their hardine&#8747;&#8747;, &#8747;ubtlety, and &#8747;wiftne&#8747;&#8747;, would be excellent attendant&#8747; on more regular armie&#8747;; they would be well qualified for parti&#8747;an&#8747;, forager&#8747; and &#8747;pie&#8747;; and from thence might receive additional encouragement; nay, we know that the bulk of many armie&#8747; ha&#8747; con&#8747;i&#8747;ted of them: they will be, without doubt, extremely fierce and cruel; for with war a certain degree of barbarity will creep into mankind; but habitual war, and ince&#8747;&#8747;ant violence mu&#8747;t en&#8747;avage them &#8747;trangely: Hi&#8747;tory uniformly a&#8747;cribe&#8747; principle&#8747; like the&#8747;e to a wild people, and generally find&#8747; them wild in a &#8747;ituation like thi&#8747; of which we are &#8747;peaking.</p> 
<p>VI. When a country i&#8747; expo&#8747;ed to continual inva&#8747;ion&#8747; from a neighbouring enemy, it&#8747; mean&#8747; of defence will be proportionally numerou&#8747;. A regular government generally e&#8747;tabli&#8747;he&#8747; a chain of fort&#8747;, or of military &#8747;tation&#8747;, for it&#8747; defence; or, a&#8747; the Chine&#8747;e have done, and a&#8747; the Roman&#8747; did in more place&#8747; than one, build&#8747; a barrier &#8747;till more continuou&#8747; to exclude the invader&#8747;. But in the half-anarchy of the feudal &#8747;y&#8747;tem, every petty lord had hi&#8747; ca&#8747;tle to defend hi&#8747; domain and hi&#8747; own hoard, independent of tho&#8747;e that were maintained at the public charge. One mode had in view the &#8747;ecurity of a whole province; the other, whil&#8747;t it weakened the fir&#8747;t, more immediately regarded the property of individual&#8747;. One expe&#392;t&#8747;, in the fir&#8747;t ca&#8747;e, numerou&#8747; encampment&#8747;, fortre&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;, and military &#8747;tation&#8747;; in the latter, that when the defence of the inhabitant&#8747; i&#8747; left in a great mea&#8747;ure to them&#8747;elve&#8747;, every hou&#8747;e will be a&#8747; &#8747;trong a&#8747; the owner can afford to make it, or will be built on an eminence for the &#8747;ake of a good look-out; but, if neither of the&#8747;e can be accompli&#8747;hed, will be in the vicinity of &#8747;ome &#8747;trong place, to which it&#8747; inhabitant&#8747; may withdraw for &#8747;helter. Again: When a detached kingdom retain&#8747; it&#8747; independence long after tho&#8747;e contiguou&#8747; to it; it&#8747; manner&#8747; and religiou&#8747; rite&#8747;, when tho&#8747;e of the other&#8747; are aboli&#8747;hed, or changed by the intru&#8747;ion of &#8747;tranger&#8747;, we expe&#392;t it &#8747;hould retain proportionally fre&#8747;her mark&#8747; of it&#8747; former condition.

From any one of the&#8747;e con&#8747;ideration&#8747; we look for many ve&#8747;tige&#8747; of elder time&#8747;, but when all are combined in a particular di&#8747;tri&#392;t, it i&#8747; natural to infer that &#8747;uch a di&#8747;tri&#392;t will contain many relic&#8747; of antiquity.</p>
<p>VII. The painter’&#8747; re&#8747;earche&#8747; for view&#8747;, which by a &#8747;ort of irregular &#8747;ymmetry may affe&#392;t the imagination &#8747;trongly, or may plea&#8747;e the eye by richne&#8747;&#8747; of tint&#8747; or variety of &#8747;hade&#8747;, are generally gratified where the ruder boldne&#8747;&#8747; of mountain&#8747; i&#8747; contra&#8747;ted with the rich foliage of tree&#8747;, or with &#8747;heet&#8747; or &#8747;tream&#8747; of water: or where cloud&#8747; and vapour&#8747; inter&#8747;per&#8747;e varietie&#8747; of aerial &#8747;cenery, that change a&#8747; it were by magic, impre&#8747;&#8747;ing on the obje&#392;t&#8747; within their effe&#392;t a hue and ca&#8747;t of appearance that &#8747;carce &#8747;eem&#8747; earthly. He chu&#8747;e&#8747; hi&#8747; &#8747;tation&#8747; where the&#8747;e may not only meet at once, but in &#8747;uch an arrangement a&#8747; may &#8747;trike the mind powerfully, and leave their impre&#8747;&#8747;ion and image upon the memory. Where painting goe&#8747;, there generally goe&#8747; poetry; their walk&#8747; are the &#8747;ame; their beloved &#8747;cene&#8747; are &#8747;imilar, and have alway&#8747; been &#8747;o from the Grecian tempe, to the green glen&#8747; of Britain.</p>
<p>VIII. Wherever there are mountain&#8747;, there are certain change&#8747; of weather, quite di&#8747;&#8747;imilar to tho&#8747;e which are experienced in leveller place&#8747;; nay, there are diver&#8747;itie&#8747; of climate in place&#8747; equally mountainou&#8747;, ari&#8747;ing from the different dire&#392;tion&#8747; of their hill&#8747;, wind&#8747; may be diverted from their original cour&#8747;e, and part of them &#8747;o diverted a&#8747; to cro&#8747;&#8747; and interrupt each other; or they may be precipitated from the &#8747;ummit&#8747;; or, again, in &#8747;ome ca&#8747;e&#8747; generated by a mere agglomeration of cloud&#8747; or mi&#8747;t&#8747;. Now, it i&#8747; well known what a material effe&#392;t wind&#8747; have upon the weather, or rather how intimately they are conne&#392;ted with it: and wherever the ob&#8747;erver&#8747; of the &#8747;ea&#8747;on&#8747; find their progno&#8747;tic&#8747; changed from tho&#8747;e of the low land&#8747;, where they are mo&#8747;t commonly made, (becau&#8747;e there they can be made with more certainty, and earlier with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to their con&#8747;equence&#8747;,) there mu&#8747;t be an amazing tra&#392;t for natural philo&#8747;ophy to walk in, and examine the cau&#8747;e&#8747;: yet thi&#8747; it may do with more ea&#8747;e in a hilly country, than a level one; becau&#8747;e among&#8747;t hill&#8747; the effe&#392;t&#8747; more immediately follow the cau&#8747;e, and both may be ob&#8747;erved almo&#8747;t at once. In either ca&#8747;e, it may perhap&#8747; divert a cla&#8747;&#8747;ic reader to compare the modern ru&#8747;tic method of foretelling weather, with that of He&#8747;iod and Virgil.</p>
<p>It will ea&#8747;ily be &#8747;een, that the preceding paragraph&#8747; have no regular plan in them&#8747;elve&#8747;, nor dependence upon each other: they are indeed only &#8747;o many di&#8747;tin&#392;t theme&#8747; on which I mean to comment, without ob&#8747;erving any order, or having any other reference but what regard&#8747; the plan&#8747;. However, a&#8747; they are very diffu&#8747;e in their nature, it may not be ami&#8747;&#8747; to &#8747;ubjoin a general application of each, and &#8747;hew in what manner they concern the bu&#8747;ine&#8747;&#8747; which I have undertaken.</p>
<p>I. With re&#8747;pe&#392;t to the fir&#8747;t, I cannot begin thi&#8747; &#8747;ubje&#392;t better than with an ob&#8747;ervation of &#8747;ir Walter Raleigh’&#8747;. &#8747;peaking of that pa&#8747;&#8747;age in Herodotu&#8747;, wherein he a&#8747;cribe&#8747; the great war&#8747; between the Per&#8747;ian&#8747; and Greek&#8747; to the vanity of Ato&#8747;&#8747;a the Per&#8747;ian Queen, who being de&#8747;irou&#8747; of having &#8747;ome Grecian bondwoman, teized her hu&#8747;band till he began that terrible conte&#8747;t; &#8747;ir Walter &#8747;ay&#8747;, “Thi&#8747; I may boldly affirm, (having, “ I think, in every e&#8747;tate &#8747;ome &#8747;ufficient witne&#8747;&#8747;,) that matter&#8747; of much con&#8747;equence, “ founded, in all &#8747;eeming, upon &#8747;ub&#8747;tantial rea&#8747;on&#8747;, have i&#8747;&#8747;ued indeed from “ &#8747;uch petty trifle&#8747;, a&#8747; no hi&#8747;torian would either think upon, or could well &#8747;earch out." To thi&#8747; &#8747;entiment I &#8747;o entirely accede, a&#8747; to believe, that more than half of the great affair&#8747; of thi&#8747; world might, had we but the proper clue, be traced to &#8747;ome in&#8747;ignificancy or other a&#8747; their origin: for if we &#8747;ay that trifle&#8747; affe&#392;t the mind&#8747; of men in the mo&#8747;t eminent &#8747;tation&#8747;, we may in&#8747;tance the proffer of a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;tance made by the Grand &#8747;ignior to Henry IV. of France, merely becau&#8747;e the former hated the word <i>League</i>. What dreadful havock wa&#8747; occa&#8747;ioned in England by a ca&#8747;ual amour, and &#8747;ub&#8747;equent marriage of Edward IV.! Affair&#8747; purely dome&#8747;tic made Henry VIII. &#8747;hake off the Pope’&#8747; &#8747;upremacy; and a ludicrou&#8747; pre&#8747;ent of a few tenni&#8747;-ball&#8747; i&#8747; &#8747;aid not a little to have exa&#8747;perated that

great conte&#8747;t for empire between the king&#8747; of France and England. The fine&#8747;t library in the world owed it&#8747; de&#8747;tru&#392;tion to the Alexandrine war, which took it&#8747; ri&#8747;e from an amorou&#8747; interview between C&#230;&#8747;ar and Cleopatra; and the pitiful logic of an Arabian zealot de&#8747;troyed another. But in&#8747;tance&#8747; of &#8747;uch event&#8747; are numberle&#8747;&#8747;, nor are tho&#8747;e fewer the execution of which depend upon multitude&#8747;. Thu&#8747; the over-forwardne&#8747;&#8747; and wantonne&#8747;&#8747; of a tax-gatherer cau&#8747;ed that mighty in&#8747;urre&#392;tion of the Kenti&#8747;h Common&#8747; which di&#8747;turbed the reign of Richard II.; and the &#8747;teadine&#8747;&#8747; of a poor, old, in&#8747;ignificant prie&#8747;t, fir&#8747;t gave con&#8747;i&#8747;tency to the Reformation in &#8747;cotland. The confinement of a few gladiator&#8747; gave being to trouble&#8747; which challenged the &#8747;trength of the Roman Legion&#8747;; and the&#8747;e outrage&#8747; in Judea, which did not terminate but in the almo&#8747;t entire extin&#392;tion of the Jewi&#8747;h name, are generally referred to the di&#8747;mi&#8747;&#8747;ion of &#8747;ome workmen from the building of the la&#8747;t Temple. I forbear further in&#8747;tance&#8747;; and &#8747;hall only a&#8747;k, To what more important cau&#8747;e can we a&#8747;cribe tho&#8747;e religiou&#8747; quarrel&#8747; with which almo&#8747;t the whole world ha&#8747; at time&#8747; been di&#8747;turbed? Whoever con&#8747;ider&#8747; the vanity, or &#8747;uper&#8747;tition, or other weakne&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747; incident to the mo&#8747;t eminent men, will not wonder at &#8747;uch thing&#8747; a&#8747; &#8747;trange, any more than that the falling of an apple &#8747;hould &#8747;ugge&#8747;t to the comprehen&#8747;ive &#8747;oul of Newton, the idea of that great principle which regulate&#8747; all nature. Though the&#8747;e &#8747;ame weakne&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747; in the mind&#8747; of the multitude may perhap&#8747; operate with a greater force, there generally are found &#8747;ome more remote, or perhap&#8747; collateral incident&#8747;, nece&#8747;&#8747;ary to give them effe&#392;t; of which we might bring illu&#8747;tration&#8747;: but I am afraid that thi&#8747; digre&#8747;&#8747;ion i&#8747; already too long; I only meant it a&#8747; an argument of my more immediate &#8747;ubje&#392;t, to which I therefore return.</p>
<p>The di&#8747;turbance&#8747; on the border&#8747; of England and &#8747;cotland have frequently been the plea, and &#8747;ometime&#8747; the cau&#8747;e of mo&#8747;t &#8747;eriou&#8747; affair&#8747;; yet the&#8747;e di&#8747;turbance&#8747;, (&#8747;uch wa&#8747; the temper of the people,) were begun, and continually fo&#8747;tered by the mo&#8747;t unaccountable trifle&#8747;. If they met at a fair, or a merry-making, &#8747;ome or other of them got engaged in a quarrel; each party had numerou&#8747; favourer&#8747; and abettor&#8747;, and thu&#8747; the conte&#8747;t became general: it wa&#8747; carried home by every individual, and they only came back to revenge it. Thu&#8747; mutual in&#8747;ult&#8747; and injurie&#8747; made mutual complaint&#8747; and ju&#8747;tification&#8747; nece&#8747;&#8747;ary; the&#8747;e delayed the cure, and thi&#8747; delay wa&#8747; not a little increa&#8747;ed by the &#8747;trange nature of the law&#8747; which prevailed in tho&#8747;e di&#8747;tri&#392;t&#8747;: the mi&#8747;chief, in con&#8747;equence, received continual increa&#8747;e, till it became of a &#8747;ize for general hi&#8747;tory. In the year 1369, a fair wa&#8747; held at Roxburgh during a peace between the two nation&#8747;: at thi&#8747; fair a quarrel aro&#8747;e among&#8747;t the Borderer&#8747;, a&#8747; wa&#8747; generally the ca&#8747;e, and a &#8747;cot&#8747;man, &#8747;ervant to the Earl of March, wa&#8747; killed. Among&#8747;t the cu&#8747;tom&#8747;, and even law&#8747; of the&#8747;e &#8747;trange people, a certain atonement for blood wa&#8747; one; and thi&#8747; atonement not being made on the pre&#8747;ent occa&#8747;ion, hi&#8747; ma&#8747;ter took up the quarrel, in which he wa&#8747; a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;ted by the Gordon and other&#8747;. The&#8747;e began to ravage the oppo&#8747;ite marche&#8747; in a terrible manner, and of cour&#8747;e called forth the Warden&#8747; of tho&#8747;e marche&#8747;, &#8747;ir John &#8747;ilburn, and the Piercy, to repel the inva&#8747;ion, and to take vengeance by &#8747;imilar mean&#8747;. Thu&#8747; the confine&#8747; at large of both kingdom&#8747;, and the countie&#8747; adjoining, became in a great mea&#8747;ure a &#8747;cene of de&#8747;olation; and con&#8747;iderable number&#8747; of men peri&#8747;hed, in &#8747;everal rough encounter&#8747;, during it&#8747; continuance. Again: In the year 1377, another fair wa&#8747; held at Roxburgh, which wa&#8747; terminated by a &#8747;imilar quarrel, in which the town it&#8747;elf wa&#8747; burnt. To revenge thi&#8747;, the Piercy, now Earl of Northumberland, entered &#8747;cotland with an army, which i&#8747; &#8747;aid to have con&#8747;i&#8747;ted of ten thou&#8747;and men, and for three day&#8747; ravaged the land&#8747; of the Earl of March. Hunting partie&#8747;, be&#8747;ide&#8747;, were produ&#392;tive of frequent outrage&#8747;. I do not mean &#8747;uch partie&#8747; a&#8747; were made &#8747;ometime&#8747; in open defiance by the turbulent and powerful chieftain&#8747; of the north; but the poaching companie&#8747;, who &#8747;eldom or never de&#8747;ired a fair field, nor were prepared for much oppo&#8747;ition. It i&#8747; &#8747;omewhat &#8747;ingular, that though, in time&#8747; of peace, people of the one march were &#8747;eldom hindred, upon a&#8747;king leave, to hunt in the wa&#8747;te ground&#8747; of the other; yet the humor wa&#8747; &#8747;uch, a&#8747; very &#8747;eldom to u&#8747;e any &#8747;uch friendly application. Hence, the hunter&#8747; were generally driven home again, and puni&#8747;hed, according to the &#8747;pirit of the time&#8747;, by a few robberie&#8747;, &#8747;laughter&#8747;, and burning&#8747; within their own boundarie&#8747;. Thu&#8747; wa&#8747; a war begun, which &#8747;pread, &#8747;ometime&#8747;

more, and &#8747;ometime&#8747; le&#8747;&#8747;, into the neighbouring kingdom&#8747;; but, for the mo&#8747;t part, found an ample &#8747;upply among&#8747;t the ira&#8747;cible temper&#8747; in it&#8747; neighbourhood. Hi&#8747;tory take&#8747; notice of &#8747;ome of the&#8747;e: but without making many quotation&#8747;, it may &#8747;uffice to remember, that in the time of profound peace a real Chevy-Chace would have been a&#392;ted in the reign of Jame&#8747; I. but for the intervention of &#8747;ome per&#8747;on&#8747; of authority and moderation. A few hunter&#8747; appeared upon the We&#8747;t-Marche&#8747; of England: they were expo&#8747;tulated with; and refu&#8747;ing to return, both partie&#8747; were gathering their &#8747;trength to an effe&#392;tual determination. But I know not that any thing ha&#8747; furni&#8747;hed &#8747;o many incitement&#8747; to mi&#8747;chief a&#8747; the matche&#8747; at foot-ball&#8747; which u&#8747;ed to be played in the&#8747;e part&#8747;, province again&#8747;t province. The cu&#8747;tom i&#8747; not yet ob&#8747;olete; and within the&#8747;e la&#8747;t &#8747;ixty year&#8747;, though at that time the animo&#8747;ity, rivalry, and con&#8747;equently the number&#8747; of it&#8747; attendant&#8747; were much dimini&#8747;hed, yet it wa&#8747; &#8747;till played with great violence, and by &#8747;everal hundred&#8747; on a &#8747;ide. When men are heated with &#8747;uch exerci&#8747;e, and half angry with the rebuff&#8747; of the game, it i&#8747; inconceivable what di&#8747;turbance and uproar the quarrel of two per&#8747;on&#8747; can produce, even among&#8747;t friend&#8747; and neighbour&#8747;; but much greater mu&#8747;t the damage have been among&#8747;t men inflamed by the animo&#8747;ity of age&#8747;. I have heard many traditional &#8747;torie&#8747;, which &#8747;till remembered the tragedie&#8747; to which the&#8747;e matche&#8747;, a&#8747; well a&#8747; the hunting partie&#8747;, had given birth; and in the neighbourhood of the Liddle, E&#8747;k, and Leven, they may &#8747;till be heard. But Dr Burn, in hi&#8747; hi&#8747;tory of Cumberland and We&#8747;tmoreland, give&#8747; a regular account of one, wherein, though they fought only with club&#8747; and &#8747;take&#8747;, yet a con&#8747;iderable number of men were killed. The&#8747;e matche&#8747;, like other pa&#8747;time&#8747;, were held on &#8747;unday&#8747;, or &#8747;ome other holy day&#8747;, and by a &#8747;trong &#8747;imilarity of circum&#8747;tance&#8747; pre&#8747;ent a &#8747;triking pi&#392;ture of the &#8747;olemn time&#8747; and barbarou&#8747; fea&#8747;t&#8747; of &#8747;avage&#8747;. Now it i&#8747; impo&#8747;&#8747;ible but &#8747;uch proceeding&#8747; mu&#8747;t draw the notice of the legi&#8747;lative authority of the country; but then the judge&#8747; of &#8747;uch affair&#8747; were men of the &#8747;ame &#8747;tamp with tho&#8747;e who committed them: for the mo&#8747;t part, they wanted little or no incitement to head and enforce the quarrel of their va&#8747;&#8747;al&#8747; and dependent&#8747;. It wa&#8747; then that the con&#8747;equence&#8747; of the&#8747;e bauble&#8747; became more or le&#8747;&#8747; noticed by real hi&#8747;tory; and afforded, a&#8747; I &#8747;aid before, &#8747;ometime&#8747; a cau&#8747;e, and often a plea to great and national war&#8747;.</p>
<p>The almo&#8747;t uniform train of circum&#8747;tance&#8747; which affe&#392;ted the&#8747;e countrie&#8747; from their border &#8747;ituation, and the little difference there wa&#8747; between one of the dark age&#8747; and another, &#8747;trongly induce me to believe, that the Northern people were little altered in manner&#8747; from very remote time&#8747;, to tho&#8747;e immediately preceding the reign of Queen Elizabeth; and the &#8747;ubje&#392;t which I have been treating upon tempt&#8747; me to relate one &#8747;tory, a&#8747; an exemplification of it. Guthrie, in hi&#8747; Hi&#8747;tory of England, &#8747;ay&#8747;, “ that a “ Wel&#8747;h Chronicle, of an old date, mention&#8747; a battle fought at Arderydd, (probably Arthuret,) “ upon the border&#8747; of &#8747;cotland, between Aidan Uradog, or the Treacherou&#8747;, and “Guendeleu, Briti&#8747;h Prince&#8747; in the North of England, on the one &#8747;ide; and Reiderck “ Hoel, Prince of the &#8747;ame country, on the other, <i>upon no more important a quarrel than a lark’&#8747; “ ne&#8747;t and two dog&#8747;</i>. Thi&#8747; battle wa&#8747; fatal to Guendeleu, who wa&#8747; killed, and Aidan wa&#8747; “ obliged to fly to the I&#8747;le of Man."</p>
<p>There &#8747;till remain&#8747; to mention another trifle, which wa&#8747; a nur&#8747;ery to the di&#8747;order&#8747;, and an inexhau&#8747;tible &#8747;ource of contention: thi&#8747; wa&#8747; the <i>debateable ground</i>; of which I &#8747;hall relate nothing but what the order for it&#8747; &#8747;ettlement in the day&#8747; of Edward VI. authori&#8747;e&#8747;. It&#8747; length could not exceed 5 mile&#8747;, extending from E&#8747;k to &#8747;ark at Dimmi&#8747;dale &#8747;yke-foot, and thence to Kirk-ling: yet thi&#8747; wa&#8747; only the boundary of the kingdom&#8747; then made; for the real boundary wa&#8747; never known before, with certainty, in thi&#8747; piece of ground, on account of the immemorial di&#8747;order&#8747; which had prevailed there, and even the antiquity of it&#8747; being <i>debateable</i> wa&#8747; too remote for the longe&#8747;t-lived tradition. It i&#8747; &#8747;aid that thi&#8747; trifling piece of ground, from the mo&#8747;t trifling circum&#8747;tance&#8747;, had given birth to prodigiou&#8747;, and, if we re&#8747;pe&#392;t the cau&#8747;e&#8747;, a&#8747;toni&#8747;hing commotion&#8747; between the two kingdom&#8747;; being the &#8747;ink and receptacle of pro&#8747;cribed wretche&#8747;, who acknowledged neither King, obeyed the law&#8747; of neither country, and feared no puni&#8747;hment: that hence they grew to &#8747;uch a pitch of boldne&#8747;&#8747;, a&#8747; to live entirely

on &#8747;poil&#8747;, to plunder each &#8747;ide, and, having allured partner&#8747; to &#8747;hare their irregularitie&#8747;, to do all manner of mi&#8747;chief. To fini&#8747;h therefore thi&#8747; evil, the foregoing boundary wa&#8747; drawn by the con&#8747;ent of both, and pyramid&#8747; of hewn &#8747;tone ere&#392;ted, that the law&#8747; of each country might more preci&#8747;ely and effe&#392;tually reach the&#8747;e villain&#8747;: however, their old habit&#8747; were not thu&#8747; eradicated, even after the kingdom&#8747; had both one King, (though one may rea&#8747;onably conje&#392;ture that thi&#8747; di&#8747;po&#8747;ition would then gradually have fallen away of it&#8747;elf,) till Jame&#8747; I. whether or no to facilitate the journey&#8747; of hi&#8747; <i>dun-cow</i> i&#8747; not recorded, made &#8747;ome &#8747;ort of a tran&#8747;portation or di&#8747;per&#8747;ion of thi&#8747; &#8747;et of inhabitant&#8747;, and &#8747;ince that time the mi&#8747;chief ha&#8747; cea&#8747;ed.</p>
<p>&#8747;uch were &#8747;ome of the in&#8747;ignificant cau&#8747;e&#8747;, which have either given birth to great war&#8747;, or have been alledged a&#8747; the rea&#8747;on of them, to cover the real one; or when excited indeed by other motive&#8747;, and avowed a&#8747; &#8747;uch, have fed their malignity with continual and perniciou&#8747; material&#8747;; in&#8747;omuch, that, what wa&#8747; &#8747;aid by Velleiu&#8747; Paterculu&#8747; to have been the ca&#8747;e for 115 year&#8747; in the conte&#8747;t between Rome and Carthage, ha&#8747;, by their mean&#8747;, been much more properly applied here, and that for a length of time prodigiou&#8747;ly greater, <i>viz</i>. Between the&#8747;e people, there wa&#8747; either war, or preparation for war, or a peace that wa&#8747; never ob&#8747;erved, for &#8747;everal centurie&#8747;. However, a&#8747; oft a&#8747; I think of the&#8747;e de&#8747;tru&#392;tive trifle&#8747;, I cannot help calling to mind a &#8747;entence of Pope &#8747;ixtu&#8747; Quintu&#8747;, which I have &#8747;omewhere read. A friar, who had formerly been an intimate of thi&#8747; Pope, came to vi&#8747;it him after hi&#8747; exaltation, and being encouraged to u&#8747;e hi&#8747; former familiarity, told him, he wondered how he, a plain man, had acquired the triple crown, which &#8747;o many &#8747;ubtle &#8747;pirit&#8747; wi&#8747;hed for in vain! To thi&#8747; the Pope an&#8747;wered, “ Had&#8747;t “ thou been abroad a&#8747; I have been, and &#8747;een by what folly the world i&#8747; governed, thou “ would&#8747;t wonder at nothing."</p>
<p>I cannot quit thi&#8747; &#8747;ubje&#392;t, without taking notice of that &#8747;uperiority in archery which the Engli&#8747;h have alway&#8747; boa&#8747;ted, and which ha&#8747; had &#8747;o material an effe&#392;t in almo&#8747;t all the battle&#8747; which they formerly fought, again&#8747;t different mode&#8747; of di&#8747;cipline, and different nation&#8747;. Whatever effe&#392;t political regulation&#8747; might have had in pre&#8747;erving thi&#8747; &#8747;uperiority, or whatever the con&#8747;equent pra&#392;tice of it a&#8747; an amu&#8747;ement may have done, I think I may &#8747;afely aver, that the cu&#8747;tom of poaching occa&#8747;ioned by the &#8747;everity of the game-law&#8747; e&#8747;tabli&#8747;hed by the conqueror, had no &#8747;mall effe&#392;t in pre&#8747;erving it. It wa&#8747; thi&#8747; that produced &#8747;o many noted archer&#8747; and outlaw&#8747; in the fore&#8747;t of Englewood a&#8747; well a&#8747; that of &#8747;herwood. For, not to mention Adam Bell and hi&#8747; partner&#8747;, tradition &#8747;till pre&#8747;erve&#8747; the name&#8747; of Watty of Croglin, Woodhead Andrew, Robin Oth’moor&#8747;, Gruff Elleck (Alexander,) and of &#8747;everal other&#8747;, a&#8747; of per&#8747;on&#8747; di&#8747;tingui&#8747;hed in that line, even among&#8747;t a people who were almo&#8747;t to a man of the &#8747;ame &#8747;tamp. Be&#8747;ide&#8747;, a&#8747; their &#8747;quabble&#8747; and the &#8747;ub&#8747;equent maroding&#8747; made the &#8747;kill thu&#8747; acquired at time&#8747; ab&#8747;olutely nece&#8747;&#8747;ary to the inhabitant&#8747; on each &#8747;ide of the boundary, we may ea&#8747;ily conclude, that a nece&#8747;&#8747;ity of thi&#8747; kind, continually kept alive, mu&#8747;t produce no &#8747;mall degree of dexterity. In addition to the motive&#8747; which might induce the inferior countrie&#8747; of England to exerci&#8747;e them&#8747;elve&#8747; in archery, in the border&#8747;, wa&#8747; &#8747;elf-defence, and the provi&#8747;ion of &#8747;u&#8747;tenance: two motive&#8747; alway&#8747; powerful, and in tho&#8747;e part&#8747; unremittingly urgent. Thu&#8747; the trifle&#8747; which continued it&#8747; u&#8747;e, and the trifle&#8747; which made that u&#8747;e needful, when combined together, and dire&#392;ted by particular contingencie&#8747;, affe&#392;ted, by their number and colle&#392;ted force, the hi&#8747;tory of the time&#8747; in a very di&#8747;tingui&#8747;hed manner. Whoever will con&#8747;ider the circum&#8747;tance&#8747; of the battle&#8747; which were then fought, will find, that wherever the ground or circum&#8747;tance&#8747; favoured the archer&#8747; for a number of regular di&#8747;charge&#8747;, they generally produced &#8747;uch a confu&#8747;ion, particularly among&#8747;t the enemy’&#8747; hor&#8747;e, a&#8747; gave the men at arm&#8747; of their own party an opportunity of ea&#8747;ily compleating it. I need cite no further particular&#8747; of thi&#8747; than the battle of Homeldon, when the force&#8747; of the Northern Marche&#8747; encountered the gallant Archibald Earl of Dougla&#8747;; the men at arm&#8747; &#8747;tood &#8747;till that day, and the bowmen had the whole bu&#8747;ine&#8747;&#8747; upon their hand&#8747;. It i&#8747; recorded, that no armour could re&#8747;i&#8747;t their arrow&#8747;, though that of Earl Dougla&#8747; and hi&#8747; a&#8747;&#8747;ociate&#8747; had been three year&#8747; in making.</p>

<p>It would &#8747;eem indeed (by the bye) that the &#8747;cot&#8747; excelled in the u&#8747;e of the &#8747;pear, and (excepting the Borderer&#8747;) negle&#392;ted the bow; &#8747;ince one of their own King&#8747; i&#8747; thought to have recommended it&#8747; more general u&#8747;e, by ridiculing their imperfe&#392;t management of it. [&#8747;ee Poem&#8747; of Jame&#8747; I.]</p>
<p>A people accu&#8747;tomed to be called to the field on &#8747;uch trifling occa&#8747;ion&#8747;, and inured to hard&#8747;hip&#8747; by &#8747;uch cau&#8747;e&#8747;, were al&#8747;o very ready to help forward commotion&#8747; of a larger &#8747;cale. Here Henry IV. had hi&#8747; fir&#8747;t dawn of empire; and the Piercie&#8747;, with their border-friend&#8747;, afterward&#8747; almo&#8747;t &#8747;hook him from hi&#8747; throne. The battle of &#8747;hrew&#8747;bury wa&#8747; one of the fierce&#8747;t in the Engli&#8747;h hi&#8747;tory, and ha&#8747; moreover had &#8747;hake&#8747;peare for it&#8747; poet. The north al&#8747;o wa&#8747; the nur&#8747;ery of tho&#8747;e armie&#8747; which &#8747;upported the cau&#8747;e of Henry VI. and of Margaret, and &#8747;erved to add to the mi&#8747;erie&#8747; of England &#8747;o much during the conte&#8747;t between the Hou&#8747;e&#8747; of York and Lanca&#8747;ter.</p>
<p>&#8747;uch are a few of the con&#8747;equence&#8747; that may, in my opinion, be fairly deduced from in&#8747;ignificant cau&#8747;e&#8747; in tho&#8747;e part&#8747;, <i>viz</i>. From the little pique&#8747; of individual&#8747; where regular law&#8747; were wanting: and the con&#8747;equent irregularitie&#8747; of life acquired great force, when their effe&#392;t&#8747; were united together, even in thing&#8747; not immediately pertaining to them&#8747;elve&#8747;. Their exa&#392;t commencement i&#8747; lo&#8747;t in antiquity; only I think one may venture to &#8747;ubjoin, that a&#8747; the&#8747;e little thing&#8747; have occa&#8747;ionally produced con&#8747;iderable effe&#392;t&#8747;, &#8747;o they them&#8747;elve&#8747; &#8747;eem to have originated from cau&#8747;e&#8747; &#8747;till more con&#8747;iderable; <i>i.e.</i> the driving of the Northern nation&#8747; &#8747;outhward: a tendency which, though ob&#8747;tructed at interval&#8747;, continued &#8747;till to exi&#8747;t, and make a figure in hi&#8747;tory, from the time when the Cimmerian&#8747; broke into Upper A&#8747;ia, to time&#8747; which were long after the fall of the Roman empire. The trace&#8747; remained, and the&#8747;e are &#8747;ome of them; which, whatever may be thought, were much elder than the animo&#8747;itie&#8747; excited by the fir&#8747;t Edward, though the appointment of Lord Warden&#8747; might &#8747;omewhat alter their appearance. &#8747;o much for a comment and application of the fir&#8747;t paragraph: I now proceed to the &#8747;econd.</p>
<p>II. From what motive it i&#8747; I know not, except it i&#8747; from the prejudice&#8747; of habit, that per&#8747;on&#8747;, who have been accu&#8747;tomed to a wandering un&#8747;ettled life, and &#8747;uch a&#8747; cultivation would pronounce unhappy, reje&#392;t the convenience&#8747; of regular life with wonderful per&#8747;everance; but gyp&#8747;ie&#8747; and vagrant&#8747; furni&#8747;h daily and indi&#8747;putable proof&#8747; of it&#8747; being &#8747;o. Their fondne&#8747;&#8747; for continual migration &#8747;eem&#8747; to have been &#8747;ucked in with their mother’&#8747; milk; and one would think, that they found among&#8747;t the comfort&#8747; of &#8747;ociety, certain re&#8747;traint&#8747;, which it not only irked them to bear, but which far overbalanced all it&#8747; benefit&#8747;. &#8747;urely there i&#8747; in the mind of man a &#8747;trange longing for freedom; and when cu&#8747;tom, &#8747;ometime&#8747; &#8747;tronger than nature, accord&#8747; with it, their united effort&#8747; mu&#8747;t be very powerful. The I&#8747;aurian&#8747; were a &#8747;mall nation in the heart of the Roman empire; they dwelt among&#8747;t mountain&#8747;; they &#8747;aw civilization on every &#8747;ide, yet they reje&#392;ted it with &#8747;corn; and, on occa&#8747;ion&#8747;, found employment for the Legion&#8747; through the cour&#8747;e of &#8747;everal age&#8747;. The E&#8747;kimaux return&#8747; with glee from our luxurie&#8747; to hi&#8747; native de&#8747;art&#8747;, and to feed on train-oil, or &#8747;tinking blubber. The Indian&#8747;, who have been educated in the &#8747;chool&#8747; of North-America, revolt to the barbari&#8747;m of their father&#8747;. The &#8747;wi&#8747;&#8747;, when in the &#8747;ervice of foreign &#8747;tate&#8747;, have many of them died of a longing to revi&#8747;it the mountain&#8747; where they &#8747;pent their infancy; and the di&#8747;order ha&#8747; acquired, a&#8747; it ju&#8747;tly merited, a name of it&#8747; own. And thu&#8747; the vagrant, who perhap&#8747; never &#8747;lept in a cradle, yearn&#8747; for a windy barn and a bed of &#8747;traw, in&#8747;tead of our boa&#8747;ted convenience&#8747;; which, whil&#8747;t cu&#8747;tom had made grateful to u&#8747;, it hath made unea&#8747;y &#8747;hackle&#8747; to him. It i&#8747; &#8747;illy to blame tho&#8747;e prejudice&#8747; in other&#8747; which can retort &#8747;o ea&#8747;ily upon our own: be&#8747;ide&#8747;, every &#8747;ingle man hath &#8747;ome humor or other, which, though grateful to him, may be the rever&#8747;e to another: and thi&#8747; make&#8747; me oft think, that no one &#8747;hould wonder at prejudice&#8747;, till he ha&#8747; fir&#8747;t tried to give their cau&#8747;e a fair inve&#8747;tigation. The reference which the&#8747;e remark&#8747; have to our pre&#8747;ent bu&#8747;ine&#8747;&#8747;, i&#8747; a&#8747; follow&#8747;.</p>
<p>The people who inhabited the countie&#8747; contiguou&#8747; to the border&#8747; of England and

&#8747;cotland, had a degree of civilization on each &#8747;ide of them which wa&#8747; at lea&#8747;t far &#8747;uperior to their own; and the execution of the law&#8747; of each kingdom, though &#8747;ometime&#8747; interrupted, wa&#8747; upon the whole tolerably &#8747;teady and uniform. Yet nothing of the kind ever got a footing here: the lu&#8747;t of roving and plunder &#8747;upplanted every thing el&#8747;e, and wa&#8747; &#8747;o continual and uninterrupted, a&#8747; to re&#8747;emble in&#8747;tin&#392;t. To their very meeting&#8747; of merriment they came armed; and frequently gave fre&#8747;h ardour, by new quarrel&#8747;, to former animo&#8747;itie&#8747;, even when they met purpo&#8747;ely for a treaty of peace. That they might be more invi&#8747;ible during their <i>outrode&#8747;</i>, and con&#8747;equently le&#8747;&#8747; liable to the effe&#392;t&#8747; of their enemie&#8747;’ vigilance, the colour of their cloathe&#8747; re&#8747;embled that of the &#8747;cene&#8747; of their employment, or of their &#8747;ea&#8747;on of a&#392;tion, that i&#8747;, of a brown heath and a cloudy evening. No knowledge conferred honour here, but that of the art of plundering; <i>viz.</i> of intricate byway&#8747;, of perplexed pa&#8747;&#8747;age&#8747; in &#8747;wamp&#8747; and moor&#8747;, and of the bow. Thu&#8747;, example&#8747; of what might condemn their condu&#392;t were never offered to them, and immemorial cu&#8747;tom &#8747;eemed, a&#8747; it were, to &#8747;an&#392;tify their wildne&#8747;&#8747;. Every Border-man almo&#8747;t, without exception, wa&#8747; brought up in a &#8747;tate which we would call unhappy, and every circum&#8747;tance of hi&#8747; life tended to confirm hi&#8747; partiality for an uncertain bed, and unprovided diet. Danger wa&#8747; hi&#8747; companion from hi&#8747; infancy, and would of cour&#8747;e debar him of the knowledge of many convenience&#8747; of &#8747;ettled life, yet at the &#8747;ame time &#8747;ugge&#8747;t mode&#8747; of convenience and habit&#8747; of amu&#8747;ement, which it would require either real experience or long ob&#8747;ervation to be able to form an idea of. For what conception have we of thing&#8747; which u&#8747;e ha&#8747; not engrafted? Thu&#8747; a Border-man could not want tho&#8747;e ad&#8747;cititiou&#8747; convenience&#8747; which he never knew, though we cannot do without them. He had &#8747;een nothing of human affair&#8747; where there wa&#8747; not toil and hazard; therefore toil and hazard became, of cour&#8747;e, to be con&#8747;idered a&#8747; the nece&#8747;&#8747;ary contingent&#8747; of exi&#8747;tence, were mo&#8747;t intimately blended with it, and could not be detached from it: be&#8747;ide&#8747;, every boy of &#8747;pirit wi&#8747;he&#8747; to be a man, and to be a man in tho&#8747;e time&#8747; and place&#8747; wa&#8747; to watch hi&#8747; own, and plunder other&#8747;. Injurie&#8747; may be forgot, quarrel&#8747; obliterated, and prejudice&#8747; rooted out, in the cour&#8747;e of a man’&#8747; life; but thi&#8747; fondne&#8747;&#8747; for roving, when it ha&#8747; once got hold, i&#8747;, if my private ob&#8747;ervation ha&#8747; not been &#8747;trangely mi&#8747;guided, the mo&#8747;t ob&#8747;tinate of all prepo&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747; and attachment&#8747;. I &#8747;hall therefore call it the leading &#8747;pirit of the Mo&#8747;&#8747;-Trooper&#8747; of both Marche&#8747;. Without doubt, it received, a&#8747; I &#8747;aid before, occa&#8747;ional aid from circum&#8747;tance&#8747;, and wa&#8747; accompanied by other pa&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747;, the antecedent&#8747;, co-temporarie&#8747;, or con&#8747;equent&#8747; of it&#8747;elf, which had a drift to the &#8747;ame end; but it&#8747;elf wa&#8747; the ruling and mo&#8747;t con&#8747;tant principle. That I may not be thought to a&#8747;&#8747;ign the foregoing chara&#392;ter ra&#8747;hly, and without authority, I &#8747;hall &#8747;ubjoin a few circum&#8747;tance&#8747; relative to their temper, out of very many that may be found; and try to give an idea of the men whom a continual acquaintance with danger had trained &#8747;o far a&#8747; to &#8747;port with it.</p> 
<p>&#8747;even de&#8747;peradoe&#8747; of the Marche&#8747;, without any motive that we know of, but their natural re&#8747;tle&#8747;&#8747;ne&#8747;&#8747;, and de&#8747;perate love of plunder and violence, broke into and &#8747;eized upon the ca&#8747;tle of Berwick, killed &#8747;ir Robert Boynton the governor, but di&#8747;mi&#8747;&#8747;ed hi&#8747; family, on condition that they &#8747;hould either pay 2000 Merk&#8747; for their ran&#8747;om, or return again. In con&#8747;equence of thi&#8747; violence, Piercy of Northumberland, the Lord Warden, made hi&#8747; complaint to the Warden of the &#8747;cot&#8747; Marche&#8747;, who di&#8747;claimed all knowledge of the bu&#8747;ine&#8747;&#8747;, and offered to join hi&#8747; force&#8747; to tho&#8747;e of Piercy toward&#8747; redre&#8747;&#8747;ing it. Upon thi&#8747; Piercy &#8747;ummoned them with all po&#8747;&#8747;ible expedition, in the name of the King of England, and required an immediate &#8747;urrender: but &#8747;o many &#8747;imilar temper&#8747; did the neighbourhood furni&#8747;h, that notwith&#8747;tanding the &#8747;hortne&#8747;&#8747; of the time, their number&#8747; were increa&#8747;ed to 48, who, refu&#8747;ing to yield either to the King of England, or the King of &#8747;cotland, declared that they would keep the fortre&#8747;&#8747; for the King of France only. They were therefore dire&#392;tly inve&#8747;ted by Piercy with 7000 Engli&#8747;h archer&#8747;, and 3000 hor&#8747;e under Neville, Lucy, &#8747;tafford and other&#8747;; again&#8747;t whom they defended the fortre&#8747;&#8747; for eight day&#8747;, with the lo&#8747;&#8747; of only two of their comrade&#8747;; but on the ninth, after a long and furiou&#8747; a&#8747;&#8747;ault, an entry wa&#8747; made by &#8747;torm, and they were all put to the &#8747;word.</p>

<p>Again: When &#8747;ir Matthew Redman, governor of Berwick, wa&#8747; flying from the battle of Otterburn, he wa&#8747; &#8747;ingled out and pur&#8747;ued, on account of hi&#8747; armour, by &#8747;ir Jame&#8747; Lind&#8747;ey; and hi&#8747; hor&#8747;e failing him, after a chace of three mile&#8747;, wa&#8747; obliged to alight and &#8747;tand the combat: upon thi&#8747; the other al&#8747;o alighted, in the true &#8747;pirit of ancient chivalry, and having vanqui&#8747;hed hi&#8747; antagoni&#8747;t, permitted him to depart upon plighting hi&#8747; word to return in twenty day&#8747;. It i&#8747; worthy of remark, that &#8747;uch a contra&#392;t, even among&#8747;t the meane&#8747;t, wa&#8747; &#8747;o &#8747;acred, that the violation of it wa&#8747; accounted infamou&#8747; in the extreme, and deprived a man of all re&#8747;pe&#392;t, even among&#8747;t hi&#8747; former mo&#8747;t intimate friend&#8747;. However, in thi&#8747; ca&#8747;e Redman had no occa&#8747;ion to return, for Lind&#8747;ey being taken on the &#8747;ame day by a party of hi&#8747; garri&#8747;on, wa&#8747; in&#8747;tantly relea&#8747;ed by him, in lieu of the liberty which he him&#8747;elf had received ju&#8747;t before. It i&#8747; well ob&#8747;erved by one hi&#8747;torian, who relate&#8747; thi&#8747; circum&#8747;tance, that the fiercene&#8747;&#8747; and &#8747;ubtlety of the&#8747;e men were &#8747;trangely blended with genero&#8747;ity and good faith, without which war would &#8747;oon de&#8747;troy it&#8747; own vital&#8747;.</p> 
<p>The pre&#8747;ent which &#8747;ir William Marmion received from hi&#8747; favourite lady at an entertainment, and the command which accompanied it, of wearing it in a place of the greate&#8747;t danger, bear&#8747; a &#8747;trong re&#8747;emblance to the romantic tale&#8747; of King Arthur’&#8747; time; and &#8747;erve&#8747;, at lea&#8747;t, to &#8747;hew, that the humor&#8747; and fa&#8747;hion&#8747; of men, particularly in the&#8747;e wild and Northern part&#8747;, wa&#8747; much the &#8747;ame a&#8747; in age&#8747; almo&#8747;t fabulou&#8747;. He repaired, in con&#8747;equence of thi&#8747; mandate, to the famou&#8747; &#8747;iege of Norham ca&#8747;tle, then beleaguered by the &#8747;cot&#8747; and defended by &#8747;ir Thoma&#8747; Grey, a&#8747; to the place mo&#8747;t accordant to the nature of the pre&#8747;ent; and thru&#8747;t him&#8747;elf into every dangerou&#8747; piece of &#8747;ervice which occurred there, that he might acquire a proper right to the favour he had received.</p>
<p>A&#8747; a further &#8747;ample of the prevailing humour of tho&#8747;e martial time&#8747;, what &#8747;ort of prie&#8747;t mu&#8747;t we &#8747;uppo&#8747;e Cre&#8747;&#8747;ingham to have been, who never wore any coat that i&#8747; accounted chara&#392;teri&#8747;tic of profe&#8747;&#8747;ion but that in which he wa&#8747; killed, <i>viz.</i> an iron one? Beck, the fighting Bi&#8747;hop of Carli&#8747;le, wa&#8747; &#8747;o turbulent a mortal, that the Engli&#8747;h King, in order to keep him within bound&#8747;, wa&#8747; obliged to take from him a part of tho&#8747;e po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747; which he had earned in battle, and in particular the living&#8747; of Penrith and &#8747;ymond-Burne. But, not to mention Thur&#8747;tan, who fought the battle of the &#8747;tandard, there are &#8747;ufficient rea&#8747;on&#8747; for believing that mo&#8747;t of the prie&#8747;t&#8747; in the Northern part&#8747; of England had a double profe&#8747;&#8747;ion; and they are &#8747;o often mentioned a&#8747; principal&#8747; in the&#8747;e continual war&#8747;, that one cannot well help concluding that the martial one wa&#8747; more attended to. When the pa&#8747;tor&#8747; are &#8747;uch, what mu&#8747;t the people be!</p>
<p>Indeed, of the little regard that wa&#8747; paid to religion one may take a&#8747; an in&#8747;tance, if the numberle&#8747;&#8747; account&#8747; that are handed down to u&#8747; of churche&#8747; burnt and prie&#8747;t&#8747; ma&#8747;&#8747;acred were wanting, the robbery committed by a parcel of the&#8747;e banditti near Darlington, on the Cardinal&#8747; who were deputed from Rome to make peace between the two nation&#8747;; no regard wa&#8747; paid to the &#8747;an&#392;tity either of their chara&#392;ter or office, but they were &#8747;ent away in a very pitiful condition.</p>
<p>To be convinced of their general di&#8747;po&#8747;ition for cruelty, we need only con&#8747;ult almo&#8747;t any page of their hi&#8747;tory. The infernal &#8747;avagene&#8747;&#8747; of the Gallovegian&#8747; i&#8747; every where noted, and their a&#392;tion&#8747; were mo&#8747;tly requited with a brutality little inferior. But it i&#8747; a notable in&#8747;tance of thi&#8747; di&#8747;po&#8747;ition, (if it be true,) that the &#8747;cot&#8747;, in an incur&#8747;ion into Tindale, walled up a &#8747;chool, and burnt it, together with the children within it. A&#8747; to the temper of the feebler &#8747;ex, one may have &#8747;ome idea of it from the behaviour of the women of Carli&#8747;le, who repul&#8747;ed the &#8747;cot&#8747; in an a&#8747;&#8747;ault by arm&#8747; of their own invention; namely, by pouring hot water upon them from the top of the wall&#8747;: or from the lady who wiped in deri&#8747;ion the place&#8747; where the &#8747;tone&#8747; from the enemie&#8747;’ engine&#8747; had &#8747;truck, with her handkerchief: and indeed from many other circum&#8747;tance&#8747; of female hardine&#8747;&#8747; recorded in their hi&#8747;tory, and &#8747;till more in their tradition&#8747; and old &#8747;ong&#8747;.</p>
<pb n="xv"/>
<p>Of the&#8747;e old &#8747;ong&#8747; I am obliged, by the nature of thi&#8747; &#8747;ubje&#392;t, to take &#8747;ome notice; a&#8747; in them i&#8747; contained a genuine &#8747;ample of their &#8747;pirit, and no &#8747;mall portion of their hi&#8747;tory, and a&#8747; their tradition&#8747; go hand in hand with them, or rather have been kept alive by them: be&#8747;ide&#8747;, that very ob&#8747;curity and &#8747;olitude which ha&#8747; pre&#8747;erved the&#8747;e &#8747;ong&#8747; to thi&#8747; day, by pre&#8747;enting few noveltie&#8747; which might eraze them from the mind&#8747; of men, render&#8747; them little known; wherea&#8747; the anecdote&#8747; immediately preceding may be found in &#8747;everal writer&#8747; on the&#8747;e &#8747;ubje&#392;t&#8747;. But the &#8747;ame motive which prevent&#8747; me from quoting any more of the anecdote&#8747;, <i>viz.</i> the fear of being tediou&#8747; in the recital of thing&#8747; which may ea&#8747;ily be &#8747;een el&#8747;ewhere, prevent&#8747; me al&#8747;o from being any way particular about the&#8747;e; a&#8747; they may be heard from many per&#8747;on&#8747; in the border&#8747;, and a&#8747; &#8747;ome of them are, I believe, printed. In that of Jock-o’-the-&#8747;ide we have a &#8747;pecimen of their method of &#8747;caling wall&#8747;, of their cu&#8747;tom of ran&#8747;oming pri&#8747;oner&#8747; with cattle, of the refuge which one &#8747;ide of the boundary afforded to the ra&#8747;cal&#8747; of the other, of the &#8747;pirit of their je&#8747;t&#8747;, and of their &#8747;ubtlety. In that of Hobby Noble, who i&#8747; mentioned in the former &#8747;ong a&#8747; one of tho&#8747;e ra&#8747;cal&#8747; who had been bani&#8747;hed from Bewca&#8747;tle, hi&#8747; native place, for hi&#8747; crime&#8747;, we &#8747;ee their treachery from Hobby’&#8747; cata&#8747;trophe, and the de&#8747;perate re&#8747;olution that wa&#8747; &#8747;o frequent among&#8747;t them, from hi&#8747; whole condu&#392;t. But we &#8747;ee, mo&#8747;t particularly, of what matchle&#8747;&#8747; e&#8747;timation among&#8747;t them wa&#8747; an accurate knowledge of the &#8747;ecret and almo&#8747;t inexplicable byway&#8747; through moor&#8747; and &#8747;wamp&#8747;. There i&#8747; another &#8747;ong al&#8747;o in the&#8747;e part&#8747; of Dick-o’-the-Cow, whom I cannot help &#8747;u&#8747;pe&#392;ting to be the &#8747;ame with that Richard Coldall who&#8747;e monumental in&#8747;cription remain&#8747; in Penrith Church, and who wa&#8747; called by the country people Dicky-Cow. With thi&#8747; name the women u&#8747;ed to make their children quiet not very long ago, a&#8747; they did for a long &#8747;pace of time in France with the name of Talbot. However thi&#8747; be, the &#8747;ong of Dick-o’-the-Cow exhibit&#8747; a &#8747;trong in&#8747;tance of the encouragement which the petty irregularitie&#8747; of individual&#8747; received from the connivance of their &#8747;uperior&#8747;, a&#8747; well a&#8747; of the uncommon boldne&#8747;&#8747;, dexterity, and cunning, which tho&#8747;e individual&#8747; po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ed. Again: One may form a notion of their ira&#8747;cibility and pronene&#8747;&#8747; to mi&#8747;chief from “the Battle of Red-&#8747;wire," begun by the men of Tindale; and of their diver&#8747;ion&#8747; and amu&#8747;ement&#8747;, from many &#8747;ong&#8747; of either Border. It i&#8747; needle&#8747;&#8747; to make mention in thi&#8747; place of tho&#8747;e which Dr Piercy and other&#8747; have publi&#8747;hed: only I mu&#8747;t beg leave to take notice here of part of a pa&#8747;&#8747;age which the Do&#392;tor in hi&#8747; preface to the “Battle of Otterburne" quote&#8747; from Froi&#8747;&#8747;art, a&#8747; immediately applicable to my purpo&#8747;e. We are there told, after an account of the fury with which the encounter&#8747; of tho&#8747;e Borderer&#8747; were managed, that when one party wa&#8747; well beaten, they would both draw off with a mutual congratulation of, “ God thank you;" a&#8747; if they were very grateful to their enemie&#8747; for giving them an opportunity of engaging in their favourite amu&#8747;ement. Indeed &#8747;hake&#8747;pear &#8747;eem&#8747; to allude to thi&#8747; humor, in one of Fal&#8747;taff’&#8747; &#8747;peeche&#8747; concerning Hot&#8747;pur. And I hold it to be no &#8747;mall argument of the authenticity of the relation&#8747; which the border-&#8747;ong&#8747; contain, a&#8747; well a&#8747; of the genuine&#8747;&#8747; of their de&#8747;cription&#8747; of manner&#8747;, that they are uniformly impregnated with thi&#8747; &#8747;pirit, and frequently tin&#392;tured with a &#8747;omething of the ludicrou&#8747;, that &#8747;erve&#8747; to &#8747;hew in what manner they rea&#8747;oned with danger.</p>
<p>It may not be improper, in thi&#8747; place, to mention the medley of nation&#8747; who were &#8747;ettled in Britain, and who may be proved not to have entirely coale&#8747;ced, or been blended together in the&#8747;e part&#8747;, &#8747;o late a&#8747; the day&#8747; of Hubert the Vallibu&#8747; of Gil&#8747;land, from a deed of hi&#8747;, addre&#8747;&#8747;ed to all Cumbrian&#8747;, Frenchmen, Alien&#8747;, Dane&#8747;, and Norman&#8747;. Yet it doe&#8747; not &#8747;eem that any of the&#8747;e people brought a regular code of law&#8747; along with them; or if they did, the&#8747;e law&#8747; were either never received, or were &#8747;oon lo&#8747;t and &#8747;wallowed up in the prevalent humor: for we find after that, the Commi&#8747;&#8747;ioner&#8747; appointed to &#8747;ettle the peace of the Marche&#8747; by fixed and e&#8747;tabli&#8747;hed ordinance&#8747;, colle&#392;ting the&#8747;e ordinance&#8747; from the traditional account&#8747; of ancient u&#8747;age&#8747;, that had been &#8747;an&#392;tified a&#8747; law&#8747; by the length of time which they had endured. And a&#8747; the&#8747;e u&#8747;age&#8747; were different from mo&#8747;t other&#8747;, nay, almo&#8747;t peculiar to the men to whom they belonged, it i&#8747; natural to infer that the law&#8747; built upon them mu&#8747;t be &#8747;ingular: for the Commi&#8747;&#8747;ioner&#8747;, well aware of the impra&#392;ticability of impo&#8747;ing new law&#8747; upon &#8747;uch
<pb n="xvi"/>
people, contented them&#8747;elve&#8747; with endeavouring to re&#8747;train them, by giving authority to tho&#8747;e ordinance&#8747; by which they had endeavoured, from immemorial time&#8747;, though in vain, to regulate them&#8747;elve&#8747;. It mu&#8747;t be allowed, that &#8747;ince the mi&#8747;chief&#8747; could not be totally erazed by any regulation&#8747; of government, that &#8747;uch an e&#8747;tabli&#8747;hment of cu&#8747;tom&#8747; promi&#8747;ed a&#8747; fair for thi&#8747; purpo&#8747;e a&#8747; any thing: a&#8747; the cu&#8747;tom&#8747; were originally conformable to their own di&#8747;po&#8747;ition, perfe&#392;tly known to them, and more e&#8747;pecially a&#8747; from the foregoing circum&#8747;tance&#8747;. Men (to u&#8747;e one of Voltaire’&#8747; phra&#8747;e&#8747;,) could not in thi&#8747; ca&#8747;e be &#8747;aid to be made for law&#8747;, but law&#8747; for men. There re&#8747;t&#8747; yet, in the foregoing &#8747;entence&#8747;, and in the confirmation which they receive from hi&#8747;tory, a &#8747;trong and effe&#392;tual proof of what I formerly advanced, <i>viz.</i> that very little alteration had taken place in the&#8747;e part&#8747;, from very remote age&#8747; to time&#8747; immediately preceding Queen Elizabeth; and though, perhap&#8747;, no people altered very far during that period, yet I think thi&#8747; altered the lea&#8747;t of any, either in manner&#8747; or condition.</p>
<p>It &#8747;eem&#8747; natural, therefore, that toward&#8747; giving a more compleat notion of the people, I &#8747;hould give a &#8747;ummary account of &#8747;ome of their law&#8747;: they have been printed at large from &#8747;. Nichol&#8747;on’&#8747; manu&#8747;cript&#8747;, and therefore a full account of them i&#8747; neither a part of my bu&#8747;ine&#8747;&#8747;, nor an entire comment adapted to my limit&#8747;.</p>
<p>I &#8747;hall, however, begin with a law mentioned by Cambden. No one but a &#8747;cot&#8747;man could be admitted a&#8747; an evidence again&#8747;t a &#8747;cot&#8747;man, nor any one but an Engli&#8747;hman again&#8747;t an Engli&#8747;hman. Thi&#8747; wa&#8747; &#8747;urely a very fortunate law for thieve&#8747;, and more e&#8747;pecially for tho&#8747;e of the debateable ground; who, from their &#8747;ituation, could be of either nation, or of neither, a&#8747; they plea&#8747;ed. Thi&#8747; law, however, could only extend to particular matter&#8747;; &#8747;ince there i&#8747; another in Nichol&#8747;on’&#8747; colle&#392;tion, expre&#8747;&#8747;ly declaring, that no inhabitant of either kingdom, could, by mean&#8747; of witne&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;, prove hi&#8747; property in any thing po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ed by an inhabitant of the other; for &#8747;uch proof could only be made by the <i>body of a man</i>, that i&#8747; by combat; and &#8747;o numerou&#8747; were the cau&#8747;e&#8747; of litigation, that the&#8747;e combat&#8747; en&#8747;ued continually. The Marche&#8747;, moreover, were the place&#8747; where all &#8747;uch trial&#8747;, whether for murder or theft, were to take place between the inhabitant&#8747; of the two kingdom&#8747;; and no man accu&#8747;ed of the&#8747;e, or any other crime <i>that ought to be tried by &#8747;ingle combat</i>, wa&#8747; bound to an&#8747;wer for them el&#8747;ewhere. For thi&#8747; rea&#8747;on, there were particular place&#8747; fixed upon and &#8747;et apart for that purpo&#8747;e; and to tho&#8747;e place&#8747; might all men, betwixt Tolne&#8747;&#8747; in England and Caithne&#8747;&#8747; in &#8747;cotland, excepting the two King&#8747; and certain Bi&#8747;hop&#8747;, be &#8747;ummoned conformable to cu&#8747;tom, and required to decide their quarrel&#8747; by combat. I believe that the Borderer&#8747; had the good effe&#392;t&#8747; of thi&#8747; law almo&#8747;t entirely to them&#8747;elve&#8747;, nor do I remember to have heard or read of more than two in&#8747;tance&#8747; in which &#8747;tranger&#8747; availed them&#8747;elve&#8747; of it. Between the interior part&#8747; of the two kingdom&#8747; there wa&#8747; not much commerce of any kind; but the commerce of injurie&#8747; in particular could not extend far, e&#8747;pecially in time&#8747; of peace, for which only law&#8747; could be made; partly, becau&#8747;e the force employed in the petty infra&#392;tion&#8747; of quiet wa&#8747; not capable of a wide dire&#392;tion, and partly from the very nature of the incur&#8747;ion&#8747; them&#8747;elve&#8747;. There wa&#8747; a law al&#8747;o which regarded the flight of a va&#8747;&#8747;al into either kingdom, whereby, if demanded upon oath within &#8747;ix week&#8747;, he might be recovered by hi&#8747; lord, whether he had fled with or without hi&#8747; good&#8747;; but if the demand wa&#8747; made later than that time, the recovery of him wa&#8747; attended with greater difficulty. Debt&#8747; were to be recovered by an oath taken by the creditor in per&#8747;on upon the Marche&#8747;, nor were any allowed to make claim&#8747; of thi&#8747; kind by proxie&#8747; except the King&#8747; and Bi&#8747;hop&#8747; before mentioned. The law&#8747; which re&#8747;pe&#392;t the&#8747;e tran&#8747;a&#392;tion&#8747; are pretty &#8747;imilar to tho&#8747;e which took place in other part&#8747;; only, if a debtor of low rank could get other &#8747;ix per&#8747;on&#8747; to join with him in &#8747;wearing that he owed no &#8747;uch debt, he might be acquitted of it. But in matter&#8747; touching life and limb, and indeed in every claim, a per&#8747;onal attendance to pro&#8747;ecute the quarrel or cau&#8747;e by oath wa&#8747; required of every one but tho&#8747;e before excepted; and without thi&#8747;, unle&#8747;&#8747; a deputation wa&#8747; made by the con&#8747;ent of both partie&#8747;, a man’&#8747; plea wa&#8747; lo&#8747;t for ever. Tho’ the foregoing law did not contain much extraordinary matter, yet it&#8747; want of &#8747;ingularity i&#8747; fully compen&#8747;ated by one which immediately follow&#8747;: for it i&#8747; there declared,

that in every plea between a plaintiff and defendant that affe&#392;ted life and limb, that i&#8747;, which wa&#8747; to be decided by combat, if the defendant happened to die within the fifteen day&#8747; preceding the day of trial, hi&#8747; body &#8747;hould be carried to the Marche&#8747; at the time, and to the place appointed between the two partie&#8747;, becau&#8747;e no man can be <i>a&#8747;&#8747;oigned</i> by death. Again, When the appellant delayed hi&#8747; appearance beyond the appointed day, the defendant ought to pa&#8747;&#8747; to the Marche&#8747;, and obtain an atte&#8747;tation from three Baron&#8747; that he had regularly made hi&#8747; appearance on the day prefixed; and thi&#8747; being &#8747;igned by them, he wa&#8747; totally exempted from being liable to any challenge upon that &#8747;core for the future. He had al&#8747;o a right, if any, or all of tho&#8747;e Baron&#8747; to whom he made application &#8747;hould refu&#8747;e to give &#8747;uch a te&#8747;timony, to oblige even them to decide the matter by combat; and the &#8747;ame privilege extended al&#8747;o to the appellant. &#8747;tolen good&#8747; were, like debt&#8747;, demanded upon oath, and might be recovered, unle&#8747;&#8747; the per&#8747;on in who&#8747;e po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion they were found cho&#8747;e to deny it; the matter wa&#8747; then referred to the u&#8747;ual mode of deci&#8747;ion. With re&#8747;pe&#392;t to the i&#8747;&#8747;ue, or, to &#8747;peak more in the language of the time&#8747;, convi&#392;tion of the&#8747;e trial&#8747; by combat, it i&#8747; worthy of notice, that whether a per&#8747;on wa&#8747; found guilty, by thi&#8747; mean&#8747;, of theft, or robbery, or murder, hi&#8747; atonement wa&#8747; made by a forfeiture of good&#8747;, and he wa&#8747; obliged to find &#8747;uretie&#8747; for the completion of thi&#8747; atonement; in con&#8747;equence of which, there were particular law&#8747; re&#8747;pe&#392;ting the convi&#392;t, hi&#8747; &#8747;uretie&#8747;, and the pur&#8747;uer. An a&#8747;ylum wa&#8747;, among&#8747;t the other circum&#8747;tance&#8747; of the&#8747;e law&#8747;, allowed to any malefa&#392;tor who fled from one kingdom to the other: and when he pa&#8747;&#8747;ed from one di&#8747;tri&#392;t or province of the kingdom, in which he had taken refuge, he wa&#8747; entitled to protection upon an application to the &#8747;heriff of that di&#8747;tri&#392;t or province into which he entered: or if he could not find the &#8747;heriff, he might &#8747;till obtain peace and prote&#392;tion, by ringing the bell&#8747; of the fir&#8747;t church at which he arrived within &#8747;uch precin&#392;t&#8747;: but on the contrary, if he could be &#8747;eized by tho&#8747;e from whom he had e&#8747;caped before he performed what wa&#8747; by them called “obtaining peace," in thi&#8747; manner, he might be carried back without oppo&#8747;ition. Yet when a quarrel arrived at tho&#8747;e circum&#8747;tance&#8747;, in which it could only be decided by combat; that i&#8747;, when one per&#8747;on denied the claim of another, it might &#8747;till be evaded within the fifteen day&#8747;, which were generally allowed by ancient cu&#8747;tom, a&#8747; preparatory to &#8747;uch deci&#8747;ion: for it wa&#8747; provided, that if the per&#8747;on accu&#8747;ed &#8747;hould bring the animal, on account of which the litigation had ri&#8747;en, to the Marche&#8747; on the day appointed for the combat, and there inform the oppo&#8747;ite party that he believed that the property in que&#8747;tion belonged to that party, he wa&#8747; exempted from the nece&#8747;&#8747;ity of a combat; but wa&#8747; obliged to drive the animal into the Tweed or E&#8747;k; and if it wa&#8747; drowned before it reached the mid-&#8747;tream, he wa&#8747; &#8747;till an&#8747;werable for it. We know not how they managed thi&#8747; bu&#8747;ine&#8747;&#8747; when the matter of di&#8747;pute wa&#8747; &#8747;uch a&#8747; could neither wade nor &#8747;wim acro&#8747;&#8747;, for we find no in&#8747;titution regarding the re&#8747;toration on inanimate property.</p>
<p>It i&#8747; needle&#8747;&#8747; to make any further refle&#392;tion upon the&#8747;e law&#8747;, than what every one will make upon peru&#8747;ing them in the&#8747;e day&#8747; of regularity and peace, <i>viz.</i> What &#8747;uch mortal&#8747; mu&#8747;t they have been, among&#8747;t whom &#8747;uch cu&#8747;tom&#8747; had prevailed from immemorial time&#8747;, and for whom &#8747;uch law&#8747; were fabricated! However, from what it already &#8747;aid on thi&#8747; &#8747;ubje&#392;t, I think any per&#8747;on may form &#8747;ome idea of the men who formerly inhabited the di&#8747;tri&#392;t&#8747; comprehended in the&#8747;e plan&#8747;, and the part&#8747; contiguou&#8747;. To be more copiou&#8747; would, perhap&#8747;, be &#8747;uperfluou&#8747;, a&#8747; any reader of common attention may find abundant example&#8747; of their temper and manner of life in the hi&#8747;tory of the di&#8747;&#8747;en&#8747;ion&#8747; and war&#8747; between the Engli&#8747;h and &#8747;cot&#8747;. I only beg leave to mention here, that the land&#8747; were held by a &#8747;ort of military &#8747;ervice peculiar to their &#8747;ituation; that when the beacon&#8747; were fired, every man wa&#8747; to become a &#8747;oldier; and that the hornage, &#8747;ergeant’&#8747;-oat&#8747;, and a va&#8747;t number of other due&#8747;, rent&#8747;, and perqui&#8747;ite&#8747;, of an almo&#8747;t &#8747;ingular kind, are to thi&#8747; hour indubitable proof&#8747; of the unhappy condition of the&#8747;e countie&#8747; in former time&#8747;. I think al&#8747;o, that I have &#8747;aid enough toward&#8747; proving my original propo&#8747;ition&#8747; concerning the leading chara&#392;teri&#8747;tic&#8747; which marked the people of the Northern part&#8747; of England, and toward&#8747; demon&#8747;trating the effe&#392;t&#8747; of habitual infelicity, and a life never void of fear. I &#8747;hall therefore conclude thi&#8747; &#8747;ubje&#392;t

with two or three quotation&#8747; from Cambden, which &#8747;erve a&#8747; corollarie&#8747; to the preceding propo&#8747;ition, and which, being writ at a time when the &#8747;pirit, of mo&#8747;&#8747;-trooping wa&#8747; in full vigour, and by men who had &#8747;een it&#8747; effe&#392;t&#8747; them&#8747;elve&#8747;, not only carry intrin&#8747;ic credit along with them, but fully elucidate what I have been advancing.</p>
<p>In one place, Cambden &#8747;ay&#8747;, “ That the inhabitant&#8747; on both &#8747;ide&#8747;, a&#8747; Borderer&#8747; in all “ other part&#8747;, are a military kind of men; nimble, wily, alway&#8747; in readine&#8747;&#8747; for any “&#8747;ervice, and, by rea&#8747;on of their often &#8747;kirmi&#8747;he&#8747; pa&#8747;&#8747;ing, well experienced."</p>
<p>In another place i&#8747; a pa&#8747;&#8747;age which confirm&#8747; my original &#8747;uppo&#8747;ition, that very little alteration of circum&#8747;tance&#8747;, and con&#8747;equently of tho&#8747;e manner&#8747; which are influence&#8747; by them, had taken place in the Border&#8747; for many age&#8747;. For we are there told, that “ in the time of the Roman&#8747;, their &#8747;oldier&#8747;, (who were principally levied in Britain,) were “&#8747;tationed in the frontier ca&#8747;tle&#8747; and citie&#8747; of the Northern Province&#8747;; and when there “ wa&#8747; any fear of plunder or wa&#8747;te from the neighbouring nation&#8747;, had field-&#8747;tation&#8747; in “ the barbarian ground for the defence of the Province; other&#8747; made outrode&#8747; into “ the enemy’&#8747; Marche&#8747;, to di&#8747;cover their motion&#8747;, and if good occa&#8747;ion offered, to encounter “ with them before they came to their limit&#8747;."</p>

<p>&#8747;peaking of the Ottaduni, Cambden &#8747;ay&#8747;, ‘ That which &#230;nea&#8747; &#8747;ylviu&#8747;, afterward&#8747; ‘ Pope Piu&#8747; II. hath, when a private per&#8747;on, and amba&#8747;&#8747;ador to &#8747;cotland, under the ‘ name of John Gebelli, reported of the Borderer&#8747;, I think good to relate, con&#8747;idering ‘ that a&#8747; yet they have not at all degenerated.’ From thi&#8747; account, that I may avoid tran&#8747;cribing the whole, it appear&#8747;, that in the year 1448, wherein he performed thi&#8747; emba&#8747;&#8747;y, that the principal &#8747;ub&#8747;i&#8747;tence of the Borderer&#8747; wa&#8747; on hen&#8747;, gee&#8747;e, and variou&#8747; &#8747;ort&#8747; of gruel&#8747;, and pottage, but were utterly unacquainted with white bread or wine. Thi&#8747; circum&#8747;tance prove&#8747; their commerce mu&#8747;t have been very little, or none at all, and their agriculture in a very poor condition. Indeed, who would till the ground, when it wa&#8747; &#8747;o uncertain who &#8747;hould reap, or perhap&#8747; burn the crop? We do not find that they wanted ho&#8747;pitality, though it wa&#8747; probably like that of the Arabian, who would perhap&#8747; fea&#8747;t you in hi&#8747; hou&#8747;e to-day, and rob you in the de&#8747;art to-morrow. When &#230;nea&#8747; arrived at a large village, the name of which he doe&#8747; not mention, the inhabitant&#8747; of it, men, women, and children, came running about him, to gape and &#8747;tare at him a&#8747; at a &#8747;trange &#8747;ight, or the appearance of a “ blackamore, or a man of India." Having been informed of the &#8747;carcity prevailing in tho&#8747;e di&#8747;tri&#392;t&#8747;, he had received at a certain Abbey &#8747;ome loave&#8747; of white bread, and a rundlet of red wine, which to the&#8747;e attendant&#8747; of hi&#8747;, for they had followed him to the hou&#8747;e where he &#8747;upped, inquiring of their prie&#8747;t whether he wa&#8747; a chri&#8747;tian or not, were matter&#8747; of greater a&#8747;toni&#8747;hment than him&#8747;elf, having never till that time &#8747;een any thing of the kind: “ There approached the table,

“&#8747;ay&#8747; he, great-bellied women, and their hu&#8747;band&#8747;, who handling the bread, and &#8747;melling “ the wine, craved &#8747;ome part thereof; and there wa&#8747; no remedy, but to divide and “ give it all away among&#8747;t them." However, two hour&#8747; within night they all (<i>i.e.</i> the male&#8747;,) left &#230;nea&#8747; to him&#8747;elf, and repaired with all po&#8747;&#8747;ible &#8747;peed, for fear of the &#8747;cot&#8747;, to a &#8747;trong place at a good di&#8747;tance, leaving the women behind, and refu&#8747;ing to accept of &#230;nea&#8747;’&#8747; company; for it &#8747;eem&#8747; the &#8747;cot&#8747; u&#8747;ed at low water to pa&#8747;&#8747; over the river, and fall to <i>boot-haling</i>. With re&#8747;pe&#392;t to their ravenou&#8747; method of begging mentioned above, I cannot help comparing it to that of the Haiduk&#8747;, who lead a &#8747;avage and mi&#8747;erable life among&#8747;t the mountain&#8747; of Dalmatia, and are &#8747;ometime&#8747; compelled by hunger to come down among&#8747;t the Morlacchi of the lower country, with manner&#8747; &#8747;imilar to tho&#8747;e of our Borderer&#8747;: whil&#8747;t their re&#8747;orting to place&#8747; of defence, and leaving their own habitation&#8747; in time&#8747; of danger, bear&#8747; a &#8747;trong re&#8747;emblance to the pra&#392;tice of the back-&#8747;ettler&#8747; in America, who being, like the&#8747;e, rendered half-&#8747;avage&#8747; by &#8747;ituation, and expo&#8747;ed to unfore&#8747;een inroad&#8747;, are nece&#8747;&#8747;itated to &#8747;imilar re&#8747;ource&#8747;, when they are threatened with an Indian war; only there i&#8747; thi&#8747; di&#8747;tin&#392;tion, the Engli&#8747;h &#8747;avage&#8747; in America &#8747;helter their wive&#8747; along with them&#8747;elve&#8747;, but the Engli&#8747;h &#8747;avage&#8747; on the border&#8747; of &#8747;cotland refu&#8747;ed any &#8747;uch allowance to their&#8747;; “being," a&#8747; &#230;nea&#8747; tell&#8747; u&#8747;, “ thoroughly per&#8747;waded that the enemie&#8747; will do them no hurt, a&#8747; who reckon whoredom “ no hurt or evil at all." To have done with thi&#8747; account given by &#230;nea&#8747;, it appear&#8747;, particularly from the remaining part of it, that they &#8747;pent their day&#8747; in anxiety, and their night&#8747; without re&#8747;t: that, ingro&#8747;&#8747;ed with more immediate care&#8747;, they had no idea&#8747; of any kind of improvement or elegance: that their furniture, employment, accommodation&#8747;, and dre&#8747;&#8747;, bore inconte&#8747;tible mark&#8747; of the fir&#8747;t and rude&#8747;t &#8747;tage&#8747; of &#8747;ociety; and that the condition of their women, even making allowance for the effe&#392;t&#8747; of habit, mu&#8747;t have been particularly unhappy; &#8747;ince, independent of the danger to which they were expo&#8747;ed, and of the continual alarm&#8747; in which they lived, on account of their &#8747;ituation, they were treated &#8747;o gro&#8747;&#8747;ly, and negle&#392;ted &#8747;o &#8747;hamefully by the men, a&#8747; to be refu&#8747;ed the &#8747;ame &#8747;helter and defence with them&#8747;elve&#8747;; experiencing in thi&#8747;, that u&#8747;age which, a&#8747; it i&#8747; the con&#8747;tant companion, i&#8747; held by all writer&#8747; to be a &#8747;ure &#8747;ign of the compleate&#8747;t &#8747;tate of barbari&#8747;m. What a change ha&#8747; a &#8747;pace of time le&#8747;&#8747; than two centurie&#8747; produced!</p>
<p>Having &#8747;o far &#8747;ketched the outline of tho&#8747;e chara&#392;ter&#8747; from whom we the inhabitant&#8747; of the middle of Britain are immediately derived, I think it will be no hard matter for any one to refer, according to the tenor of my &#8747;econd propo&#8747;ition, their private humour&#8747; a&#8747; individual&#8747;, to their publick exploit&#8747; a&#8747; a body, and to &#8747;ee in their deed&#8747; the habit&#8747; and prepo&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747; of their mind&#8747;.</p>
<p>III. With re&#8747;pe&#392;t to cu&#8747;tom&#8747;, (the &#8747;ubje&#392;t of the third paragraph,) I &#8747;hall, after offering two or three ob&#8747;ervation&#8747;, proceed to relate a few of tho&#8747;e which obtain a&#8747; yet a place in the north of England, and either bear an analogy to &#8747;ome that have belonged to different time&#8747; and place&#8747;, or a&#8747; yet pre&#8747;erve ve&#8747;tige&#8747; of the former &#8747;tate of the country.</p>
<p>Cu&#8747;tom&#8747; may be con&#8747;idered a&#8747; of two kind&#8747;, natural and adventitiou&#8747;. To the fir&#8747;t cla&#8747;&#8747; may be referred tho&#8747;e which, ari&#8747;ing from climate, chara&#392;teri&#8747;tic nation&#8747; at large with a great degree of uniformity; a&#8747; well a&#8747; tho&#8747;e which, being common to mankind in general, belong not to my purpo&#8747;e: it i&#8747; from the latter cla&#8747;&#8747;, which, being introduced into and kept alive by circum&#8747;tance&#8747;, I have called Adventitiou&#8747;, that the main body of ob&#8747;ervation&#8747; which occur to the traveller are furni&#8747;hed. It i&#8747; from hence, that every now and then we find re&#8747;emblance&#8747; between tho&#8747;e of different countrie&#8747;, that are apt to &#8747;urpri&#8747;e at fir&#8747;t &#8747;ight, or &#8747;tumble upon &#8747;ingularitie&#8747; for which we know not how to account; but I believe we may &#8747;afely refer all &#8747;uch re&#8747;emblance&#8747; to &#8747;imilarity of circum&#8747;tance&#8747;, either prevailing now or at &#8747;ome former period, or otherwi&#8747;e, a&#8747; I &#8747;aid before, to unrecorded intercour&#8747;e; whil&#8747;t &#8747;ingularitie&#8747; generally may, upon examination, be traced to &#8747;ome of tho&#8747;e unfore&#8747;een accident&#8747; which have alway&#8747; wandered at large in the world, and have often been of &#8747;uch con&#8747;equence in particular

place&#8747;, a&#8747; to cau&#8747;e them&#8747;elve&#8747; to be remembered in &#8747;ome cu&#8747;tom or other: when, therefore, cu&#8747;tom&#8747; in one country and age bear a re&#8747;emblance to tho&#8747;e of other region&#8747; and time&#8747;, or are an elucidation of &#8747;ome &#8747;ingularity of chara&#392;ter, they lie immediately in the way of hi&#8747;tory, and are thing&#8747; of &#8747;ome value.</p>
<p>I &#8747;hall proceed to relate a few of the&#8747;e, and begin fir&#8747;t with the mode of building their town&#8747; and village&#8747;. The&#8747;e were, from very obviou&#8747; rea&#8747;on&#8747; which have been already alluded to, either built upon a hill, or in the neighbourhood, or even immediately under the &#8747;helter of &#8747;ome &#8747;trong place. &#8747;uch &#8747;ituation&#8747; were more particularly nece&#8747;&#8747;ary in the north of England than el&#8747;ewhere; &#8747;ince, when elevated, they commanded a wider pro&#8747;pe&#392;t, and afforded a readier information of the approach of tho&#8747;e enemie&#8747; whom they were daily afraid of; or, when in the neighbourhood of a &#8747;trong place, they enjoyed from thence a prote&#392;tion when the enemie&#8747; were really come. The fir&#8747;t &#8747;ort &#8747;till retain the name&#8747; of the hill&#8747; on which they were built; and the latter, with the addition of <i>by</i>, tho&#8747;e of the per&#8747;on&#8747; or familie&#8747; who were po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;or&#8747; of the &#8747;trong place&#8747; to which they were contiguou&#8747;.

<p>There are many other circum&#8747;tance&#8747; which regard the &#8747;ituation&#8747; of town&#8747; in the&#8747;e part&#8747;; but a&#8747; they originate in a good mea&#8747;ure from the nature of the &#8747;oil, I &#8747;hall defer meddling with them until I come to &#8747;peak of that &#8747;ubje&#392;t. I cannot, however, pa&#8747;&#8747; over the method of building each particular hou&#8747;e, e&#8747;pecially a&#8747; it i&#8747; &#8747;omewhat &#8747;ingular, and begin&#8747; of late to be di&#8747;u&#8747;ed. From the front-door an entry run&#8747; clo&#8747;e behind the fire-place of the better kitchen, dire&#392;tly acro&#8747;&#8747; the building, to the back-door, which open&#8747; into a yard where the byre&#8747; and &#8747;table&#8747; generally are. On one &#8747;ide of thi&#8747; entry i&#8747; the door leading into the down-hou&#8747;e or kitchen, where they brew, bake, <i>&#38;c.</i>; on the other &#8747;ide of the entry i&#8747; the pa&#8747;&#8747;age into the hou&#8747;e it&#8747;elf, for &#8747;o the better kitchen i&#8747; called; but thi&#8747; pa&#8747;&#8747;age i&#8747; clo&#8747;e to the back-door, &#8747;o that before you arrive at the fire you have almo&#8747;t gone round it. The variou&#8747; part&#8747; and door&#8747; of thi&#8747; entrance into the hou&#8747;e are known by the name&#8747; of Hallen, Heck, and Mill-door&#8747;, or the &#8747;pace between the door&#8747;. Oppo&#8747;ite to the fire-place i&#8747; the door of the chamber, or, a&#8747; it i&#8747; called in it&#8747; genuine Engli&#8747;h name, of the Bower, where the ma&#8747;ter and mi&#8747;tre&#8747;&#8747; of the family &#8747;leep.

The&#8747;e are a few of the change&#8747; which have been introduced of late day&#8747; into the cu&#8747;tom of building hou&#8747;e&#8747; in Cumberland and the neighbouring part&#8747; within a few year&#8747; pa&#8747;t; and though I am willing to believe that modern fa&#8747;hion&#8747; may have give more elegance to building&#8747;, yet I am far from thinking that they have provided better in general for excluding either the wintry wind&#8747;, or the heat&#8747; of &#8747;ummer. Thi&#8747; obje&#392;tion, however, to modern improvement&#8747;, will not hold in the compari&#8747;on of the old chimney&#8747; with tho&#8747;e that are now u&#8747;ed: the balk, the randle-tree, the black-hood, and the &#8747;loothing, have little to boa&#8747;t of, but their &#8747;uperior utility in drying winter provi&#8747;ion&#8747;.

<p>I beg leave al&#8747;o to refer to thi&#8747; head, that very natural and very general cu&#8747;tom in all language&#8747;, of tran&#8747;ferring the name of one obje&#392;t to another which re&#8747;embled it; or where the thing&#8747; them&#8747;elve&#8747; were not alike, yet if the &#8747;en&#8747;ation&#8747; which they excited were &#8747;imilar, their name&#8747; have generally been &#8747;o, and they who fir&#8747;t impo&#8747;ed &#8747;eem to have appealed to their feeling&#8747; in doing &#8747;o. The application of thi&#8747; to the pre&#8747;ent &#8747;ubje&#392;t may be a&#8747; follow&#8747;: A &#8747;harp-pointed hill wa&#8747; in Cumberland called a <i>Cop</i>, which, according to Cambden, i&#8747; a very old word; hence a conical piece of butter, (a very common thing, e&#8747;pecially in the mountainou&#8747; part&#8747;,) or of any thing el&#8747;e, hath the &#8747;ame title; and a little &#8747;tool, the top and diverging feet of which re&#8747;emble a truncated cone, hath the diminutive name of <i>Coppy</i>: hence too, perhap&#8747;, the word&#8747; cop&#8747;e and coppice, with &#8747;everal other&#8747;, might be derived. A bright flame i&#8747; in &#8747;everal diale&#392;t&#8747; called a <i>Low</i>; and a certain di&#8747;order of the finger&#8747;, from it&#8747; colour&#8747;, and the nature of it&#8747; pain, i&#8747; called a <i>Whitlow</i>; much in the &#8747;ame manner a&#8747; the Greek&#8747; from fire gave name to a <i>Fever</i>, and the Latin&#8747; to <i>Inflammation</i>. &#8747;uch re&#8747;emblance&#8747; are, however, &#8747;ometime&#8747; urged further, a&#8747; &#8747;hall be noticed more at large hereafter: at pre&#8747;ent, it may &#8747;uffice to ob&#8747;erve, that when the motion of a top i&#8747; imperceptible, it i&#8747; &#8747;aid to &#8747;leep; hence the phra&#8747;e “ a&#8747; &#8747;ound a&#8747; a top;" and a&#8747; top&#8747; were made of horn, hence that vulgar one of “&#8747;leeping “ horn-hard." It may be well enough to compare the&#8747;e with that derivation which the Greek&#8747; made from the &#8747;ame word, e&#8747;pecially a&#8747; the difference of circum&#8747;tance&#8747; have rendered them &#8747;o very remote from one another; after deriving their name of a Horn from that which &#8747;ignified the head, they applied, according to Eu&#8747;tathiu&#8747;, the verb immediately deduced from thence to the mixing of the liquor&#8747; which they drunk; becau&#8747;e their drinking-ve&#8747;&#8747;el&#8747;, a&#8747; i&#8747; the ca&#8747;e in many place&#8747; at thi&#8747; day, were mo&#8747;tly of &#8747;uch material&#8747;, and from thence gave a name to every kind of goblet; &#8747;omewhat in the &#8747;ame manner a&#8747; we give to any ve&#8747;&#8747;el that contain&#8747; ink for immediate u&#8747;e, of whatever kind of &#8747;ub&#8747;tance it may be, the name of Ink-horn.</p>

For in the trouble&#8747;ome time&#8747;, of which I made mention in the foregoing paragraph&#8747;, and which I &#8747;hall have occa&#8747;ion to mention again, &#8747;ome tenant&#8747; held their land&#8747; by furni&#8747;hing a man and a hor&#8747;e, other&#8747; by furni&#8747;hing a footman whil&#8747;t the lord furni&#8747;hed a hor&#8747;eman; other hamlet&#8747; by furni&#8747;hing a certain number of bowmen, and other&#8747; by every individual who held land&#8747; appearing in arm&#8747; when an inva&#8747;ion from the &#8747;cotti&#8747;h Marche&#8747; wa&#8747; expe&#392;ted. It i&#8747; true that the proportion&#8747; were regulated by contingencie&#8747;, or by the Lord Warden; but they have now &#8747;ettled into a &#8747;ort of uniformity, under which, though little noted in general, they are &#8747;till &#8747;omewhat retentive of their original di&#8747;tin&#392;tion, and have now and then given birth to law &#8747;uit&#8747;, which the able&#8747;t lawyer&#8747;, con&#8747;ciou&#8747; of their intricacy, have thought proper to decide by making the antiquity of u&#8747;age their &#8747;tandard, and by endeavouring to balance the apparent authority of one cu&#8747;tom with that of &#8747;uch a&#8747; might be alledged on a contrary &#8747;ide. The uncertainty of the be&#8747;t inve&#8747;tigation of matter&#8747; of thi&#8747; nature, and the chicane to which they mu&#8747;t give birth, need not be adverted to: the different claim&#8747; which the Prince&#8747; of Germany could produce upon one another, and which they have occa&#8747;ionally produced, are example&#8747; of it, though upon an infinitely larger &#8747;cale; and though &#8747;uch intricacie&#8747; are common enough in many part&#8747; of England, yet their frequency in the Norhtern part&#8747; &#8747;trengthen&#8747; the belief, that the ma&#8747;ter&#8747; and owner&#8747; of land&#8747; have in former time&#8747; been le&#8747;&#8747; &#8747;ubje&#392;t to the uniform controul of civil law than they were generally in other part&#8747; which lay further to the &#8747;outh: I mu&#8747;t indeed acknowledge, that a circum&#8747;tance of thi&#8747; &#8747;ort hardly need&#8747; &#8747;uch an argument. With re&#8747;pe&#392;t to tho&#8747;e other tribute&#8747; to the Lord&#8747;, which were u&#8747;ual in every place, they belong not &#8747;o far to me a&#8747; that I &#8747;hould be particular about them; for being generally known to men of the law, and better than they are to me, I &#8747;hall only mention &#8747;uch a&#8747; are particular when I come to the place&#8747; to which &#8747;uch particular tribute&#8747; belong. That of the be&#8747;t bed and the be&#8747;t hor&#8747;e paid on the decea&#8747;e of any per&#8747;on, of the boon-day&#8747;, and many more, are not &#8747;o unu&#8747;ual a&#8747; to claim a place here.</p>  
<p>To a per&#8747;on who ha&#8747; been told, and that with great truth, that there i&#8747; hardly a pea&#8747;ant at thi&#8747; time in the&#8747;e countie&#8747; who cannot at lea&#8747;t read and write, it may &#8747;eem &#8747;trange, that, not very long ago, the ca&#8747;e wa&#8747; &#8747;o far different, that in a certain village the poor-rate&#8747; were colle&#392;ted by mean&#8747; of a notched &#8747;tick; every notch in which repre&#8747;ented a tenement, and the proportion which each wa&#8747; to pay wa&#8747; known by &#8747;imilar mean&#8747;: thi&#8747; &#8747;tick i&#8747; &#8747;till pre&#8747;erved, and ha&#8747; not been &#8747;o long laid a&#8747;ide but that there are per&#8747;on&#8747; &#8747;till alive who can, to u&#8747;e their own phra&#8747;e, <i>read it</i>. There i&#8747; al&#8747;o another village in which tho&#8747;e rate&#8747; were never yet colle&#392;ted at all, and where the cu&#8747;tom of providing for their poor, which &#8747;ub&#8747;i&#8747;ted long before the law&#8747; re&#8747;pe&#392;ting that &#8747;ubje&#392;t, i&#8747; &#8747;till continued; and it&#8747; particular&#8747;, which are curiou&#8747; enough, are known and ob&#8747;erved with the greate&#8747;t exa&#392;tne&#8747;&#8747;, both by the pauper&#8747; and the other inhabitant&#8747;.</p>
<p>Cultivation of every kind ha&#8747; al&#8747;o undergone a very great change within a few year&#8747;; and thi&#8747; change, originating partly from the improvement of the road&#8747;, and partly from the &#8747;pirit of indu&#8747;try, diffu&#8747;ed by the taking-up and divi&#8747;ion of a great number of common&#8747;, ha&#8747; had a &#8747;urpri&#8747;ing effe&#392;t on the manner&#8747; of the people; an effe&#392;t which a man need not have lived or made ob&#8747;ervation&#8747; for any great length of time to be &#8747;en&#8747;ible of. Thu&#8747;, though the harve&#8747;t-cry, and the rural fea&#8747;t&#8747; and cu&#8747;tom&#8747; are &#8747;till pre&#8747;erved, and though a boundary-&#8747;tone i&#8747; on &#8747;ome occa&#8747;ion&#8747; &#8747;till &#8747;acred, yet the number of hedge&#8747; i&#8747; mightily increa&#8747;ed, and con&#8747;equently the nece&#8747;&#8747;ity of them in

a great mea&#8747;ure &#8747;uper&#8747;eded: and I know not that there can be a more remarkable pa&#8747;&#8747;age in the hi&#8747;tory of rural civilization, than the &#8747;ub&#8747;titution of hedge&#8747; in the place of the rude <i>mete&#8747;</i> and <i>boundarie&#8747;</i> &#8747;o generally u&#8747;ed in former time&#8747;; and thu&#8747; rendering the watcher&#8747; of cattle needle&#8747;&#8747;, a&#8747; well a&#8747; giving beauty to the country it&#8747;elf. I doubt not but there have been almo&#8747;t alway&#8747; hedge&#8747; in &#8747;ome place&#8747;, and indeed there are many remaining that bear the mark&#8747; of great antiquity, but the neatne&#8747;&#8747; and beauty of them i&#8747; a very modern improvement at lea&#8747;t in the&#8747;e part&#8747;. There are, be&#8747;ide&#8747;, many other circum&#8747;tance&#8747; which &#8747;erve to prove, that agriculture, in the beginning of the pre&#8747;ent age, wore a &#8747;ort of face which it had pre&#8747;erved without any material alteration in the North of England for &#8747;ome centurie&#8747;. Among&#8747;t the circum&#8747;tance&#8747; which led to thi&#8747; change, I &#8747;hould a&#392;t very unfairly if I did not mention the introdu&#392;tion of potatoe&#8747;, a&#8747; of a food that ha&#8747; &#8747;uper&#8747;eded the old-fa&#8747;hioned di&#8747;he&#8747; (&#8747;uch almo&#8747;t a&#8747; &#230;nea&#8747; &#8747;ylviu&#8747; met with on the border&#8747;) &#8747;o entirely a&#8747; in a manner to render their name&#8747;, and the manner in which they were cooked, ob&#8747;olete, even in &#8747;o &#8747;hort a &#8747;pace of time a&#8747; that of fifty or &#8747;ixty year&#8747;.</p>
<p>Waving a great number of thing&#8747; relative to thi&#8747; &#8747;ubje&#392;t, becau&#8747;e there may be found in every place cu&#8747;tom&#8747; &#8747;ufficient to fill a volume, I &#8747;hall ju&#8747;t mention one or two which are generally known, though their origin i&#8747; not much attended to, nor perhap&#8747; can be ever known with certainty: That of ble&#8747;&#8747;ing a per&#8747;on who &#8747;neeze&#8747; would almo&#8747;t &#8747;eem, from that pa&#8747;&#8747;age in Homer where Penelope addre&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747; Telemachu&#8747; upon &#8747;uch an occa&#8747;ion, to be of Gr&#230;cian origin; though tradition &#8747;ay&#8747; that it aro&#8747;e during a plague which commonly began with &#8747;neezing, and wa&#8747; a mode of wi&#8747;hing that thi&#8747; might not be a forerunner of the malady. The virtue of uneven number&#8747; plainly &#8747;prung up in the medical world; and indeed the phra&#8747;e&#8747; that &#8747;till remain in &#8747;o many countrie&#8747; re&#8747;pe&#392;ting them, however rude and vulgar, refer obviou&#8747;ly to the empiric &#8747;uper&#8747;tition from whence they originated. Religion ha&#8747; given birth to far more trifle&#8747;, which are &#8747;till alive, than any thing el&#8747;e, though they are at thi&#8747; day matter&#8747; of &#8747;port; nor will an one who con&#8747;ider&#8747; the geniu&#8747; of former time&#8747; be hard to per&#8747;wade, that even &#8747;t Agne&#8747;’&#8747; Fa&#8747;t, the efficacy of bride-cake on dream&#8747;, the ceremony of to&#8747;&#8747;ing a &#8747;tocking in the bed-chamber of a newly-married couple, and twenty other mode&#8747; of progno&#8747;tication belonging to the young, and &#8747;till more belonging to the aged, were in former time&#8747; of &#8747;ome importance, e&#8747;pecially when he i&#8747; told that there are &#8747;ome &#8747;illy mind&#8747; that repo&#8747;e a confidence in them yet: and indeed if we make a reference to time&#8747; and prejudice&#8747;, why may not the meeting of the flame&#8747; of two nut&#8747; thrown into the fire, each of which i&#8747; &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed to repre&#8747;ent a per&#8747;on, a&#8747; fairly betoken the union of tho&#8747;e per&#8747;on&#8747;, a&#8747; the parting of the flame that aro&#8747;e from the funeral pyre of Eteocle&#8747; and Polynice&#8747; betokened the hatred of tho&#8747;e brother&#8747;? The method of divination among&#8747;t the ancient German&#8747;, a&#8747; we find it in Tacitu&#8747;, wa&#8747; by no mean&#8747; more complex, and not a little re&#8747;embled thi&#8747;, a&#8747; well in the few circum&#8747;tance&#8747; belonging to each, a&#8747; in their common &#8747;implicity.</p>
<p>Having thu&#8747; made mention of Tacitu&#8747;, it occur&#8747; to me to take notice, by mean&#8747; of hi&#8747; information, of a few thing&#8747; more which &#8747;hew the effe&#392;t that &#8747;imilarity of circum&#8747;tance&#8747; ha&#8747; on the manner&#8747; of di&#8747;tant nation&#8747;. The German&#8747;, like the Borderer&#8747; of whom I have been &#8747;peaking, made atonement for blood by mean&#8747; of cattle: Like all the inhabitant&#8747; of the more &#8747;olitary place&#8747;, even though robber&#8747;, &#8747;uch a&#8747; the Arab&#8747; and Mo&#8747;&#8747;-Trooper&#8747;, they thought it infamou&#8747; to deny the rite&#8747; of ho&#8747;pitality to any man of whatever nation: The borderer&#8747;, a&#8747; well a&#8747; the German&#8747;, went armed to every kind of bu&#8747;ine&#8747;&#8747;, and even to their fea&#8747;t&#8747;; and in the &#8747;ame manner their quarrel&#8747; were generally terminated by blood&#8747;hed in&#8747;tead of abu&#8747;ive language. Ale al&#8747;o wa&#8747; the beverage of the German&#8747;, a&#8747; it i&#8747; now and ha&#8747; long been of the Engli&#8747;h; But the mo&#8747;t remarkable re&#8747;emblance now left i&#8747; that of the &#8747;port which Tacitu&#8747; de&#8747;cribe&#8747; a&#8747; the only one with which the German&#8747; were acquainted, and of which a corre&#392;t copy, a&#8747; far a&#8747; we can judge, may be &#8747;een in the <i>&#8747;word-dance</i> that i&#8747; &#8747;till in vogue in &#8747;ome place&#8747; contiguou&#8747; to the Border&#8747;. Ha&#8747; it been pre&#8747;erved by imitation, or revived by chance? The funeral howl ha&#8747; been rai&#8747;ed in mo&#8747;t part&#8747; of the world by the heroe&#8747; of Homer and Virgil, a&#8747; well a&#8747; by the women of Germany and Ireland. That animation which the German&#8747; derived, and that omen which they drew from the force and echo of their

Applicable to thi&#8747; &#8747;ubje&#392;t, and to the uniformity of manner&#8747; from uniformity of circum&#8747;tance&#8747;, i&#8747;, that robbery i&#8747; not con&#8747;idered a&#8747; &#8747;hameful among&#8747;t the Arab&#8747;; nor wa&#8747; it, a&#8747; we learn from the old poet&#8747;, among&#8747;t the Greek&#8747; in more remote time&#8747;, nor, a&#8747; hi&#8747;tory uniformly tell&#8747; u&#8747;, among&#8747;t the Borderer&#8747;. In addition to hi&#8747;tory, tradition, among&#8747;t other thing&#8747;, tell&#8747;, “ that a woman had two &#8747;on&#8747;; a&#8747; long a&#8747; her provi&#8747;ion&#8747; “ la&#8747;ted, &#8747;he &#8747;et them regularly on the table; but a&#8747; &#8747;oon a&#8747; they were fini&#8747;hed, &#8747;he “ brought them forth two &#8747;word&#8747;, which &#8747;he placed upon the table, and &#8747;aid, &#8747;on&#8747;, I “ have no meat for you, go &#8747;eek your dinner." &#8747;o familiar a thing wa&#8747; rapine!</p>
<p>When I &#8747;aid el&#8747;ewhere that &#8747;olitude pre&#8747;erved language from change, I might have added Cu&#8747;tom&#8747; al&#8747;o: Among&#8747;t the many living example&#8747; of thi&#8747;, I need in&#8747;tance none but that of the celebration of Chri&#8747;tma&#8747;. In proportion a&#8747; you advance into the more lonely and mountainou&#8747; di&#8747;tri&#392;t&#8747;, &#8747;o much the more i&#8747; the ancient fa&#8747;hion of that fe&#8747;tival perfe&#392;t; the number&#8747; of pie&#8747;, and of the rural attendant&#8747; on conviviality increa&#8747;ed; the <i>wait&#8747;</i> with their fiddle&#8747; pa&#8747;&#8747; from village to village; and the winter <i>merry-night&#8747;</i> (a&#8747; they are called,) &#8747;upply the want of the wake&#8747;, which are common (at other &#8747;ea&#8747;on&#8747; indeed,) in the more &#8747;outhern countie&#8747;.</p>
<p>Thu&#8747; have I endeavoured to give an idea of tho&#8747;e cu&#8747;tom&#8747; among&#8747;t which I wa&#8747; educated, and of &#8747;ome far older than the pre&#8747;ent age of men. I am apprehen&#8747;ive that I &#8747;hall be accu&#8747;ed of having de&#8747;cended to trifle&#8747; unworthy of notice: Let it be remembered, however, that great thing&#8747; have their conne&#392;tion with, if not often their birth from trifle&#8747;, and that rea&#8747;oning find&#8747; a fund of analogie&#8747; in unimportant obje&#392;t&#8747;. I will however frankly confe&#8747;&#8747;, that I have mentioned &#8747;everal cu&#8747;tom&#8747; which are not peculiar to the&#8747;e countie&#8747;, that I have omitted &#8747;everal that are &#8747;o, and that the whole i&#8747; in an indige&#8747;ted &#8747;tate. My excu&#8747;e for the fir&#8747;t i&#8747;, that I wi&#8747;hed, by compari&#8747;on&#8747; of thing&#8747; that could not be called peculiar, to prompt other&#8747; to a more ample inve&#8747;tigation of &#8747;o entertaining a &#8747;ubje&#392;t, a&#8747; that of re&#8747;emblance of manner&#8747; in different countrie&#8747;, and to attempt the inve&#8747;tigation of it&#8747; cau&#8747;e&#8747; from hi&#8747;tory, either general or particular. With regard to the &#8747;econd, I only &#8747;ay, that the bound&#8747; of an Introdu&#392;tion did not corre&#8747;pond with it, and that tho&#8747;e peculiaritie&#8747; will be found more at large in the hi&#8747;tory of the place&#8747; to which they belong. My apology for the third i&#8747;, that I wa&#8747; not writing a regular E&#8747;&#8747;ay, but throwing out a few hint&#8747;, which alluded to a part of the de&#8747;ign of the following Work.</p>
<p>IV. I come now to my fourth paragraph, or to that which re&#8747;pe&#392;t&#8747; the diale&#392;t&#8747; of the&#8747;e part&#8747;. In a &#8747;ubje&#392;t which open&#8747; &#8747;o wide a field a&#8747; thi&#8747; doe&#8747;, it cannot well be expe&#392;ted; but even though I touch upon it&#8747; particular part&#8747; in a very &#8747;light manner, I mu&#8747;t occa&#8747;ionally meddle, according to my general plan, with thing&#8747; that are not merely con&#8747;ined to it. There need&#8747; nothing el&#8747;e to prove how negligent an e&#8747;tabli&#8747;hed language i&#8747; of it&#8747; original term&#8747;, than an examination of numberle&#8747;&#8747; word&#8747; in the Engli&#8747;h tongue, and examining their derivation and compo&#8747;ition. &#8747;uch an examination will be mo&#8747;t ea&#8747;ily performed by con&#8747;ulting the work&#8747; of Lexicographer&#8747;, and then ob&#8747;erving how ob&#8747;olete the original or component part&#8747; of many common word&#8747; are become. Neither will any one, conver&#8747;ant in hi&#8747;tory, be at a lo&#8747;&#8747; in accounting for the relick&#8747; of variou&#8747; language&#8747; intermingled with our&#8747;: The word&#8747; compounded of Latin prepo&#8747;ition&#8747;, and &#8747;axon or French verb&#8747; and &#8747;ub&#8747;tantive&#8747;, are a living in&#8747;tance of the heterogeneou&#8747; mixture. &#8747;uch thing&#8747; I therefore pa&#8747;&#8747; by: but when I &#8747;aid that it wa&#8747; perhap&#8747; not unworthy of a thinking mind to ob&#8747;erve how word&#8747; exiled from one language &#8747;till retain their original &#8747;ignification in another of a kindred &#8747;tock, I meant to be a little more particular. For if Dutch and Engli&#8747;h word&#8747; were found by Bu&#8747;bequiu&#8747;, Amba&#8747;&#8747;ador from the Emperor to the Ottoman Court in Taurica Cher&#8747;one&#8747;u&#8747;, we may fairly infer, that language&#8747; which have kept company through &#8747;o many nation&#8747; mu&#8747;t have been very intimate.

To <i>&#8747;mother</i> al&#8747;o i&#8747; in Dutch <i>&#8747;mooren</i>, and here &#8747;moor. <i>Prune</i> i&#8747; pruyn, and pryun. <i>Loom</i> i&#8747; flow, at pre&#8747;ent applied to a deep place in a river where the cour&#8747;e of the water i&#8747; retarded. <i>&#8747;nippen</i> i&#8747; to nip, with u&#8747; called &#8747;nip, and generally applied to the nipping of another per&#8747;on in matter&#8747; of property. <i>&#8747;wipe</i> i&#8747; a word now unu&#8747;ed in the Engli&#8747;h language, and &#8747;eem&#8747; to have &#8747;unk into &#8747;weep; which however doe&#8747; not convey an accurate idea of the meaning, nor do I know of a &#8747;ingle word that can: an in&#8747;trument for lightening the labour of churning, and bear&#8747; thi&#8747; name, i&#8747; the be&#8747;t explanation. Again: <i>Pronken</i> i&#8747; with u&#8747; to brank or prunk, that i&#8747;, to look proud and haughty; probably from the effe&#392;t of the wooden capi&#8747;trum or head-&#8747;tool, which bear&#8747; that name upon hor&#8747;e&#8747;. <i>Ry&#8747;</i>, with u&#8747; rice, i&#8747; the name of bru&#8747;h-wood; and <i>heel</i>, with u&#8747; <i>hell</i>, to incline a ve&#8747;&#8747;el a&#8747; i&#8747; done in pouring out it&#8747; content&#8747;, &#8747;eem&#8747; to be lo&#8747;t, except in the language of &#8747;eamen. Indeed numberle&#8747;&#8747; are the word&#8747; &#8747;till u&#8747;ed in the Dutch which have cea&#8747;ed and become ob&#8747;olete in the Engli&#8747;h tongue, remembered only amid&#8747;t the vulgarity and &#8747;olitude of &#8747;ome of it&#8747; diale&#392;t&#8747;.</p>
<p>There might al&#8747;o be produced a pretty large number of French relick&#8747;, but one or two may &#8747;erve for a &#8747;pecimen. To <i>fa&#8747;h</i>, among&#8747;t the&#8747;e diale&#392;t&#8747; i&#8747; to trouble or di&#8747;quiet; and the French u&#8747;e <i>facher</i> in a &#8747;imilar &#8747;en&#8747;e. The word <i>bat</i>, for a &#8747;troke, i&#8747; a&#8747; much a-kin to their verb <i>batter</i>, a&#8747; the common word&#8747; battle, battalia, battery, <i>&#38;c.</i> The broad <i>ey</i> or <i>eigh</i>, and <i>ya</i> of the North (&#8747;ignifying <i>ye&#8747;</i>,) are a&#8747; near a&#8747; <i>aye</i> to their <i>oui</i>. But the arbitrary interpo&#8747;ition of con&#8747;onant&#8747; between open vowel&#8747; merely (which one would hardly &#8747;u&#8747;pect,) Euphonii&#8747; Gratia i&#8747; the greate&#8747;t re&#8747;emblance, having few circum&#8747;tance&#8747; in the real Engli&#8747;h &#8747;imilar to it, except the u&#8747;e of the particle&#8747; <i>a</i> and <i>an</i>; improvement indeed ha&#8747; given it in the French rule&#8747; and limit&#8747;, which are not to be expe&#392;ted here.</p>
<p>It might however have been expe&#392;ted, that the Latin Tongue would have left more numerou&#8747; trace&#8747; of it&#8747;elf, amid&#8747;t the barbari&#8747;m&#8747; of the Northern diale&#392;t&#8747;, than are now to be found; e&#8747;pecially if we con&#8747;ider that two third&#8747; of the force&#8747; which the Roman&#8747; employed in Britain were generally lodged on the Border&#8747;. However, the &#8747;ame cau&#8747;e which then detained the Roman&#8747; upon the pre&#8747;ent boundarie&#8747; of the two kingdom&#8747;, afterward&#8747; effaced almo&#8747;t every ve&#8747;tige of them; for the nation&#8747; whom they had long re&#8747;i&#8747;ted, afterward&#8747; ru&#8747;hing in, &#8747;wept away every mark of them in a civil re&#8747;pe&#392;t, and left nothing almo&#8747;t but the ruin&#8747; of their fortification&#8747; and of their rampire. The word <i>whinny</i>, however, for the neighing of a hor&#8747;e, &#8747;trongly re&#8747;emble&#8747; their <i>hinnio</i>. <i>To &#8747;cribe</i>, i&#8747; &#8747;till <i>to write</i>; and the <i>flocci</i> of the Latin&#8747; i&#8747; &#8747;till flock&#8747;. However, there i&#8747;, e&#8747;pecially if we con&#8747;ider the almo&#8747;t unparalleled de&#8747;olation which reigned in the&#8747;e part&#8747; for many hundred of year&#8747;, no more rea&#8747;on for con&#8747;idering the&#8747;e a&#8747; dire&#392;tly retained from the Roman&#8747;, than there i&#8747; for &#8747;uppo&#8747;ing the Greek name of <i>flocci</i>, viz. <unclear/> and it&#8747; verb <unclear/> to be immediately de&#8747;cended to <i>u&#8747;</i>; becau&#8747;e the nap of cloth, called in Cumberland <i>knap</i>, and the verb <i>knap</i>, &#8747;ignifying the a&#392;tion of cutting off the flock&#8747;, or, &#8747;till more ab&#8747;olutely, the noi&#8747;e of the &#8747;heer&#8747;, are &#8747;till retained, along with &#8747;everal of their derivative&#8747;.</p>
<p>Of the old Briti&#8747;h Tongue &#8747;till le&#8747;&#8747; remain&#8747;, and probably from the &#8747;ame cau&#8747;e&#8747; a&#392;ting for a longer time. The word <i>Goek</i> (Gowk) i&#8747; indeed &#8747;till the name of a cuckow; and a few more of that kind may yet be found. &#8747;ome author ha&#8747; ob&#8747;erved that the name&#8747; of mountain&#8747; and river&#8747; &#8747;eldom change in the flu&#392;tuation of language&#8747;; thi&#8747; i&#8747; amply verified in the&#8747;e part&#8747; by the many Briti&#8747;h name&#8747; which they &#8747;till retain: We may

add to the&#8747;e the name&#8747; of many town&#8747; and vallie&#8747;, &#8747;uch a&#8747; Penrith, Penruddock, Caerdunnock, Glencoyn, Glenrudden, and to the&#8747;e the curiou&#8747; compound name of Tor-pen-how.</p>
<p>&#8747;o far have I thought it nece&#8747;&#8747;ary to take notice of the conne&#392;tion of the general diale&#392;t of the&#8747;e part&#8747; with other tongue&#8747;, either dead or living; further variation&#8747;, which may have happened to all diale&#392;t&#8747; alike, have no conne&#392;tion with the pre&#8747;ent &#8747;ubje&#392;t. It would indeed be a curiou&#8747; employment for hi&#8747;tory to take notice of the time&#8747; when, and the rea&#8747;on&#8747; why &#8747;ome term&#8747; have cea&#8747;ed in one mode of &#8747;peech whil&#8747;t they remained in another: but they were beneath it&#8747; notice; be&#8747;ide&#8747;, they probably cea&#8747;ed in a gradual manner; and it generally take&#8747; notice of thing&#8747; which have either &#8747;uddenly &#8747;tarted into notice, or have been &#8747;uddenly de&#8747;troyed. I &#8747;peak with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to matter&#8747; of thi&#8747; nature, for great thing&#8747; will alway&#8747; demand attention.</p>
<p>There i&#8747; another thing to which, though belonging to language in general, I beg leave to advert: Word&#8747; frequently, in their variou&#8747; compo&#8747;ition, and kindred reference&#8747;, begin at la&#8747;t to forget their original import; and that the more rapidly a&#8747; any language i&#8747; the more un&#8747;ettled; for there i&#8747; a &#8747;ort of poetry belonging to the human mind which i&#8747; very apt in di&#8747;cour&#8747;e to &#8747;ub&#8747;titute re&#8747;embling thing&#8747; for one another; or where the cau&#8747;e and it&#8747; effe&#392;t are proportional, to u&#8747;e them indi&#8747;criminately: or again, in a &#8747;till more di&#8747;tant analogy, to &#8747;peak in higher metaphor&#8747;; and, by dint of habit and continual acceptation, to forget that the phra&#8747;e&#8747; which we u&#8747;e are merely emblematic; nor find it an ea&#8747;y matter, on account of a familiarity with them, a&#8747; the name&#8747; of thing&#8747; of which they are really but the type, to re&#8747;olve them into their original principle&#8747;. &#8747;ubtile men have taken advantage of thi&#8747; prepo&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion, and have con&#8747;tructed curiou&#8747; theorie&#8747; upon it. That my meaning may be more clearly under&#8747;tood, I &#8747;hall &#8747;ubjoin an example or two. We &#8747;peak familiarly of a <i>mellow-&#8747;ound</i>, and a <i>mellow-apple</i>; that i&#8747; of two thing&#8747;, (the &#8747;ound and the apple,) exceedingly different; yet becau&#8747;e the effe&#392;t which they produce on the &#8747;en&#8747;e&#8747; i&#8747; &#8747;omehow or other &#8747;imilar, we couple them with the &#8747;ame epithet; and having given a name to the &#8747;en&#8747;ation excited by the apple, we fir&#8747;t apply it to the apple it&#8747;elf, and then to the &#8747;ound which excited a &#8747;omewhat-&#8747;imilar &#8747;en&#8747;ation; yet &#8747;till we &#8747;peak metaphorically, giving the name&#8747; of our own feeling&#8747; to the thing&#8747; which excited them: likewi&#8747;e, when the cau&#8747;e corre&#8747;pond&#8747; with it&#8747; effe&#392;t, we u&#8747;e them indi&#8747;criminately for each other, whether the Bi&#8747;hop of Cloyne will give u&#8747; leave or not: thu&#8747;, to contain impre&#8747;&#8747;ion upon the &#8747;en&#8747;e&#8747; from external obje&#392;t&#8747;, we give the name of <i>Weight</i> and <i>Heavine&#8747;&#8747;</i>, for the feeling or effe&#392;t i&#8747; proportional to the cau&#8747;e or body that pre&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;. Again: When a &#8747;imilar &#8747;en&#8747;ation i&#8747; excited by di&#8747;ea&#8747;e, we give it the name of Weight, though there i&#8747; no pre&#8747;&#8747;ing body in the ca&#8747;e; thence, carrying it further &#8747;till to that feeling of mind which untoward circum&#8747;tance&#8747; produce, we give name of Heavine&#8747;&#8747; and &#8747;adne&#8747;&#8747; when no di&#8747;ea&#8747;e i&#8747; pre&#8747;ent, from it&#8747; re&#8747;embling the &#8747;en&#8747;ation&#8747; excited by di&#8747;ea&#8747;e; &#8747;peaking &#8747;till in metaphor&#8747;, though uncon&#8747;ciou&#8747; of it from habit, and alway&#8747; thinking that we expre&#8747;&#8747; the thing it&#8747;elf, whil&#8747;t we only expre&#8747;&#8747; it&#8747; corre&#8747;ponding idea on our own mind&#8747;. I have in&#8747;erted the&#8747;e general ob&#8747;ervation&#8747;, becau&#8747;e they are particularly applicable to the diale&#392;t&#8747; of which I am &#8747;peaking; for in them &#8747;uch a mode of &#8747;peech i&#8747; remarkably frequent, and indeed con&#8747;titute&#8747; the principal part of di&#8747;cour&#8747;e. Thu&#8747;, (that I may &#8747;ele&#392;t one or two of the numberle&#8747;&#8747; in&#8747;tance&#8747; that might be produced,) a <i>calm day</i> i&#8747; &#8747;aid to be <i>lown</i>, and a cool-de&#8747;igning man ha&#8747; the &#8747;ame epithet be&#8747;towed on him: <i>&#8747;lape</i> i&#8747; <i>&#8747;lippery</i>, and therefore a per&#8747;on in whom one can repo&#8747;e no confidence i&#8747; a <i>&#8747;lape hand</i>: that which i&#8747; &#8747;mooth and &#8747;oft i&#8747; called &#8747;nod, and hence a man of an ea&#8747;y calm deportment i&#8747; a <i>&#8747;nod fellow</i>. I forbear going further, a&#8747; it would lead me beyond my limit&#8747;; and I &#8747;hall only ob&#8747;erve, that &#8747;uch phra&#8747;e&#8747;, which abound in every language, are like appeal&#8747; from one &#8747;en&#8747;e to another for the truth of the re&#8747;emblance which i&#8747; perceived.</p>
<p>Word&#8747; al&#8747;o, by mean&#8747; of &#8747;uch metaphorical, and I think I may call it arbitrary tran&#8747;po&#8747;ition&#8747;, &#8747;ometime&#8747; entirely lo&#8747;e their original one.

<p>Compound metaphor&#8747; are al&#8747;o very common here, but the re&#8747;olution of them into their original and component part&#8747; i&#8747; often &#8747;o doubtful that there i&#8747; a danger of the Etymologi&#8747;t being liable to &#8747;uch &#8747;arca&#8747;m&#8747; a&#8747; Dean &#8747;wift might be&#8747;tow upon him.

<p>i&#8747; plea&#8747;ing, though it cannot be re&#8747;olved into plain &#8747;en&#8747;e, without taking a&#8747;under the three metaphor&#8747; heaped on each other, which i&#8747; not altogether ea&#8747;y. I al&#8747;o forbear, for brevity’&#8747; &#8747;ake, mentioning the more curiou&#8747; Proverb&#8747; of the&#8747;e part&#8747;; for though proverb&#8747; are generally chara&#392;teri&#8747;tic of the per&#8747;on&#8747; to whom they belong, yet a&#8747; &#8747;everal poem&#8747; in the Cumberland diale&#392;t are at pre&#8747;ent extant, and &#8747;till more about to appear, with a glo&#8747;&#8747;ary affixed, the want of them here will be very well &#8747;upplied. A&#8747; a &#8747;ample however, I &#8747;hall mention “ A&#8747; old a&#8747; Knock-cro&#8747;&#8747;;" which convey&#8747; an idea of antiquity in Cumberland that cannot be expre&#8747;&#8747;ed by a word of le&#8747;&#8747; force than what the ancient&#8747; under&#8747;tood by <i>Ogygian</i>; but Knock-cro&#8747;&#8747; i&#8747; only an upright &#8747;tone, yet &#8747;tanding amid&#8747;t the ruin&#8747; of the Pi&#392;t&#8747; Wall. I may al&#8747;o mention here, that I can ea&#8747;ily count near thirty different name&#8747; for &#8747;troke&#8747; and beating&#8747;, all di&#8747;tin&#392;tly expre&#8747;&#8747;ive of the method&#8747; in which they are infli&#392;ted; but which &#8747;eem to &#8747;hew by their number&#8747; that &#8747;uch thing&#8747; have been very frequent, and have much engro&#8747;&#8747;ed the mind&#8747; of tho&#8747;e who u&#8747;ed them. Above all thing&#8747; however, thi&#8747; diale&#392;t i&#8747; riche&#8747;t in name&#8747; for different kind&#8747; of &#8747;ound&#8747;: every noi&#8747;e ha&#8747; it&#8747; con&#8747;onant name, &#8747;o that the Greek it&#8747;elf i&#8747; left far behind in thi&#8747; re&#8747;pe&#392;t.</p>
<p>In con&#8747;idering the variou&#8747; &#8747;ubje&#392;t&#8747; which naturally fall under the&#8747;e head&#8747;, I often view, with a degree of wonder, that mighty variation which ha&#8747; occa&#8747;ionally taken place in the application of one and the &#8747;ame word, or of it&#8747; derivative&#8747;; a variation increa&#8747;ing in a &#8747;ort of compound proportion of the popularity and antiquity of the word it&#8747;elf. Thi&#8747; ha&#8747; been a thing which ha&#8747; puzzled etymologi&#8747;t&#8747; more perhap&#8747; than any other; finding the &#8747;ame word applied in quite different &#8747;en&#8747;e&#8747;, without being in the lea&#8747;t able to account for the difference: for when the circum&#8747;tance&#8747; which fir&#8747;t occa&#8747;ioned it, by pre&#8747;enting &#8747;ome &#8747;imilarity of idea&#8747;, have cea&#8747;ed, the word &#8747;till remain&#8747;, and give&#8747; birth to fre&#8747;h one&#8747;, in a &#8747;erie&#8747; which &#8747;eem&#8747; a&#8747; if it aro&#8747;e from that poetical turn of which I have already made mention, and which i&#8747; natural to mankind without their being con&#8747;ciou&#8747; of it; beginning, for&#8747;ooth, with thing&#8747; the affinity of which i&#8747; pretty obviou&#8747;, but in proportion a&#8747; they grow numerou&#8747; extend&#8747; it&#8747; plan, multiplie&#8747; not only it&#8747; obje&#392;t&#8747;, but along with them increa&#8747;e&#8747; it&#8747; want of adequate de&#8747;cription in dire&#392;t phra&#8747;e&#8747;; and con&#8747;equently, by mean&#8747; of the &#8747;imilie&#8747; and metaphor&#8747; of different degree&#8747;, which become nece&#8747;&#8747;ary to it, multiplie&#8747; proportionally the mode&#8747; of expre&#8747;&#8747;ion. ‘Ti&#8747; thu&#8747; that in a &#8747;ort of inifinte permutation the native bent of the human mind produce&#8747; the variou&#8747; term&#8747; of a language; and the&#8747;e term&#8747;, among&#8747;t an a&#392;tive people, do not cea&#8747;e to grow more numerou&#8747;, till almo&#8747;t every thing ha&#8747; got a name, and every mode of thinking with which they are acquainted a mode of expre&#8747;&#8747;ion, in &#8747;ome &#8747;ort. After thi&#8747;, the growth of a language i&#8747; but &#8747;low, or perhap&#8747; it i&#8747; &#8747;tatic; for, in general, a&#8747; new thing&#8747; come forward, old one&#8747; are thru&#8747;t out; and thu&#8747; the language of the day may be prevented from acquiring any con&#8747;iderable increa&#8747;e. By the&#8747;e mean&#8747;,

however, it &#8747;eem&#8747; that language in general ha&#8747;, from a few rude and half-articulated &#8747;ound&#8747;, acquired it&#8747; pre&#8747;ent copiou&#8747;ne&#8747;&#8747;, fa&#8747;tidiou&#8747;ne&#8747;&#8747;, and cu&#8747;tom&#8747;. &#8747;uch a theory a&#8747; thi&#8747;, (if it be indeed only a theory,) i&#8747; &#8747;trongly backed by ob&#8747;ervation. Few want&#8747;, and few obje&#392;t&#8747;, have never been found to produce a copiou&#8747; mode of &#8747;peech, and where many want&#8747; and many obje&#392;t&#8747; grew upon tho&#8747;e few, what method could the human mind have of pointing them out, but by an analogy to tho&#8747;e thing&#8747; which were familiar to them before? The derivative&#8747;, which we are &#8747;till able to trace with a tolerable degree of certainty from a very remote &#8747;tock, indicate, that &#8747;uch a comparing principle ha&#8747; had no &#8747;mall &#8747;hare in increa&#8747;ing word&#8747;, and more particularly phra&#8747;e&#8747;: They give u&#8747; al&#8747;o large room to &#8747;u&#8747;pe&#392;t that there i&#8747; a great number more of the &#8747;ame &#8747;ort, the clue of which i&#8747; lo&#8747;t; and that though conje&#392;ture, or perhap&#8747; &#8747;omething more &#8747;ub&#8747;tantial, may occa&#8747;ionally patch up the affinity of &#8747;ome, yet there are other&#8747; which have lo&#8747;t &#8747;ight of their original for ever. We have at lea&#8747;t one &#8747;ati&#8747;fa&#392;tory conclu&#8747;ion from the circum&#8747;tance&#8747; which were mentioned before, that, whatever it wa&#8747; which gave language birth, (and it wa&#8747; probably the imitation of &#8747;ound&#8747;,) &#8747;imile and metaphor have been it&#8747; nur&#8747;e&#8747;. Derivation, indeed, and compo&#8747;ition have lent their aid, but it wa&#8747; a&#8747; &#8747;ubaltern&#8747;, and they only expre&#8747;&#8747;ed partial change&#8747;, affe&#392;ting the meaning of their original&#8747;; wherea&#8747;, be&#8747;ide&#8747; the&#8747;e effe&#392;t&#8747;, the other from their natural tendency often gave expre&#8747;&#8747;ion even to new idea&#8747;. That the reader may have a more compleat notion of what I would inculcate by the foregoing ob&#8747;ervation&#8747;, I &#8747;hall refer him to the treati&#8747;e which that learned oriental Dr Gregory &#8747;harp ha&#8747; writ upon the &#8747;ubje&#392;t of the Origin of Language; he will there find, (what indeed the &#8747;mall number of the Hebrew root&#8747; and the very temper of the language mu&#8747;t have made the Do&#392;tor feel forcibly,) that, even in far different language&#8747;, which were intermingled with a variety of other&#8747;, a &#8747;trange tran&#8747;po&#8747;ition of term&#8747; had occa&#8747;ionally obtained. He relate&#8747;, that from the name of a town in Italy where a &#8747;ort of little &#8747;word&#8747; or dagger&#8747; were fir&#8747;t made, that tho&#8747;e dagger&#8747; took their name; and in imitation of them afterward&#8747;, a &#8747;pani&#8747;h coin, a diminutive gun, and a dapper fellow; for &#8747;uch an account doe&#8747; he give of the word Pi&#8747;tol. From &#8747;imilar cau&#8747;e&#8747; aro&#8747;e the name&#8747; of the <i>Gate&#8747; of Cilicia</i> and <i>Thermopyl&#230;</i>: from a part of the leg the Greek&#8747; took their expre&#8747;&#8747;ion for the continuation of a mountainou&#8747; ridge: the Roman&#8747; and Macedonian&#8747; encountered at a place called <i>the Dog&#8747;’ Head&#8747;</i>; and indeed all language&#8747; &#8747;eem more or le&#8747;&#8747; to abound with name&#8747; originating from re&#8747;emblance&#8747; either dire&#392;t or analogical, applied more or le&#8747;&#8747; in the &#8747;tile of metaphor&#8747;. However, before I go further, it i&#8747; but fair to acknowledge that the language of Ribaldry, or, a&#8747; we were wont to call it, <i>Blackguardi&#8747;m</i>, i&#8747; the mo&#8747;t fertile in thi&#8747; kind of poetry, and that a rude mode of &#8747;peech, from a &#8747;cantine&#8747;&#8747; of certain term&#8747;, i&#8747; more beholden to it than the more copiou&#8747; and poli&#8747;hed, which are on that very account more re&#8747;tri&#392;ted in the u&#8747;e of new phra&#8747;e&#8747;. It i&#8747; thu&#8747; that we talk familiar enough of the head, brow, &#8747;ide, foot, <i>&#38;c.</i> of a hill, without ever adverting to that principle in the human mind which give&#8747; birth to &#8747;uch expre&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747;, though the allu&#8747;ion i&#8747; exceedingly obviou&#8747;. Thu&#8747; al&#8747;o, a&#8747; in Engli&#8747;h the prominence on the face i&#8747; called No&#8747;e, and ha&#8747; a &#8747;imilar name in &#8747;everal language&#8747;, a promontory of land&#8747; ha&#8747; often the &#8747;ame name, e&#8747;pecially in the Northern part&#8747;; or, a&#8747; in &#8747;cotland and the I&#8747;le&#8747;, i&#8747; <i>Ne&#8747;&#8747;</i>; in Norway it &#8747;eem&#8747; to be <i>Naze</i>; and beyond Kam&#8747;chatka, in the narrow extreme of the Great Pacific Ocean, i&#8747; <i>No&#8747;&#8747;</i>: neither will one wonder if all the&#8747;e name&#8747; &#8747;hould be found to have one original, after con&#8747;idering in how prodigiou&#8747; an extent of nation&#8747;, utterly di&#8747;joined, late navigator&#8747; have found diale&#392;t&#8747; of the Malay tongue. The <i>&#8747;neb</i> of the Dutch corre&#8747;pond&#8747; with the word <i>Neb</i> in Cumberland, &#8747;ignifying al&#8747;o no&#8747;e, and thi&#8747; had in a like manner been applied to cape&#8747; and headland&#8747;: one hill al&#8747;o in the&#8747;e part&#8747; i&#8747; called Tongue, and another &#8747;addle-Back. From that part of the entrance of a hou&#8747;e which i&#8747; called Hallen, a narrow turn of the Lake Ulle&#8747;-Water ha&#8747; it&#8747; name: from a part of the Gullet, which i&#8747; called <i>Hau&#8747;e</i>, (a term which &#8747;eem&#8747; undoubtedly a relick of the Latin verb <i>Haurio</i>,) ha&#8747; been taken the word <i>Hau&#8747;e</i>, applied to a narrow entrance into a valley. I need hardly mention, a&#8747; &#8747;imilar to the&#8747;e, that of two hill&#8747; near Winander-Mere, one i&#8747; called <i>Hard-Knot</i>, and the other <i>Wry-No&#8747;e</i>. Application&#8747; of name&#8747; in thi&#8747; manner, derived from the human body, or other thing&#8747;, &#8747;eem, (whether we con&#8747;ider the number&#8747; of them, which we may every day meet with, or the natural di&#8747;po&#8747;ition

<p>&#8747;o much with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to the &#8747;imple mode of tran&#8747;ferring of term&#8747;, on account of re&#8747;emblance from one thing to another: There are however other&#8747;, which, like Dr &#8747;harp’&#8747; word <i>Pi&#8747;tol</i>, go &#8747;till further. That I may &#8747;ay not entangle either my&#8747;elf or my reader in tracing the origin of a number of different term&#8747;, among&#8747;t which, though obviou&#8747;ly a-kin, it i&#8747; impo&#8747;&#8747;ible to know with even a tolerable degree of probability which i&#8747; the elde&#8747;t, I &#8747;hall pick out a certain &#8747;et of word&#8747;, among&#8747;t which I am almo&#8747;t &#8747;ure an affinity &#8747;ub&#8747;i&#8747;t&#8747; throughout; though, like every other &#8747;et, I dare not pretend to &#8747;ay which i&#8747; the ance&#8747;torial word, or that which gave being to the re&#8747;t, or whether any of tho&#8747;e which are now left merit &#8747;uch a name. I am led to the choice of the&#8747;e which follow, by a &#8747;entence in the Appendix to Mr We&#8747;t’&#8747; account of tho&#8747;e Lake&#8747;, in which he mention&#8747; the word <i>&#8747;cale</i>, and give&#8747;, for the &#8747;ake of elucidating the meaning of the word, thi&#8747; quotation, if I recolle&#392;t aright, from &#8747;hake&#8747;pear, “ to &#8747;cale’t a little further." I beg leave however to ob&#8747;erve, before I enter upon the &#8747;ubje&#392;t of the kindred phra&#8747;e&#8747; of the word <i>&#8747;cale</i>, that I think Mr We&#8747;t’&#8747; wi&#8747;h of tracing the Engli&#8747;h language, at lea&#8747;t in &#8747;ome degree, to it&#8747; root&#8747; by mean&#8747; of it&#8747; diale&#392;t&#8747;, a very good one; but that hi&#8747; want of acquaintance with the general mode of accenting particular word&#8747;, and indeed of the general di&#8747;po&#8747;ition of the diale&#392;t, ha&#8747; mi&#8747;led him &#8747;everal time&#8747; in the little which he ha&#8747; attempted of thi&#8747; kind. Guthrie al&#8747;o, a&#8747; far a&#8747; I remember, in hi&#8747; hi&#8747;tory of &#8747;cotland, ha&#8747; &#8747;ome ob&#8747;ervation&#8747; on the diale&#392;t of that country, indicating, that many original phra&#8747;e&#8747; of our language may be found in it, which i&#8747; very true. However, to return to my &#8747;ubje&#392;t; it may be remembered, that in Dutch, <i>&#8747;chil</i>, <i>&#8747;chulp</i>, or <i>&#8747;help</i>, &#8747;ignifie&#8747; a <i>&#8747;hell</i>, which in the diale&#392;t of Cumberland i&#8747; pronounced <i>&#8747;chell</i> or <i>&#8747;kell</i>; in that diale&#392;t al&#8747;o the word i&#8747; u&#8747;ed for a &#8747;cale. Belonging to thi&#8747; word therefore are &#8747;everal verb&#8747;, with their derivative&#8747;: to take any thing from it&#8747; hu&#8747;k, or &#8747;hell, i&#8747; to &#8747;heil or &#8747;hell it, a&#8747; pea&#8747;e, <i>&#38;c.</i> The hu&#8747;k&#8747; of oat&#8747; are called <i>&#8747;killing&#8747;</i> or <i>&#8747;hilling&#8747;</i>, and the kernel&#8747; are <i>groat&#8747;</i>, (what affinity there ha&#8747; been &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed to exi&#8747;t between the&#8747;e and the coin&#8747; of that name, I know not.) Again; to <i>&#8747;cale</i>, i&#8747; to &#8747;trip off &#8747;cale&#8747;, bark, <i>&#38;c.</i>; but i&#8747; more frequently u&#8747;ed in a natural &#8747;en&#8747;e: thu&#8747; any kind of cru&#8747;t or &#8747;curf, occa&#8747;ioned by di&#8747;ea&#8747;e on the body, i&#8747; &#8747;aid, on it&#8747; being detached from it, or falling a&#8747;under, to <i>&#8747;cale off</i>.

<p>V. Having &#8747;aid what may be thought perhap&#8747; more than enough on diale&#392;t&#8747;, I proceed to make &#8747;ome ob&#8747;ervation&#8747; on the incur&#8747;ive war&#8747; that &#8747;o particularly prevailed on the Border&#8747;: but a&#8747; what ha&#8747; been already &#8747;aid ha&#8747; anticipated a good deal of what belong&#8747; literally to thi&#8747; head, and a&#8747; a regular account of tho&#8747;e bickering&#8747; belong&#8747; not to my purpo&#8747;e, I &#8747;hall be contented with a few quotation&#8747; from different authoritie&#8747;, which will &#8747;erve at lea&#8747;t to &#8747;hew, that the ob&#8747;ervation&#8747; which I have laid down in my fifth paragraph are not without foundation.</p>
<p>When I mentioned Expedition and Plunder a&#8747; the requi&#8747;ite and obje&#392;t of the&#8747;e incur&#8747;ion&#8747;, I meant not only a reference to almo&#8747;t every part of the hi&#8747;tory and character of the people, but an allu&#8747;ion to the monument&#8747;, which are &#8747;till to be &#8747;een, of the velocity and tran&#8747;ient nature of their attack&#8747;. In the fir&#8747;t place, to the circle&#8747; of very old thorn&#8747;, or of other inclo&#8747;ure&#8747; in which the people of each village or hamlet u&#8747;ed to colle&#392;t and watch their cattle by night for fear of a &#8747;urpri&#8747;e; the&#8747;e are now called Lodge&#8747;. The great di&#8747;tance of many of them from the Border prove&#8747; that the &#8747;peed and &#8747;ecrecy of the a&#8747;&#8747;ailant&#8747; mu&#8747;t have been great indeed; e&#8747;pecially if we con&#8747;ider a &#8747;econd circum&#8747;tance, <i>viz.</i> the beacon&#8747;, ere&#392;ted for more &#8747;peedily conveying information of an enemy’&#8747; approach: add to the&#8747;e &#8747;luth-hound&#8747;, with which they were obliged to trace the march of their invi&#8747;ible enemy when retreating; and we &#8747;hall have no occa&#8747;ion of recurring to particular account&#8747; for being &#8747;ati&#8747;fied with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to the encouragement which night and by-way&#8747; would furni&#8747;h to &#8747;uch adventurer&#8747;.</p>
<p>When again we con&#8747;ider that the&#8747;e countie&#8747; are not mentioned in Doom&#8747;day-book, that the boundary of the two kingdom&#8747; wa&#8747; at one time upon &#8747;tane-moor, and another time at the foot of &#8747;ark; that &#8747;tephen &#8747;urrendered Cumberland and We&#8747;tmoreland to the &#8747;cot&#8747; King, and that they were recovered by hi&#8747; &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;or, we need not wonder that the inhabitant&#8747; could not very well know to which kingdom they ought to belong; and therefore could hardly, by mean&#8747; of a reciprocity of intere&#8747;t&#8747;, form any particular attachment to either. The con&#8747;equence&#8747; of thi&#8747;, added to the opportunity and habit of rapine, mu&#8747;t not a little add to their broil&#8747; and in&#8747;tability: thu&#8747; in the time&#8747; of Edward I. when tho&#8747;e countrie&#8747; had long been con&#8747;idered a&#8747; a part of England, we find, that &#8747;everal of the Cumberland gentleman, among&#8747;t who&#8747;e name&#8747; I remember that of &#8747;eaton Lord of Gamel&#8747;by, and Gla&#8747;&#8747;onby, forfeited their e&#8747;tate&#8747; for taking the part of Robert Bruce and the &#8747;cot&#8747; again&#8747;t him. Indeed there long &#8747;ub&#8747;i&#8747;ted an intimacy, by mean&#8747; of very clo&#8747;e family-conne&#392;tion&#8747;, between the principal familie&#8747; of Cumberland and tho&#8747;e of the oppo&#8747;ite &#8747;ide of the Firth, particularly of Annandale: before that period, the di&#8747;turbance&#8747; had a more irregular, though perhap&#8747; a le&#8747;&#8747; perniciou&#8747; dire&#392;tion; and he, by inflaming former animo&#8747;itie&#8747;, and by putting an end to all &#8747;uch conne&#392;tion&#8747;, (at lea&#8747;t a&#8747; far a&#8747; the &#8747;everity of hi&#8747; government could do it,) made the di&#8747;tin&#392;tion between an Engli&#8747;hman and &#8747;cot&#8747;man ob&#8747;erved with a more rancorou&#8747; nicety than before. It i&#8747; true, we are informed, that when the Roman&#8747; fir&#8747;t quitted their rampire and for&#8747;ook Britain, the fury of the Barbarian&#8747; wa&#8747; &#8747;uch a&#8747; to de&#8747;troy even every thing that might be a ve&#8747;tige of it&#8747;elf; but the retreat of many of the &#8747;axon&#8747; northward, on the Norman inva&#8747;ion, and &#8747;everal circum&#8747;tance&#8747; prior to that event, had produced con&#8747;iderable, though only temporary change&#8747;; for though one remember&#8747; the horrid fury of the Gallovegian&#8747; in their inva&#8747;ion&#8747;, yet one al&#8747;o call&#8747; to mind certain interval&#8747; of tranquility, wherein the temper of individual&#8747; produced no &#8747;uch continual effe&#392;t&#8747; a&#8747; took place afterward&#8747;. We find, moreover, the Cumbri mentioned a&#8747; compo&#8747;ing a part of the army which the &#8747;cot&#8747; King David led again&#8747;t &#8747;tephen, before that country wa&#8747; regularly ceded to the &#8747;cot&#8747;; and a&#8747; in the next reign they compo&#8747;ed a part of the Engli&#8747;h force&#8747;, one may infer that their attachment to neither could be very &#8747;trong. Likewi&#8747;e, when we are told that Cumberland, long before the period of which we are &#8747;peaking, wa&#8747; ceded to the &#8747;cot&#8747; on the condition of paying homage for it “ for fear “ it &#8747;hould revolt," we may be pretty well &#8747;ati&#8747;fied in what light the attachment of it&#8747; inhabitant&#8747; to their &#8747;outhern neighbour&#8747; wa&#8747; viewed: nor i&#8747; it wonderful, that &#8747;uch attachment wa&#8747; con&#8747;idered a&#8747; &#8747;u&#8747;piciou&#8747;, when one refle&#392;t&#8747; that the&#8747;e Cumbri were a part of the Briton&#8747; whom the intru&#8747;ion of their &#8747;axon conqueror&#8747; had forced to

to the northward&#8747;, in the &#8747;ame manner a&#8747; it compelled another portion to a &#8747;imilar refuge among&#8747;t the mountain&#8747; of Wale&#8747;, and a&#8747; many of tho&#8747;e very &#8747;axon&#8747; were afterward&#8747; forced to give way to, and &#8747;eek refuge from the prevailing power of the Norman&#8747;. A ce&#8747;&#8747;ion of the country from Tweed to Eden wa&#8747; again made by Edgar to Kenneth, on condition that the inhabitant&#8747; &#8747;hould retain their ancient name, language, and cu&#8747;tom&#8747;: a ce&#8747;&#8747;ion which &#8747;eem&#8747; a&#8747; if calculated for keeping up broil&#8747;, for laying the foundation of con&#8747;equent claim&#8747; from the Engli&#8747;h, and for alienating the mind&#8747; of the inhabitant&#8747; from both partie&#8747;. Indeed the independence of their chieftain&#8747; mu&#8747;t have been con&#8747;iderable, and not a little flattered, when Malcolm refu&#8747;ed the award of Engli&#8747;h Peer&#8747; in hi&#8747; di&#8747;pute with Rufu&#8747; concerning hi&#8747; po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747; in England, becau&#8747;e it had been cu&#8747;tomary that di&#8747;pute&#8747; &#8747;hould be &#8747;ettled by “ principal men on the Marche&#8747;."</p>
<p>After the conque&#8747;t, we find that the number and dignity of the &#8747;axon Refugee&#8747; in &#8747;cotland wa&#8747; very great; but a&#8747; a cau&#8747;e of many very &#8747;hocking outrage&#8747; and butcherie&#8747; that there exi&#8747;ted in the Highlander&#8747;, and Gallowaymen, an exce&#8747;&#8747;ive hatred of the Engli&#8747;h-&#8747;cot&#8747;, which hatred they di&#8747;played on every opportunity. The Highlander&#8747; indeed to thi&#8747; day chu&#8747;e to be con&#8747;idered a&#8747; a di&#8747;tin&#392;t people from the Lowland-&#8747;cot&#8747;, and it i&#8747; &#8747;aid that a diale&#392;t of the Galic, or Er&#8747;e tongue, wa&#8747; &#8747;poke within the la&#8747;t 130 year&#8747; by the old people in Galloway and it&#8747; neighbouring part&#8747;: thence we are led to conclude, that they are a remnant of tho&#8747;e Cumbri or <i>Guidhelian</i> Briton&#8747;, who&#8747;e capitol wa&#8747; Dumbarton, and whom their extreme we&#8747;tern &#8747;ituation, and hatred of intruder&#8747;, had in &#8747;ome mea&#8747;ure, like the Wel&#8747;h, prevented from entirely blending with the neighbouring people; and were they not in the account&#8747; of the &#8747;ame time&#8747; called Gallovegian&#8747;, one might &#8747;u&#8747;pe&#392;t them to be the <i>Cumbri</i> mentioned before a&#8747; compo&#8747;ing a part of David’&#8747; army. Be thi&#8747; a&#8747; it will, &#8747;ure it i&#8747;, that &#8747;uch varietie&#8747; of people frequently gave occa&#8747;ion to quarrel&#8747; and blood&#8747;hed.</p>
<p>We know, moreover, that many of the great men in tho&#8747;e part&#8747; had po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747; on both &#8747;ide&#8747; of the Border; nay, the ance&#8747;tor&#8747; of Robert Bruce him&#8747;elf were of Cleveland in York&#8747;hire, before they were Lord&#8747; of Annandale: &#8747;uch were, however, the men who are &#8747;aid to have invited Haquin of Norway to invade &#8747;cotland; and after he wa&#8747; defeated at <i>Larg&#8747;</i>, we find Neville, apprehen&#8747;ive of the revenge of the &#8747;cotti&#8747;h King, a&#8747;king for more force&#8747; from hi&#8747; ma&#8747;ter Henry III. Thi&#8747; may &#8747;erve for one &#8747;pecimen, out of a hi&#8747;tory that teem&#8747; with them, of the &#8747;mall re&#8747;pe&#392;t paid by &#8747;uch men toward&#8747; the government under who&#8747;e prote&#392;tion (little better than nominal indeed) they enjoyed a part, or perhap&#8747; the whole of their po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747;: nor were &#8747;uch doing&#8747; confined to time&#8747; of war; if a peace or a truce checked them for a little, it wa&#8747; only to give occa&#8747;ion to feud&#8747; of a more &#8747;ecret nature, and war&#8747; carried on in covert, &#8747;oon to break out and embroil their neighbour&#8747;.</p>
<p>Alexander of &#8747;cotland, to revenge the crueltie&#8747; which King John had committed in hi&#8747; dominion&#8747;, ravaged We&#8747;tmoreland and Cumberland in a mo&#8747;t compleat and dreadful manner. A &#8747;ort of accommodation wa&#8747; patched up with him in the reign of Henry III. by which he wa&#8747; allowed <i>L</i>. 200 a year in land&#8747; whereon no ca&#8747;tle&#8747; &#8747;tood in Cumberland and Northumberland; a plan which, like the former, wa&#8747; feeding a fire with moi&#8747;t fuel. After the battle of Bannock&#8747;burn the de&#8747;olation in the North of England wa&#8747; &#8747;till more general: and not to recite a number of particular&#8747;, which any one may find in hi&#8747;tory, I &#8747;hall drop thi&#8747; &#8747;ubje&#392;t, with ob&#8747;erving, that notwith&#8747;tanding the great care that wa&#8747; taken in the time of Richard II. to &#8747;ettle the di&#8747;turbance&#8747;, when it wa&#8747; agreed (to prevent their cau&#8747;e&#8747;) that theft&#8747; &#8747;hould be pur&#8747;ued with hound and horn into either kingdom, and no one on pain of death impede the pur&#8747;uit; then al&#8747;o the code of law&#8747; (&#8747;uch a&#8747; they were) received their regular compilation: all, notwith&#8747;tanding, wa&#8747; of no avail; and in the day&#8747; of Henry IV. Cumberland and Northumberland were &#8747;o entirely ravaged, and made de&#8747;olate, that the King remitted, even after the rebellion of the Piercie&#8747;, all their taxe&#8747; and crown-debt&#8747;.</p>

neighbourhood; and a&#8747; a detail of very many particular&#8747; will be in&#8747;erted in the account which accompanie&#8747; the Plan&#8747;, &#8747;hall ju&#8747;t &#8747;ubjoin the rea&#8747;on why a great number of &#8747;uch relick&#8747; may be expe&#392;ted, and do really exi&#8747;t in the&#8747;e part&#8747;; and indeed, amid&#8747;t the veneration excited by &#8747;uch obje&#392;t&#8747;, we are apt enough to be curiou&#8747; with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to the cau&#8747;e that produced them: however, a&#8747; &#8747;uch an account can only be a very brief recital of general tran&#8747;a&#392;tion&#8747;, I hope I &#8747;hall be excu&#8747;ed, if, not attempting any thing particularly calculated for the learned Antiquarian, I recite a few thing&#8747; that may po&#8747;&#8747;ibly not be unacceptable to a beginner in the &#8747;tudy of pa&#8747;t age&#8747;.</p>
<p>We find Cumberland mentioned a&#8747; being a di&#8747;tin&#392;t kingdom &#8747;o late a&#8747; they year 946; and long after that, it had King&#8747; of it&#8747; own who were almo&#8747;t independent. The tomb of it&#8747; la&#8747;t King Dunmail i&#8747; yet to be &#8747;een on the confine&#8747; of Lanca&#8747;hire, on the road that lead&#8747; from the Vale of &#8747;t John’&#8747;, at a place which i&#8747; called Dunmail-Ray&#8747;. It appear&#8747; from the material&#8747; of thi&#8747; tomb, which i&#8747; nothing but a large heap of &#8747;tone&#8747;, that the ancient rude, and (if I may be allowed the expre&#8747;&#8747;ion) druidical rite&#8747; of &#8747;epulture, were &#8747;till in vogue; or at lea&#8747;t, that tho&#8747;e of chri&#8747;tianity had not yet taken place. The prodigiou&#8747; tra&#392;t of country over which the fir&#8747;t Bi&#8747;hop&#8747; of Lendi&#8747;fairn pre&#8747;ided, and the annual circuit&#8747; which they made for the purpo&#8747;e&#8747; of conver&#8747;ion, add to the truth of thi&#8747; ob&#8747;ervation. Hi&#8747;tory indeed, alway&#8747; &#8747;ay&#8747;, that Cumberland wa&#8747; brought into &#8747;ubje&#392;tion by the &#8747;axon&#8747; later than any other part of England; and thi&#8747; will account for the many Briti&#8747;h relick&#8747; to be found there. The Briton&#8747; might, it i&#8747; true, be Chri&#8747;tian&#8747; before the arrival of the &#8747;axon&#8747;, but the monument of King Dunmail &#8747;hew&#8747; that they had not, even long after that, adopted the pra&#392;tice in general of what we call Chri&#8747;tian Burial: from thence we may infer with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to other thing&#8747;, and indeed ea&#8747;ily bring manifold authoritie&#8747; to &#8747;upport the variou&#8747; circum&#8747;tance&#8747; ari&#8747;ing from &#8747;uch an inference, independent of that &#8747;olitude, and that wildne&#8747;&#8747;, which, a&#8747; they ob&#8747;tru&#392;t commerce, prevent innovation. I &#8747;hall but in&#8747;tance one: Everard, Abbot of Holm-Cultreyn, who lived in the reign of Henry II. tell&#8747; u&#8747;, that the name of <i>Thor&#8747;by</i> i&#8747; from a temple which the Pagan&#8747; had there; and that a place near it called <i>Carthew</i>, (at pre&#8747;ent <i>Cardew</i>) &#8747;ignifie&#8747; the Fen of God. I might mention al&#8747;o, that the village <i>Kirkby-Thor</i> in We&#8747;tmoreland remind&#8747; one of the &#8747;ame barbarou&#8747; <i>God</i> that <i>Thor&#8747;by</i> doe&#8747;; and they both, along with many more, indicate a long and tenaciou&#8747; remembrance of former prejudice&#8747;. Nor do &#8747;uch place&#8747; &#8747;eem to have been afterward&#8747;, probably from their &#8747;ituation, favourable to regular in&#8747;titution&#8747; of a religiou&#8747; kind: the church of <i>Bewca&#8747;tle</i> (which wa&#8747; indeed expo&#8747;ed to enemie&#8747; in a particular manner) had in the day&#8747; of Edward I. an income of <i>L</i>. 19 per annum, in tho&#8747;e of Henry VIII. of <i>L</i>. 2. and in the time of war, Nohing.</p>
<p>With re&#8747;pe&#392;t to Roman antiquitie&#8747; I need only ob&#8747;erve, that two third&#8747; of the &#8747;tationary force&#8747; which they maintained in Britain were, according to the be&#8747;t hi&#8747;torian&#8747;, employed on the Border&#8747;; where the Roman&#8747; them&#8747;elve&#8747; relate, that their &#8747;oldier&#8747; carried on a bu&#8747;ine&#8747;&#8747; literally the &#8747;ame a&#8747; mo&#8747;&#8747;-trooping with the barbarian&#8747;. Their double rampart wa&#8747; afterward&#8747; built; and then the Barbarian&#8747; pa&#8747;&#8747;ed the &#8747;olway in their carroch&#8747;, finding there an unprote&#392;ted coa&#8747;t, and an opportunity of renewing their ravage&#8747;; thi&#8747; obliged the defender&#8747; to double their vigilance, and increa&#8747;e the number of their po&#8747;t&#8747; in that quarter. We find mention of the great &#8747;tilicho him&#8747;elf having hi&#8747; camp at Elne-Foot, on that &#8747;ame coa&#8747;t, for the purpo&#8747;e of watching the motion&#8747; of &#8747;o re&#8747;tle&#8747;&#8747; an enemy; and the ve&#8747;tige&#8747; of &#8747;uch a camp, together with in&#8747;cription&#8747; on &#8747;tone&#8747; found in certain part&#8747; of it, are yet to be &#8747;een. The Roman&#8747; have, in con&#8747;equence of &#8747;uch circum&#8747;tance&#8747;, left many mark&#8747; of the attention which they paid to the We&#8747;tern boundary of their empire; the remain&#8747; of their encampment&#8747;, their road&#8747;, their rampire, and their religion, are many, and &#8747;ome of their fortre&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747; are not yet altogether in ruin&#8747;.</p>
<p>I know of nothing particular with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to the &#8747;axon&#8747; in the&#8747;e part&#8747;: the name&#8747; of town&#8747; in &#8747;axon termination&#8747; are pretty much the &#8747;ame a&#8747; in other countie&#8747; of England; only that of <i>Barrow</i> i&#8747;, perhap&#8747; owing to the nature of the country, more frequent than el&#8747;ewhere. The conical tumuli are al&#8747;o very common; but a&#8747; I know not

how to di&#8747;tingui&#8747;h &#8747;axon remain&#8747; from Dani&#8747;h with any degree of certainty, or (in many ca&#8747;e&#8747;) either of them from Briti&#8747;h, I &#8747;hall leave them to be examined more accurately by other&#8747;. There i&#8747; rea&#8747;on however to believe that the Dane&#8747; made their fir&#8747;t &#8747;ettlement in the North of England: they began with Northumberland before any other part; and very long ago are &#8747;aid by hi&#8747;torian&#8747; to have been defeated at Burgh upon &#8747;and&#8747;, in a field at the ea&#8747;tern end of the village which &#8747;till retain&#8747; the name of the battle. Indeed it wa&#8747; likely enough that they &#8747;hould fir&#8747;t attack the more remote part&#8747; of England, and might &#8747;oone&#8747;t effe&#392;t a &#8747;ettlement there; I am therefore inclined to think that the greater number of &#8747;uch remain&#8747; are Dani&#8747;h. The &#8747;hort duration of the power of tho&#8747;e conqueror&#8747;, and their being, before they acquired the &#8747;upreme dominion, almo&#8747;t blended with the &#8747;axon&#8747;, did not give them an opportunity of making great alteration&#8747; in the language or the name&#8747; of place&#8747;. I may ju&#8747;t mention, that <i>Threlkeld</i>, <i>Melmerby</i>, and <i>Ou&#8747;by</i> are &#8747;aid to have their name&#8747; from <i>Thorquil</i>, <i>Melmer</i>, and <i>Ulf</i>, &#8747;on&#8747; of <i>Haldan</i> the Dane or Norwegian, and that a few more derivation&#8747; of thi&#8747; kind are to be found in old writing&#8747;.</p>
<p>The time&#8747; later than the&#8747;e in a manner explain them&#8747;elve&#8747;; and Expe&#392;tation&#8747; will ea&#8747;ily conceive, from the general tenor of hi&#8747;tory, in what a va&#8747;t quantity, and of what kind the ve&#8747;tige&#8747; of former age&#8747; may occur on the Border&#8747;; the de&#8747;olation and &#8747;olitude which often took place did not de&#8747;troy and utterly deface the remnant&#8747; of tho&#8747;e work&#8747;, which were no longer formidable, but by prote&#392;ting them from the unthinking indu&#8747;try of agriculture; and the fa&#8747;tidiou&#8747; nicety of refinement and innovation, &#8747;erved, like the volcanic cru&#8747;t above Herculaneum, to pre&#8747;erve them. I &#8747;peak thi&#8747;, alluding not only to the building&#8747; of tho&#8747;e age&#8747;, of which <i>&#8747;peed</i> number&#8747;, 23 ca&#8747;tle&#8747; in Cumberland, be&#8747;ide&#8747; the &#8747;eat&#8747; of gentlemen, every one of which wa&#8747; a fortre&#8747;&#8747;; or to tho&#8747;e encampment&#8747; which the continual marche&#8747; and countermarche&#8747; of armie&#8747; made nece&#8747;&#8747;ary; or to the field&#8747; of tho&#8747;e battle&#8747; which followed of cour&#8747;e between &#8747;uch enemie&#8747;; or to the religiou&#8747; building&#8747; and gift&#8747; meant to expiate their manifold crime&#8747;; but to the manner&#8747; of men, with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to which a large field i&#8747; here laid open to the Antiquarian.</p>
<p>To the&#8747;e ob&#8747;ervation&#8747; on particular and local circum&#8747;tance&#8747; I &#8747;hall add another, or a thing which wa&#8747; exten&#8747;ive to a terrible degree; for &#8747;uch wa&#8747; that unequalled pe&#8747;tilence which prevailed in the time&#8747; of the third Edward, and Philip de Valoi&#8747;, a&#8747; if tho&#8747;e time&#8747; had wanted any thing to make them taken notice of in hi&#8747;tory, that pe&#8747;tilence which, having raged in all the known part&#8747; of Africa and A&#8747;ia, traver&#8747;ed Europe at length, compleating the havoc of a general war in France, and of an incur&#8747;ive one in the North of England: the &#8747;cot&#8747; at thi&#8747; period took and burned the town of Penrith on a fair-day, carried off the inhabitant&#8747; and country-people whom they found there, and &#8747;old them; but carried along with them an infe&#392;tion, which i&#8747; &#8747;aid to have &#8747;wept off above a third of the nation. I mention thi&#8747;, becau&#8747;e many ve&#8747;tige&#8747; of thi&#8747; plague, and di&#8747;mal tale&#8747; concerning it yet occur, and becau&#8747;e the monki&#8747;h writer&#8747; of the North of England have left account&#8747; of the de&#8747;tru&#392;tion it occa&#8747;ioned, not unlike, if we except for the difference of population, to that of the charter-hou&#8747;e church-yard (I think that i&#8747; the name) in London.</p>
<p>A few loo&#8747;e ob&#8747;ervation&#8747; &#8747;hall fini&#8747;h thi&#8747; &#8747;ubje&#392;t. The monument&#8747; of the Roman&#8747; which have been found in Cumberland &#8747;hew, that far from impo&#8747;ing their own divinitie&#8747; upon the nation&#8747;, they even acquie&#8747;ced in the belief of tho&#8747;e whom they vanqui&#8747;hed, and ere&#392;ted altar&#8747; to the god&#8747; of the part&#8747; where they re&#8747;ided. In later time&#8747; thing&#8747; were altered, and the chara&#392;teri&#8747;tic monument&#8747; are tho&#8747;e of barbari&#8747;m, cruelty, and blood&#8747;hed. Whatever courage continual danger may give to the human mind, it cannot be favourable, on &#8747;everal account&#8747;, to improvement&#8747; or change&#8747; either in religion or manner&#8747;: under it&#8747; impre&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747; there i&#8747; hardly lei&#8747;ure to think of innovation&#8747;; it induce&#8747; moreover a &#8747;uper&#8747;titiou&#8747; dread, which will not ea&#8747;ily permit men to be bold in &#8747;peculation, or dare to annul at once the authority of tho&#8747;e god&#8747; whom they have been taught to con&#8747;ider a&#8747; their prote&#392;tor&#8747;. &#8747;uch a life leave&#8747; no room for

the idea&#8747; of improved &#8747;ociety, nor will it permit the nicetie&#8747; of learning to grow upon the rudene&#8747;&#8747; of antiquated &#8747;uper&#8747;tition. Whil&#8747;t it prevent&#8747; &#8747;tudy and refinement at home, it al&#8747;o repel&#8747; the mean&#8747; of them from abroad; by threatening their teacher&#8747; with the &#8747;ame, or, a&#8747; wa&#8747; often the ca&#8747;e, with greater peril&#8747;. &#8747;uch I apprehend i&#8747; the principal cau&#8747;e of the numerou&#8747; ve&#8747;tige&#8747; of ancient manner&#8747; to be found in the Border&#8747;. We have no doubt how late it wa&#8747; before any degree of civilization ro&#8747;e, and find on record under what difficultie&#8747;, and at how modern a period, Chri&#8747;tianity acquired an e&#8747;tabli&#8747;hment there: for though it might be early known and preached on the We&#8747;tern Border, yet avarice and rapine in a manner quenched it, nor had it a &#8747;eminary or fixed &#8747;eat from whence it could diffu&#8747;e it&#8747;elf. Even after the piou&#8747; bounty of the Royal Earl of Huntingdon had ere&#392;ted Holm-Cultram, and the murderou&#8747; ho&#8747;pitality of the Lord of Gill&#8747;land had given occa&#8747;ion to the building of Lanerco&#8747;t, we find that tho&#8747;e very hou&#8747;e&#8747; were levelled at time&#8747;, or burned, amid&#8747;t the general ruin of the neighbourhood, and the Prie&#8747;t&#8747; butchered, or flying from &#8747;cene&#8747; of almo&#8747;t-unequalled wildne&#8747;&#8747; and de&#8747;olation. Numerou&#8747; &#8747;afeguard&#8747;, (for &#8747;o they are called,) or lodging&#8747; beneath the ground, which al&#8747;o are yet to be &#8747;een, indicate the horrid nature of the&#8747;e tran&#8747;a&#392;tion&#8747;, and hint what the manner&#8747; of men mu&#8747;t have been in tho&#8747;e time&#8747;; for they were time&#8747; when ferociou&#8747; cu&#8747;tom&#8747; &#8747;truck at the very exi&#8747;tence of &#8747;ociety, bidding defiance to all mean&#8747; of civilization&#8747;; when law&#8747; held them in with a pal&#8747;ied hand, and the dependence of the inhabitant&#8747; on a regular government wa&#8747; uncertain and unregarded.</p>
<p>VII. A&#8747; the bu&#8747;ine&#8747;&#8747; of the following Plan&#8747; i&#8747; to condu&#392;t the &#8747;tranger&#8747; to tho&#8747;e place&#8747; which furni&#8747;h the view&#8747; and land&#8747;cape&#8747; of different kind&#8747; in the neighbourhood of the&#8747;e Lake&#8747;, and which the ta&#8747;te of the time&#8747; ha&#8747; been &#8747;o plea&#8747;ed with, I &#8747;hall offer nothing upon that &#8747;ubje&#392;t here, but an ob&#8747;ervation which I think the greate&#8747;t arti&#8747;t will excu&#8747;e: It i&#8747;, that tho&#8747;e pi&#392;ture&#8747; impart the mo&#8747;t grateful &#8747;en&#8747;ation&#8747; to the mind, which are expre&#8747;&#8747;ive, not only of general beautie&#8747;, or &#8747;uch a&#8747; may be found common to mo&#8747;t place&#8747;, but of the particular nature and local geniu&#8747; of the country from the obje&#392;t&#8747; of which they are drawn. Thu&#8747; a funny day, a &#8747;tream of water, a ruin, or other kind of building, may be with almo&#8747;t every where, and may be &#8747;orted in &#8747;uch a manner a&#8747; to form a plea&#8747;ant view: But the &#8747;olemnity of tho&#8747;e vapour&#8747; which hang upon mountain&#8747; in drizzly and gleamy weather, the &#8747;hade&#8747; which they occa&#8747;ion, their &#8747;ilent mixing and rolling together, their magnifying effe&#392;t&#8747;, with the top&#8747; of the mountain&#8747; peeping above, a&#8747; it were in another world, lead away the mind from &#8747;cene&#8747; of cultivation, and pre&#8747;ent idea&#8747; of a new, but not le&#8747;&#8747; plea&#8747;ing kind. It i&#8747; unnatural, at lea&#8747;t it feel&#8747; &#8747;o to me, and &#8747;ubver&#8747;ive of the general tenor of the piece, to be &#8747;tudiou&#8747; of introducing copie&#8747; of the work&#8747; of man, and numerou&#8747; living figure&#8747;, amid&#8747;t &#8747;uch &#8747;olitude&#8747;. For example, I have &#8747;een a drawing of Dun-Dornadilla, in the North-Highland&#8747;, which &#8747;eemed to me excellent in it&#8747; kind: there wa&#8747; a pen&#8747;ive loneline&#8747;&#8747; about that ruined pile which corre&#8747;ponded well with the dreary nakedne&#8747;&#8747; of the va&#8747;t hill&#8747; that ro&#8747;e around it. On the contrary, I have &#8747;een view&#8747; of the mountain&#8747; contiguou&#8747; to the&#8747;e lake&#8747;, at the ba&#8747;e&#8747; of which were delineated chai&#8747;e&#8747; and waggon&#8747;: &#8747;uch vehicle&#8747; might indeed po&#8747;&#8747;ibly be dragged along there, but they were far from being, (if I may be allowed the expre&#8747;&#8747;ion,) native obje&#392;t&#8747;, or con&#8747;onant with the re&#8747;t of the piece.</p>
<p>I may here be a&#8747;ked, what I meant in my &#8747;eventh paragraph, at the beginning of thi&#8747; Introdu&#392;tion, mentioning the affinity between painting and poetry? I may al&#8747;o be told, that many have heard of the &#8747;cene&#8747; to be met with near the&#8747;e lake&#8747;; but where are the poet&#8747;, or the poetry? A&#8747; I have not lei&#8747;ure for an&#8747;wering &#8747;uch que&#8747;tion&#8747; at pre&#8747;ent, I &#8747;hall leave them to be re&#8747;olved at another time.</p>
<p>VIII. I pa&#8747;&#8747; next to a &#8747;ubje&#392;t which fall&#8747; more immediately in my way, and i&#8747; more intimately conne&#392;ted with my pre&#8747;ent bu&#8747;ine&#8747;&#8747;. I mean a general account of the &#8747;oil and weather of the&#8747;e part&#8747;; under which head, though I may take notice of &#8747;ome thing&#8747; common to many place&#8747;, e&#8747;pecially mountainou&#8747; one&#8747;, yet I do not think them on that account le&#8747;&#8747; proper here.</p>

<p>&#8747;everal author&#8747;, who have mentioned the &#8747;oil of the&#8747;e countie&#8747;, have repre&#8747;ented it a&#8747; unfavourable to the growth of timber; which I believe very true with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to the mo&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;, and &#8747;ome other place&#8747;; yet every inhabitant know&#8747;, that the glebe in general, if left to it&#8747;elf, that i&#8747;, if exempted from the plough and the &#8747;cythe, nor trod by cattle, would &#8747;oon be covered with tree&#8747;, and that the country would become one large fore&#8747;t; and thi&#8747; &#8747;hew&#8747; that it&#8747; natural di&#8747;po&#8747;ition i&#8747; not to become a naked woald, but a de&#8747;art of wood. A de&#8747;art of wood it ha&#8747; indeed been, tho’ in many place&#8747; a&#8747; poor a&#8747; that of almo&#8747;t any country, and a&#8747; ill calculated for the purpo&#8747;e&#8747; of agriculture; particularly in the mo&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747; that are among&#8747;t, or perhap&#8747; upon the mountain&#8747;: the&#8747;e however have their wood&#8747;; the birch, the wild-a&#8747;h, the wythe, a&#8747; it i&#8747; called, and &#8747;ome other&#8747;, are di&#8747;po&#8747;ed to grow even in the wilde&#8747;t &#8747;ituation&#8747;: &#8747;low in their growth, it i&#8747; true, and for the mo&#8747;t part &#8747;tunted; which may be attributed to their being grazed upon by &#8747;heep, and naked to the wind&#8747;; for a&#8747; tho&#8747;e place&#8747; which &#8747;eem at pre&#8747;ent mo&#8747;t unpromi&#8747;ing with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to thi&#8747; kind of vegetation, and where (particularly in peat-mo&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747; on the top&#8747; of pretty high hill&#8747;) no man can ea&#8747;ily per&#8747;uade him&#8747;elf that a &#8747;tick of any kind would grow, are found yet filled with the root&#8747;, trunk&#8747;, and branche&#8747; of tree&#8747; of very different &#8747;ize&#8747;; it &#8747;eem&#8747; a&#8747; if tho&#8747;e place&#8747; did but want their original encouragement to become fore&#8747;t&#8747; again. It may indeed be alledged, in oppo&#8747;ition to &#8747;uch a thought, that the &#8747;oil it&#8747;elf ha&#8747; undergone a material change, that the fall of the wood&#8747; and the &#8747;tagnation of water&#8747; ha&#8747; given birth to that vegetation which con&#8747;titute&#8747; peat-mo&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;, and that thi&#8747; vegetation in an accumulation of putrid vegetable matter. If thi&#8747; be the ca&#8747;e, yet &#8747;till &#8747;uch putrid matter i&#8747; found to be that of the root&#8747; of that plant, which in the&#8747;e part&#8747; i&#8747; called <i>Bent</i>, and not of timber, which i&#8747; generally pre&#8747;erved entire; and a&#8747; thi&#8747; Bent &#8747;eem&#8747; the native and aboriginal growth of &#8747;uch Moor&#8747;, who can prove that it did not exi&#8747;t at the &#8747;ame time a&#8747; the wood&#8747;, and that it did not occa&#8747;ion mo&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747; then? Independent, however, of thi&#8747;, the circum&#8747;tance&#8747; which have fallen in the way of my ob&#8747;ervation make me think it far from impo&#8747;&#8747;ible, that, were the&#8747;e countrie&#8747; left de&#8747;olate by man and the tamer animal&#8747;, for a great number of year&#8747; that the ancient appearance&#8747; would ari&#8747;e at large, and a &#8747;ylvan wildne&#8747;&#8747; efface the labour&#8747; of the hu&#8747;bandman: thi&#8747; would begin probably in the warmer and more fertile place&#8747;, and proceed gradually, one tree &#8747;heltering and encouraging another, to tho&#8747;e which are more expo&#8747;ed and barren. There are &#8747;till whole fore&#8747;t&#8747; left on the &#8747;ide&#8747; of &#8747;ome hill&#8747;, where many of the tree&#8747; find nutriment almo&#8747;t upon the bare rock; they are al&#8747;o to be found in the more inacce&#8747;&#8747;ible part&#8747; of other&#8747;, that are el&#8747;ewhere naked. I do not indeed know of any po&#8747;itive evidence that can be produced, either on thi&#8747; &#8747;ide of the que&#8747;tion or on the oppo&#8747;ite one, neither doe&#8747; the di&#8747;cu&#8747;&#8747;ion of it belong particularly to my &#8747;ubje&#392;t; yet it may be proper to mention, a&#8747; analogou&#8747; to what ha&#8747; gone before, that in three old manu&#8747;cript&#8747; I have found mention made of the porkling&#8747; which ran wild in the wood&#8747; growing on the &#8747;ide&#8747; of the hill&#8747; above Mungri&#8747;dale; that the&#8747;e porkling&#8747; belonged to the Monk&#8747;, who had a chauntry at a place called &#8747;tow in that neighbourhood; that from the&#8747;e Monk&#8747; the chapel ha&#8747; a part of it&#8747; name, and the other part from the old word &#8747;ignifying &#8747;wine. In Gri&#8747;dale al&#8747;o you will, a&#8747; in many other place&#8747;, be told by &#8747;ome per&#8747;on or another, that in former time&#8747; the tree&#8747; were &#8747;o clo&#8747;e together, that a man ha&#8747; gone a certain di&#8747;tance, or a&#8747;cended &#8747;uch or &#8747;uch a hill, without touching the ground, and merely travelling from the top of one tree to that of another; nor are the&#8747;e time&#8747; &#8747;o very remote, but your informer will in general tell you the name of the man who&#8747;e forefather, at the di&#8747;tance of three or four age&#8747;, he wa&#8747;; yet a place le&#8747;&#8747; likely for the growth of timber, or more devoid of it at pre&#8747;ent, will not ea&#8747;ily be found in the North of England. Even thi&#8747;, however, doe&#8747; not militate again&#8747;t what I formerly advanced; for tree&#8747; will grow there, if encouraged; and &#8747;ome kind&#8747;, a&#8747; the a&#8747;p, &#8747;eem particularly di&#8747;po&#8747;ed to propagate them&#8747;elve&#8747;. But the fore&#8747;t and it&#8747; wild inhabitant&#8747; generally &#8747;hrink from the pre&#8747;ence of man!</p>

I have heard al&#8747;o, that King John wa&#8747; very intent on de&#8747;troying the fore&#8747;t&#8747; of the North of England, and cau&#8747;ed a great quantity of ground to be cleared; but neither of the&#8747;e cau&#8747;e&#8747; affe&#392;t much the di&#8747;fore&#8747;ting of which we now &#8747;peak, of which the effe&#392;t&#8747; are at thi&#8747; day &#8747;o vi&#8747;ible, and which, at lea&#8747;t in my opinion, wa&#8747; the work of many age&#8747;, and undertaken on very different occa&#8747;ion&#8747;. Great road&#8747; generally carry a degree of cultivation into the particular di&#8747;tri&#392;t through which they pa&#8747;&#8747;, and the le&#8747;&#8747; important one&#8747;, or by-way&#8747;, may be &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed to have a &#8747;imilar effe&#392;t; though we find that in &#8747;ome place&#8747; of Cumberland tho&#8747;e effe&#392;t&#8747; were often, nay, for the mo&#8747;t part interrupted by the ruggedne&#8747;&#8747; of the country, and the robber&#8747; that infe&#8747;ted &#8747;uch way&#8747;.

Of the&#8747;e I have made mention before; but tho&#8747;e di&#8747;tri&#392;t&#8747; have for the mo&#8747;t part been cultivated at a later period than the re&#8747;t, where the hou&#8747;e&#8747; &#8747;tand di&#8747;tin&#392;t from one another, each in their own portion of land, and with it&#8747; own name; for &#8747;uch were inclo&#8747;ed, or at lea&#8747;t marked out all at once; and every man fixed hi&#8747; re&#8747;idence in the portion allotted to him, a&#8747; i&#8747; at pre&#8747;ent not uncommon on the inclo&#8747;ure of pa&#8747;ture-ground&#8747;.

<p>When therefore I &#8747;ay that the nature of the &#8747;oil of the&#8747;e countrie&#8747; particularly incline&#8747; them to become a fore&#8747;t, I compri&#8747;e their general chara&#392;ter; which I cannot better exemplify, than by taking notice of the prodigiou&#8747; oak&#8747;, yew&#8747;, elm&#8747;, and other tree&#8747; which lately were and indeed yet are vi&#8747;ible in many place&#8747;. I may add, that the vein&#8747; of mineral&#8747; are numerou&#8747; in the mountain&#8747;; that the black-lead of Borrodale i&#8747; almo&#8747;t a peculiarity; nor i&#8747; the &#8747;late of &#8747;ome quarrie&#8747; much le&#8747;&#8747; than one.</p>
<p>I &#8747;ubjoin here two or three quotation&#8747; re&#8747;pe&#392;ting the fir&#8747;t &#8747;ettlement of men on certain part&#8747; of the county of Cumberland, or at lea&#8747;t the fir&#8747;t &#8747;ettlement we are acquainted with, that it may be more clearly under&#8747;tood what wa&#8747; meant in the paragraph preceding the la&#8747;t. We find it mentioned, that Henry III. in the third year of hi&#8747; reign, di&#8747;fore&#8747;ted that part of the <i>Fore&#8747;t of Englewood</i> which i&#8747; contiguou&#8747; to the town of Dal&#8747;ton. William de la Wa&#8747;t-dale, a hermit, wa&#8747; the fir&#8747;t who made any inclo&#8747;ure&#8747; in &#8747;abergham. Bewca&#8747;tle, a&#8747; it i&#8747; now called, formerly belonged to the Barony of Brough; it wa&#8747; laid wa&#8747;te entirely by the incur&#8747;ion&#8747; of the &#8747;cot&#8747;, until it&#8747; old ma&#8747;ter&#8747; undertook, after a con&#8747;iderable &#8747;pace of time, to feed their cattle there in &#8747;ummer, and con&#8747;tru&#392;ted booth&#8747; and hut&#8747; for the herd&#8747;men: tho&#8747;e becoming permanent habitation&#8747;, are &#8747;aid to have given the name of Booth-ca&#8747;tle, or Bew-ca&#8747;tle, to the old Roman fortre&#8747;&#8747; which &#8747;tood there. Adard de Logili, Lord of Wigton, wa&#8747; the fir&#8747;t who inclo&#8747;ed a parcel of ground near Carli&#8747;le, called Blackhill, from a ri&#8747;ing ground amid&#8747;t it covered with black heath: Cardew, in the &#8747;ame neighbourhood, wa&#8747; made habitable in the time of Rufu&#8747;: Raughton wa&#8747; a de&#8747;art much later, and wa&#8747; fir&#8747;t cleared by one Ughtred (who&#8747;e po&#8747;terity were called de Raughton) being held by him a&#8747; a fee-farm for taking care of the hawk&#8747; in Englewood for the King: &#8747;kelton (formerly &#8747;cale-town, or Villa ad &#8747;calinga&#8747;) wa&#8747; civilized by the Boyvill of Livington, who built <i>&#8747;cale&#8747;</i> here for the watcher&#8747; of hi&#8747; cattle anno 1120, in the reign of Henry I. It wa&#8747; a tra&#392;t covered with whin&#8747;, and indeed &#8747;uch did it&#8747; contiguou&#8747; wa&#8747;te-ground remain, till

within the&#8747;e la&#8747;t 20 year&#8747;. Plumpton wa&#8747; fir&#8747;t di&#8747;parked by Henry VIII. and rendered an habitation of men; it wa&#8747; afterward&#8747; made a manor, and given by Jame&#8747; I. to the Lord Maxwell of &#8747;cotland: moreover, the word Thwaite, Moor, Wood, &#38;c. which make a part of the name&#8747; of &#8747;o many village&#8747;, evidence their &#8747;ituation in former time&#8747;. Omitting, however, further extra&#392;t&#8747; from the account&#8747; which are furni&#8747;hed by manu&#8747;cript&#8747;, or are printed, I &#8747;hall ju&#8747;t quote the relation of the fir&#8747;t &#8747;ettlement of Caldbeck and it&#8747; neighbouring place&#8747;. A high way, or beaten &#8747;treet (the ve&#8747;tige&#8747; of which are yet to be &#8747;een) extended from We&#8747;tmoreland along the mountain called High-&#8747;treet into the ea&#8747;tern &#8747;ide of Cumberland, and thence we&#8747;tward through Caldbeck; a pa&#8747;&#8747;age than which one more ugly, crooked, uneven, or dangerou&#8747;, cannot ea&#8747;ily be conceived. Caldbeck wa&#8747;, long after the conque&#8747;t, a &#8747;avage wa&#8747;te, untamed by human indu&#8747;try; and the re&#8747;t of thi&#8747; road lay through ground&#8747; &#8747;till wilder in their nature, and for the mo&#8747;t part utterly devoid to thi&#8747; day of improvement, of which indeed they are not capable. Robber&#8747;, therefore, who haunted the wood&#8747; and mountain&#8747; through which it pa&#8747;&#8747;ed, made it exceedingly dangerou&#8747;; on which account Randolph Engaine, chief fore&#8747;ter of Englewood, allowed the Prior of Carli&#8747;le to ere&#392;t an ho&#8747;pital for the relief of &#8747;uch pa&#8747;&#8747;enger&#8747; a&#8747; might happen to be a&#8747;&#8747;aulted, and &#8747;tripped or wounded by tho&#8747;e robber&#8747;, or &#8747;topped in their journey by the &#8747;now&#8747; and &#8747;torm&#8747; of Winter. The Prior had al&#8747;o leave to inclo&#8747;e a part where the church now &#8747;tand&#8747;, and thi&#8747; inclo&#8747;ure became afterward&#8747; a portion of the church-glebe; but the fore&#8747;ter would not grant to thi&#8747; e&#8747;tabli&#8747;hment the right of the &#8747;oil, becau&#8747;e large deer lodged in the wood&#8747; of the mountain&#8747; around it, and the whole di&#8747;tri&#392;t wa&#8747; then u&#8747;ed a&#8747; a park or fore&#8747;t; be&#8747;ide&#8747;, the right of the &#8747;oil belonged properly to the heir&#8747; of the Baron&#8747; of Allerdale, of the &#8747;tate of which family at thi&#8747; time a pretty regular account i&#8747; given. After the foundation of the ho&#8747;pital a church wa&#8747; al&#8747;o built in honour of &#8747;t Mungo and Caldbeck; Uppiton (Uppertown) became fully inhabited; He&#8747;ket next, and Halt-Cleugh (or High-Cliff, from the rock above it) were tilled, being likely for producing corn, and called <i>Caldbeck Underfell</i>. The Prior&#8747; of Carli&#8747;le were, by <i>William de Ve&#8747;cy</i> and <i>Burga</i> hi&#8747; wife, and by dame <i>Alice Romeley</i> lady of Allerdale, made patron&#8747; of the re&#392;tory; upon which, about the reign of King John, they di&#8747;&#8747;olved the ho&#8747;pital, and endowed the church with the land&#8747; belonging to it. In the reign of Henry III. one John Francigena, or French, kin&#8747;man of Gilbert Françoi&#8747;, or French, Lord of Routhcliff, wa&#8747; par&#8747;on of Caldbeck, and procured a large inclo&#8747;ure upon the adjoining hill, which i&#8747; called Warnel-Fell; but the Monk&#8747; of Holm-Cultram now interfered, and rai&#8747;ed &#8747;uch a litigation with re&#8747;peçt to hi&#8747; right to thi&#8747; parcel, that he wa&#8747; glad, for the &#8747;ake of peace, to con&#8747;ign half of it to them. A&#8747; memorial&#8747; of the&#8747;e affair&#8747;, there &#8747;till remain &#8747;everal name&#8747; of place&#8747; in and about Caldbeck, &#8747;uch a&#8747; that of Friar-Hall, and of Par&#8747;on-Park, or of the inclo&#8747;ure upon Warnell-Fell that ha&#8747; already been mentioned.</p>
<p>&#8747;o much for the &#8747;oil and it&#8747; fir&#8747;t cultivation. It will probably be &#8747;aid, that in &#8747;uch circum&#8747;tance&#8747; agriculture mu&#8747;t be in a &#8747;tate much inferior to that of the other countie&#8747; of England; nor i&#8747; thi&#8747; wholly without foundation: but the la&#8747;t twenty year&#8747; have introduced a mighty change; and the pre&#8747;ent &#8747;pirit of improvement and indu&#8747;try bid&#8747; fair for obliterating every &#8747;uch di&#8747;tin&#392;tion, at lea&#8747;t a&#8747; far a&#8747; the nature of the country will allow.</p>
<p>I pa&#8747;&#8747; next to &#8747;ome ob&#8747;ervation&#8747; on the wind&#8747; and weather of the vicinity of the&#8747;e Lake&#8747;; with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to which, though nothing may offer different from what may be found in other mountainou&#8747; part&#8747; of Britain, yet, a&#8747; I &#8747;aid before, I do not con&#8747;ider them on that account le&#8747;&#8747; worthy of notice. I do not mean by wind&#8747; &#8747;uch a&#8747; blow from particular quarter&#8747;, a&#8747; if any &#8747;uch prevailed here more than el&#8747;ewhere, but tho&#8747;e agitation&#8747; of the air, or of &#8747;omething el&#8747;e, which are known by the name&#8747; of <i>Bottom-Wind</i>, <i>Bo&#8747;om-Wind</i>, <i>and Helm-Wind</i>.</p>
<p>The Bottom-Wind ha&#8747; it&#8747; name from being &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed formerly, by the country people, to ari&#8747;e from the bottom of tho&#8747;e lake&#8747; which are &#8747;ituated among&#8747;t mountain&#8747;, for I know of none in a level country troubled with it. It i&#8747; indeed puzzling enough to

conceive why, in a day when hardly a &#8747;ingle breeze i&#8747; a-&#8747;tir, the &#8747;urface of a lake, which i&#8747; a&#8747; &#8747;mooth a&#8747; a mirror, &#8747;hould, without any apparent cau&#8747;e, begin to be in motion, which in le&#8747;&#8747; than an hour ri&#8747;e&#8747; to a con&#8747;iderable &#8747;well, with a dire&#392;tion &#8747;ometime&#8747; to one quarter and &#8747;ometime&#8747; to another; yet &#8747;uch i&#8747; really the ca&#8747;e, and &#8747;imilar appearance&#8747; have been ob&#8747;erved in &#8747;ome of the Alpine lake&#8747;, though it ha&#8747; been imputed a&#8747; a lie to Buchannan, that he tell&#8747; of a &#8747;imilar ph&#230;nomenon being frequent in the lake of Lennox. I have formed a theory to account for it, but a&#8747; I have not had the opportunity of making a &#8747;ufficient number of ob&#8747;ervation&#8747;, &#8747;hall omit it here.</p>
<p>The Bo&#8747;om-Wind i&#8747; quite a different affair, and take&#8747; place wherever one obje&#392;t in the dire&#392;tion of the wind overlook&#8747; another, or univer&#8747;ally where any thing break&#8747; the current of the air that would otherwi&#8747;e impinge dire&#392;tly on the obje&#392;t&#8747; beyond it; thi&#8747; i&#8747; particularly the ca&#8747;e where large rock&#8747; &#8747;creen thing&#8747; below them from the dire&#392;t force of the wind, yet &#8747;ubje&#392;t them to what i&#8747; called a Bo&#8747;om-Wind. Near the &#8747;ource&#8747; of the Caldew i&#8747; a valley called &#8747;wine&#8747;ide, never vi&#8747;ited by the ray&#8747; of the &#8747;un during the Winter month&#8747;: on the northern &#8747;ide of the hill which over&#8747;hadow&#8747; it in thi&#8747; manner, and at a con&#8747;iderable height above the valley, i&#8747; a pretty large ba&#8747;on of water, called Booth-&#8747;cale-tarn; three fourth&#8747; of which i&#8747; &#8747;urrounded either by an exceedingly &#8747;teep heath, or by entire rock&#8747;, and the other fourth, being the &#8747;ide right above the valley, give&#8747; an outlet to the water. A road lead&#8747; from the low ground&#8747; to thi&#8747; lake, and from the outlet wind&#8747; above half round it, gradually a&#8747;cending to &#8747;ome rock&#8747; where are &#8747;late-quarrie&#8747;, on account of which it wa&#8747; fir&#8747;t made; near the&#8747;e quarrie&#8747; the road i&#8747; a con&#8747;iderable height above the lake, and the perpendicular height of the hill above it cannot be le&#8747;&#8747; than four hundred yard&#8747;; on the other &#8747;ide of thi&#8747; height the de&#8747;cent i&#8747; at an angle of perhap&#8747; fifty degree&#8747;, but on thi&#8747; at a much greater. On a wet and windy day, in Autumn, I once took a ride with two companion&#8747; to thi&#8747; lake: the wind blew dire&#392;tly over the height which I mentioned, not &#8747;triking upon u&#8747; except in uncertain puff&#8747;, on account of the intervention of the hill; that i&#8747;, the wind, inpinging on the inclined plane of the other &#8747;ide of the hill, wa&#8747; compelled, toward&#8747; the &#8747;ummit of it, in an oblique dire&#392;tion, it&#8747; power&#8747; continually increa&#8747;ing, and it&#8747;elf being more and more conden&#8747;ed by the addition of fre&#8747;h air pre&#8747;&#8747;ing on it&#8747; cour&#8747;e in a &#8747;imilar diverted manner. Thi&#8747; current at the &#8747;ummit met with the regular wind, and after &#8747;triking violently on the ma&#8747;&#8747; of air moving in higher region&#8747;, wa&#8747;, by mean&#8747; of a combination of the weight and motion of that air, at la&#8747;t repelled into the tranquil and &#8747;tagnant air beneath, where there wa&#8747; not a re&#8747;i&#8747;tance from motion, and thu&#8747; occa&#8747;ioned the wind of which I am &#8747;peaking. It wa&#8747; thi&#8747; wind which amu&#8747;ed me very much at that time: I wa&#8747; looking at the lake beneath, and &#8747;aw it grow black near the center; the &#8747;pot where thi&#8747; fir&#8747;t appeared changed dire&#392;tly into a livid appearance, by being contra&#8747;ted with the re&#8747;t of the water, through which from thi&#8747; &#8747;pot, a&#8747; a fixed point, rolled concentric circle&#8747; of wave&#8747; toward&#8747; the circumference in a <unclear/> manner, whil&#8747;t the center it&#8747;elf remained quite &#8747;mooth and undi&#8747;turbed. The wind which produced thi&#8747; agitation immediately after a&#8747;cended the &#8747;ide&#8747; on the ba&#8747;on, and affe&#392;ted u&#8747; with very great force; I could al&#8747;o ob&#8747;erve the heath on the other &#8747;ide&#8747; of the pool &#8747;hook by the &#8747;ame, and in the &#8747;ame main dire&#392;tion from a ... very forcibly. &#8747;uch wa&#8747; the effe&#392;t&#8747; that I ob&#8747;erved: I am told, however, that other&#8747; have known a wind of the &#8747;ame kind, in dry weather, &#8747;natch the water out of the pool, and &#8747;catter it a&#8747; &#8747;pray through the whole of thi&#8747; impri&#8747;oned &#8747;pace.</p>
<p>A&#8747; I am now to &#8747;peak of the Helm-Wind, it may be nece&#8747;&#8747;ary, for the &#8747;ake of tho&#8747;e reader&#8747; who have not &#8747;een any thing of the kind, to premi&#8747;e, that Cro&#8747;&#8747;-fell i&#8747; one-continued ridge, &#8747;tretching without any branche&#8747;, or even &#8747;ubje&#392;t to mountain&#8747;, except two or three conical hill&#8747; called Pike&#8747;, from the N.N.W. to the &#8747;.&#8747;.F. from the neighbourhood of Gill&#8747;land almo&#8747;t to Kirkby-&#8747;teven, that i&#8747; above 40 mile&#8747;.

Or, again, if we con&#8747;ider it&#8747; va&#8747;t bulk, which notwith&#8747;tanding &#8747;till repre&#8747;ent&#8747; the form of the mountain (corre&#8747;ponding with it&#8747; elevation&#8747; and depre&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747;) &#8747;o that the bolde&#8747;t head of Cro&#8747;&#8747;-fell, which i&#8747; &#8747;omewhat to the northward of the middle part of it&#8747; range, i&#8747; &#8747;till di&#8747;tingui&#8747;hable even in it&#8747; <i>Helm</i>; for &#8747;uch i&#8747; the name of that heap of vapour from whence the wind of which we are treating i&#8747;&#8747;ue&#8747;. When thi&#8747; heap fir&#8747;t gather&#8747; upon the hill, there i&#8747; &#8747;een above it a black &#8747;treak of cloud continually flying off, and continually fed from the white one, which i&#8747; the real <i>Helm</i>: thi&#8747; i&#8747; called the <i>Helm-bar</i>, from it&#8747; being &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed to bar or ob&#8747;tru&#392;t the wind&#8747; that bur&#8747;t forth upon the vallie&#8747; beneath a&#8747; &#8747;oon a&#8747; it wholly vani&#8747;he&#8747;: it&#8747; dire&#392;tion i&#8747; parallel to that of the white cloud, and it &#8747;eem&#8747; in continual motion, a&#8747; if boiling, or at lea&#8747;t agitated by a violent wind; and indeed the wind which really doe&#8747; follow it&#8747; removal i&#8747; &#8747;ometime&#8747; prodigiou&#8747; violent, varying with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to the extent of territory which it affe&#392;t&#8747;, in proportion to the force and dire&#392;tion of what I &#8747;hall here call the Real Wind&#8747;. &#8747;ometime&#8747; when the&#8747;e are it&#8747; dire&#392;t antagoni&#8747;t&#8747;, and in full force, it doe&#8747; not reach further than two or three mile&#8747;; nor do I know, that, even without &#8747;uch impediment, it ever extend&#8747; further than thirteen or fourteen; being interrupted in it&#8747; progre&#8747;&#8747; by the vi&#8747; inerti&#230; of the air at large, or by &#8747;ome cau&#8747;e ari&#8747;ing from the impul&#8747;e of contrary current&#8747;. However, though it alway&#8747; bear&#8747; a certain proportion to the force and dire&#392;tion of the real wind&#8747;, it&#8747; own intrin&#8747;ic force i&#8747; not alway&#8747; equal, nor i&#8747; it found &#8747;o, even at the foot of the hill; where, on account of the &#8747;hortne&#8747;&#8747; of it&#8747; cour&#8747;e, the a&#392;tion of contrary current&#8747;, or the re&#8747;i&#8747;tance of the air, cannot be &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed to have had any material effe&#392;t in changing the degree of it&#8747; power, or of interrupting it&#8747; progre&#8747;&#8747;. It may however be remembered a&#8747; a truth, that, near the ba&#8747;e of the mountain, it i&#8747; at time&#8747; exce&#8747;&#8747;ively &#8747;trong, bearing almo&#8747;t every thing before it, though at the di&#8747;tance of a very few mile&#8747; not felt at all.</p> 
<p>&#8747;uch i&#8747; the Helm-Wind generated in that enormou&#8747; cloud, which, like a helmet, cover&#8747; the &#8747;ummit of Cro&#8747;&#8747;-fell. It i&#8747; here particularly favoured by circum&#8747;tance&#8747;; for on one &#8747;ide there i&#8747; a plain of above thirty mile&#8747; in breadth in &#8747;ome place&#8747;, and on the other no hill&#8747; to rival that from whence it come&#8747;. Thi&#8747; wind i&#8747; not much taken notice of in natural hi&#8747;tory; yet the Dutch, by the iron chain&#8747; with which they are obliged to moor their &#8747;hip&#8747; at the Cape of Good-Hope, bear ample te&#8747;timony to the fury of &#8747;uch an one. It hath been met with by late voyager&#8747; in the &#8747;outh-&#8747;ea&#8747;; it i&#8747; &#8747;aid to have been felt in the &#8747;trait&#8747; of Gibraltar; and I doubt not but mariner&#8747; and traveller&#8747; have found it in many other place&#8747;, though they may not have ob&#8747;erved it with care, or may have given it different name&#8747;. I apprehend that the land-breeze in the We&#8747;t Indie&#8747;, though le&#8747;&#8747; violent and more regular, i&#8747; &#8747;imilar to it; and I doubt not but there may be a helm-wind from almo&#8747;t every hill covered with a cloud in certain kind&#8747;
<pb n="xli"/>
kind&#8747; of weather, though the re&#8747;i&#8747;tance of &#8747;imilar wind&#8747; from neighbouring hill&#8747; may prevent it&#8747; being taken notice of.</p>
<p>It may be remarked of thi&#8747; wind, that it generally blow&#8747; from Cro&#8747;&#8747;-Fell longe&#8747;t in the &#8747;pring, when the &#8747;un ha&#8747; &#8747;omewhat warmed the air beneath, and doe&#8747; not cea&#8747;e till it ha&#8747; effe&#392;tually cooled it: thu&#8747; it &#8747;ometime&#8747; continue&#8747; for a fortnight or three week&#8747;, which I con&#8747;ider a&#8747; a peculiarity of the Helm-Wind of Cro&#8747;&#8747;-Fell. A&#8747; &#8747;uch therefore, though I have not lei&#8747;ure to attempt the di&#8747;cu&#8747;&#8747;ion of it&#8747; variou&#8747; ph&#230;nomena, &#8747;uch a&#8747; that of the bar, <i>&#38;c.</i> I hope &#8747;hall not do a thing unplea&#8747;ant to the philo&#8747;ophic reader, if I attempt to give an account of it&#8747; general cau&#8747;e, which I &#8747;hall do on the following &#8747;imple principle&#8747;.</p>
<p>The chymi&#8747;t&#8747; know, that evaporation produce&#8747; cold, and that of &#230;ther i&#8747; remarkable enough. To tho&#8747;e who have not &#8747;een their method, or heard of it, I &#8747;hall mention that of the brewer&#8747;, who throw quick-lime into their large cauldron&#8747; when they want to cool them &#8747;uddenly; and the effe&#392;t, I apprehend, depend&#8747; upon &#8747;imilar principle&#8747;, though exhibited in a different manner: any man, however, may have a cheap proof of the cold produced by evaporation, by plunging hi&#8747; hand into water, and holding it up to the &#8747;un or wind, or both, at any &#8747;ea&#8747;on, to dry. Even waving all the&#8747;e a&#8747; cau&#8747;e&#8747; of the cold to be expe&#392;ted from vapour&#8747;, the fog&#8747; hovering upon river&#8747; are a &#8747;en&#8747;ible proof that the thing i&#8747; &#8747;o; which any one mu&#8747;t have experienced &#8747;till more forcibly, who ha&#8747; met with a rainy cloud, or a mere fog, upon the mountain&#8747; in warm weather, and will have felt that &#8747;uch a cloud, even at a di&#8747;tance, can obtrude a piercing cold upon the warme&#8747;t day in &#8747;ummer. Now, whether it i&#8747; by attra&#392;tion, (which I think it i&#8747;,) or any thing el&#8747;e, that hill&#8747; detain cloud&#8747; which wander in the region of their &#8747;ummit&#8747;, belong&#8747; not to my purpo&#8747;e, &#8747;ince it i&#8747; a thing known univer&#8747;ally to exi&#8747;t wherever there are hill&#8747;: and Cro&#8747;&#8747;-fell, probably from it&#8747; va&#8747;t length, height, and loneline&#8747;&#8747;, i&#8747; peculiarly powerful in detaining them; for it intercept&#8747; many, and there i&#8747; no hill near who&#8747;e attra&#392;tion, or effe&#392;t&#8747; upon the wind&#8747;, <i>&#38;c.</i> may &#8747;erve to remove them: thu&#8747; they gather not into that &#8747;hadowy indi&#8747;criminate ma&#8747;&#8747; of vapour&#8747; which &#8747;ettle on hill&#8747; before and during rain&#8747;, but &#8747;uch a&#8747; I have de&#8747;cribed. It will be ea&#8747;ily conceived, from what it premi&#8747;ed, that &#8747;uch an a&#8747;&#8747;embly of vapour&#8747; will produce a proportional degree of cold around it; wherea&#8747; the height of any hill&#8747; in Britain, without &#8747;uch a cau&#8747;e, or a bri&#8747;k wind, i&#8747; not &#8747;ufficient to produce any great degree of it. I have felt a &#8747;uffocating warmth on the top&#8747; of &#8747;ome of the highe&#8747;t of them in a calm day, even when drift&#8747; of &#8747;now &#8747;till remained, and were far beneath me. &#8747;uch cold, therefore, mu&#8747;t occa&#8747;ion a corre&#8747;ponding den&#8747;ity in that portion of air on which it operate&#8747;; and when the &#8747;un, by that more-continued a&#392;tion of hi&#8747; ray&#8747; which belong&#8747; to valley&#8747;, ha&#8747; warmed the air in the country beneath in the day, or left it &#8747;o in the evening, that air mu&#8747;t be proportionally rarified; and becoming lighter than that in a higher region, or a lea&#8747;t lighter with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to it&#8747; &#8747;ituation, the equilibrium which fluid&#8747; wi&#8747;h to pre&#8747;erve will con&#8747;equently be interrupted: the higher air will thenceforward ru&#8747;h down to keep up thi&#8747; equilibrium, and in it&#8747; cour&#8747;e occa&#8747;ion the wind of which we are &#8747;peaking.</p> 
<p>I believe thi&#8747; account will corre&#8747;pond with all the circum&#8747;tance&#8747; attending the Helm-Wind of Cro&#8747;&#8747;-Fell. I think it nece&#8747;&#8747;ary to mention again, that it blow&#8747; until it ha&#8747; entirely cooled the air of the adjoining country, (for it&#8747;elf i&#8747; very chill,) and i&#8747; almo&#8747;t alway&#8747; terminated by a rain, which re&#8747;tore&#8747;, or to which &#8747;ucceed&#8747; a general warmth, and into which the Helm &#8747;eem&#8747; to re&#8747;olve it&#8747;elf.</p>
<p>It may be al&#8747;o an amu&#8747;ement to the traveller, to take notice of the old-fa&#8747;hioned mode&#8747; of foretelling the different kind&#8747; of weather yet in u&#8747;e among&#8747;t the ru&#8747;tic&#8747; of every part, notwith&#8747;tanding the general introdu&#392;tion of barometer&#8747;; for it i&#8747; by the&#8747;e only that they know, with any degree of certainty, what the ri&#8747;ing or falling of the mercury indicate&#8747;. The inhabitant&#8747; of every mountainou&#8747; tra&#392;t have greater number&#8747; of

them than tho&#8747;e of the plain&#8747;, becau&#8747;e their weather i&#8747; &#8747;ubje&#392;t to greater and more numerou&#8747; variation&#8747;. Pliny ha&#8747; taken notice of many of tho&#8747;e &#8747;ign&#8747; which were in vogue among&#8747;t the Roman&#8747;; he ha&#8747;, however, done little more than copy them from Virgil: and it i&#8747; a thing not unworthy our curio&#8747;ity to ob&#8747;erve what a &#8747;imilarity there i&#8747; between the progno&#8747;tic&#8747; of countrie&#8747; &#8747;o remote from each other; a &#8747;imilarity which, however, prove&#8747; that they have both been founded on a &#8747;tri&#392;t ob&#8747;ervation of the nature of thing&#8747;, and that they carry along with them not a little of that authority which i&#8747; due to truth; though we can a&#8747;&#8747;ign no better rea&#8747;on for many of them at thi&#8747; day, than what Virgil ha&#8747; done in a truly philo&#8747;ophic manner, and the mo&#8747;t exqui&#8747;itely beautiful language. Thu&#8747; the &#8747;well of water&#8747; in the Firth&#8747;, the &#8747;ound from the mountain&#8747;, the deeper murmur of wood&#8747;, the motion&#8747; of &#8747;ea-Mew&#8747;, &#38;c. the lofty flight&#8747; of the Mo&#8747;&#8747;-Drum, Mire-Drumble or Bittern, the &#8747;hooting of &#8747;tar&#8747;, the mock-battle&#8747; of Crow&#8747;, and indeed almo&#8747;t all Virgil’&#8747; progno&#8747;tic&#8747;, with a great many more not mentioned by him, are &#8747;till taken notice of, and furni&#8747;h to the attentive ob&#8747;erver no incon&#8747;iderable knowledge of what i&#8747; to come. I will add to tho&#8747;e already mentioned, that appearance in the heaven&#8747; called Noah’&#8747; Ark; which being occa&#8747;ioned by a bri&#8747;k We&#8747;t-wind rolling together a large number of &#8747;mall bright cloud&#8747; into the form of a &#8747;hip’&#8747; hull, and exhibiting a beautiful mottled texture, i&#8747; pointed North and &#8747;outh, and &#8747;aid to be an infallible &#8747;ign of rain to happen within twenty-four hour&#8747;.</p>
<p>Thu&#8747; have I fini&#8747;hed what I intended to &#8747;ay a&#8747; prefatory to the de&#8747;cription&#8747; inlcuded in thi&#8747; Work. I acknowledge that my principal meaning in the hint&#8747; which I have thrown out, and the ob&#8747;ervation&#8747; which I have made, ha&#8747; been to &#8747;timulate other&#8747; who&#8747;e lei&#8747;ure and abilitie&#8747; are greater, and who&#8747;e opportunitie&#8747; of information may be more exten&#8747;ive, to pro&#8747;ecute tho&#8747;e, or &#8747;imilar &#8747;ubje&#392;t&#8747;, on a larger &#8747;cale: for I am fully per&#8747;uaded, that a great deal of good information remain&#8747; yet to be gathered, and may with ea&#8747;e be colle&#392;ted in the&#8747;e part&#8747;, not only by the inquirer after ancient manner&#8747;, but by the Etymologi&#8747;t, the Grammarian, the Hi&#8747;torian of the work&#8747; both of men and nature, the Antiquarian with re&#8747;pe&#392;t to in&#8747;cription&#8747; and coin&#8747;, the Botani&#8747;t, and the Painter. A&#8747; to my&#8747;elf, it i&#8747; nece&#8747;&#8747;ary further to acknowledge, that being obliged, in thi&#8747; part of the Work, to quote principally from memory, I may po&#8747;&#8747;ibly have fallen into &#8747;ome inaccuracie&#8747;. That being immer&#8747;ed in bu&#8747;ine&#8747;&#8747; of a very different nature, and applying to thi&#8747; only at &#8747;tolen interval&#8747;, there will be found in the &#8747;tile a &#8747;ort of inequality, which the human mind, from it&#8747; different aptitude and vigour at different &#8747;ea&#8747;on&#8747;, and after different degree&#8747; of exerci&#8747;e, cannot prevent: and that from thinking on &#8747;ome of the &#8747;ubje&#392;t&#8747;, I may po&#8747;&#8747;ibly here and there have been led, a&#8747; it were by &#8747;ympathy, to the u&#8747;e of quaint or ob&#8747;olete expre&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747;, and may not have pre&#8747;erved that cla&#8747;&#8747;ical purity of language which I could have wi&#8747;hed. I am con&#8747;ciou&#8747; al&#8747;o, that my arrangement&#8747; may be found fault with; and to thi&#8747; charge I mu&#8747;t an&#8747;wer, that not intending, when I &#8747;et forward, to write any regular e&#8747;&#8747;ay, nor ought further than few cur&#8747;ory note&#8747;, I paid no attention to that circum&#8747;tance; till one idea calling forth other&#8747;, and tho&#8747;e in their turn&#8747; giving birth to fre&#8747;h one&#8747;, I began to &#8747;tartle at the bulk of thi&#8747; Introdu&#392;tion, deficient a&#8747; it i&#8747; in form and order, and forthwith endeavoured to contra&#392;t my ob&#8747;ervation&#8747; into a&#8747; little room a&#8747; po&#8747;&#8747;ible. I mu&#8747;t al&#8747;o frankly own, that the nece&#8747;&#8747;ity of publi&#8747;hing the Whole Work a&#8747; &#8747;oon a&#8747; po&#8747;&#8747;ible, on account of the delay&#8747; it ha&#8747; already met with, utterly prevent&#8747; me from tran&#8747;cribing it in a more corre&#392;t form, and compel&#8747; me to pre&#8747;ent the fir&#8747;t copy of thi&#8747; to the Public. &#8747;uch therefore a&#8747; it i&#8747;, I hope, that if any new information i&#8747; furni&#8747;hed by it, the fault&#8747;, which mu&#8747;t from the circum&#8747;tance&#8747; of it&#8747; execution be attached to it, will be overlooked and forgiven.</p>

<p>I &#8747;HALL begin my ob&#8747;ervation&#8747; at the <i>Counte&#8747;&#8747;’&#8747; Pillar</i>, where likewi&#8747;e my plan&#8747; commence: I &#8747;hall, however, exceed thi&#8747; bound, to take notice of a very large Oak Tree in Whinfield-Park, called the <i>Hart&#8747;-horn Tree</i>. Concerning thi&#8747; tree there i&#8747; a tradition, confirmed by Anne Counte&#8747;&#8747; of Pembroke in her memoir&#8747;, that an hart wa&#8747; run by a &#8747;ingle dog from thi&#8747; place to <i>Red-Kirk</i> in &#8747;cotland and back again: when they came near thi&#8747; tree the hart leaped the wall, but the dog, worn out with fatigue, wa&#8747; unable to follow him, and died there; the hart, equally fatigued, could proceed no farther, and in thi&#8747; &#8747;ituation they were found by the hunter&#8747;, the dog dead on one &#8747;ide of the wall, and the deer on the other. In memory of thi&#8747; remarkable chace, the hart’&#8747; horn&#8747; were fixed upon thi&#8747; tree, whence it obtained it&#8747; name; and a&#8747; all extraordinary event&#8747; were in tho&#8747;e day&#8747; recorded in rhyme&#8747; we find the following popular one upon thi&#8747; occa&#8747;ion, from which we learn the dog’&#8747; name likewi&#8747;e:</p>

<p>Thi&#8747; &#8747;tory appear&#8747; to have been literally true, a&#8747; the &#8747;cot&#8747; pre&#8747;erve it without any variation, and add, that it happened in the year 1333 or 1334, when Edward Baliol King of &#8747;cot&#8747; came to hunt with Robert de Clifford in hi&#8747; domain&#8747; at Appleby and Brougham. I cannot, however, help thinking the Counte&#8747;&#8747; i&#8747; mi&#8747;taken in calling the dog a Grey-Hound, a&#8747; he mu&#8747;t have run upward&#8747; of 80 mile&#8747;, even &#8747;uppo&#8747;ing the deer to have taken the dire&#392;t road; and thi&#8747; no one, who i&#8747; acquainted with the nature of dog&#8747;, can &#8747;uppo&#8747;e a grey-hound capable of performing.</p>
<p>We now come to the Counte&#8747;&#8747;’&#8747; Pillar, which i&#8747; twelve feet high, and built of hewn &#8747;tone: it ha&#8747; a large quadrangular capital, each of who&#8747;e face&#8747; an&#8747;wer&#8747; to one of the cardinal point&#8747;. On the Ea&#8747;t, We&#8747;t and &#8747;outh, are dial&#8747;, and on the North, the following in&#8747;cription:</p> 
<p>“ Thi&#8747; Pillar wa&#8747; ere&#392;ted A.D. 1656, by the Right Honourable Anne Counte&#8747;&#8747; of “ Pembroke, and &#8747;ole heir of the Right Honourable George Earl of Cumberland, for “ a memorial of her la&#8747;t parting, in thi&#8747; place, with her good and piou&#8747; mother the “ Right Honourable Margaret Counte&#8747;&#8747; Dowager of Cumberland, the 2d of April “ 1616. In memory whereof &#8747;he ha&#8747; left an annuity of <i>L</i>. 4 to be di&#8747;tributed to the “ poor within the Pari&#8747;h of Brougham, every 2d day of April for ever, upon the &#8747;tone “ hereby. Lau&#8747; Deo."
Thi&#8747; money wa&#8747; &#8747;ecured to be paid out of certain land&#8747; at Brougham; but afterward&#8747;, when tho&#8747;e land&#8747; came into the po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion of Jame&#8747; Bird, he tran&#8747;ferred the &#8747;ecurity to &#8747;ome land&#8747; at Yanwath.</p>

Like mo&#8747;t of our Northern &#8747;trong-hold&#8747;, thi&#8747; ca&#8747;tle i&#8747; built in a &#8747;quare form, with it&#8747; &#8747;ide&#8747; facing the cardinal point&#8747;; three of which have been defended by a ditch, and the other (the North &#8747;ide) i&#8747; clo&#8747;e to the river Emont. No place can exhibit more &#8747;triking remain&#8747; of that gloomy &#8747;trength for which the&#8747;e edifice&#8747; of defence were &#8747;o remarkable; arched vault&#8747;, winding pa&#8747;&#8747;age&#8747; in the wall&#8747;, &#8747;o narrow a&#8747; not to admit more than one per&#8747;on at once; the door&#8747; to the&#8747;e pa&#8747;&#8747;age&#8747; contra&#392;ted to a mere hole, through which no one can enter without &#8747;tooping; and the remain&#8747; of va&#8747;t bolt&#8747; and ma&#8747;&#8747;y hinge&#8747;, give u&#8747; a lively idea of tho&#8747;e time&#8747; of danger and jealou&#8747;y, when the lord wa&#8747; almo&#8747;t a pri&#8747;oner in hi&#8747; own ca&#8747;tle.</p>
<p>&#8747;ome of the&#8747;e vault&#8747; and hole&#8747; are a&#8747; curiou&#8747; a&#8747; they are difficult of acce&#8747;&#8747;; one of which contain&#8747; what i&#8747; called the &#8747;weating Pillar, from it&#8747; being continually covered with a moi&#8747;ture or dew. Thi&#8747; vault &#8747;hould appear to have been the dungeon or keep where pri&#8747;oner&#8747; were confined, and i&#8747; &#8747;ituated under the main body of the building; it&#8747; wall&#8747; are four or five yard&#8747; thick, through which are &#8747;everal dark pa&#8747;&#8747;age&#8747;, &#8747;ome open, other&#8747; blocked up. In the centre &#8747;tand&#8747; the pillar, which, at it&#8747; top, where it reache&#8747; the roof of the vault, divide&#8747; it&#8747;elf into eight branche&#8747;; the&#8747;e branche&#8747; are refle&#392;ted along the curvature of the vault, like the arm&#8747; of a tree; thu&#8747; pre&#8747;erving, even in a dungeon, the true Gothic &#8747;tile of archite&#392;ture. The extremitie&#8747; of the&#8747;e branche&#8747; terminate near the ground in deformed head&#8747; of animal&#8747;, &#8747;uch a&#8747; we con&#8747;tantly &#8747;ee in the building&#8747; of our ance&#8747;tor&#8747;; and each of the&#8747;e head&#8747; hold&#8747; in it&#8747; mouth an iron ring, probably intended for the chaining of unruly and riotou&#8747; pri&#8747;oner&#8747;. Part of the roof i&#8747; now broken, and that &#8747;ide of the pillar oppo&#8747;ite to the breach i&#8747; now become dry, which furni&#8747;he&#8747; u&#8747; with a &#8747;olution of the ph&#230;nomenon of the &#8747;weating.</p>

For thi&#8747; he quote&#8747; Antonine, who place&#8747; the Brovoniacum 20 Italian mile&#8747; from Verter&#230;: nor i&#8747; it improbable that the foundation of thi&#8747; Ca&#8747;tle wa&#8747; laid by the Roman&#8747;, a&#8747; the Roman cau&#8747;eway which lead&#8747; from Carli&#8747;le, by the <i>Ala Petriana</i>, pa&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747; thi&#8747; place, Kirkby Thore<ptr target="n1"/>, and Brough, under &#8747;tainmore.</p>
<note id="n1">Kirby-Thore lye&#8747; about a mile from Temple-&#8747;owerby, and i&#8747; a place of very great antiquity; it had it&#8747; name from a Temple of the &#8747;axon god Thor, (or Jupiter) which &#8747;tood near it, the ruin&#8747; whereof may be traced to thi&#8747; day.

<p>The fir&#8747;t authentic hi&#8747;torical account we have of thi&#8747; Ca&#8747;tle i&#8747; in the reign of William the Conqueror, who granted it, and the e&#8747;tate belonging to it, together with the Barony of We&#8747;tmorland, to Hugh de Abrinoi&#8747;. Thi&#8747; Hugh de Abrinoi&#8747;, (who wa&#8747; &#8747;urnamed Lupu&#8747;, and wa&#8747; the &#8747;on of a &#8747;i&#8747;ter of the Conqueror’&#8747;,) and hi&#8747; &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;or&#8747;, held it till the year 1170, when it wa&#8747; forfeited by Hugh de Morville<ptr target="n2"/>. King John afterward&#8747; granted thi&#8747; Ca&#8747;tle, together with Appleby, to Robert de Veteripont or Vipont, the &#8747;on of Maud, daughter of Hugh de Morville: but Robert, the grand&#8747;on of thi&#8747; Robert, e&#8747;pou&#8747;ing the cau&#8747;e of Montfort Earl of Leice&#8747;ter, forfeited hi&#8747; e&#8747;tate&#8747;, which however were re&#8747;tored to I&#8747;abella and Ivetta, or Idonea, hi&#8747; two daughter&#8747;. They being minor&#8747; were in ward&#8747;hip to the King, who delegated thi&#8747; tru&#8747;t to Roger de Clifford of Clifford-Ca&#8747;tle in Hereford&#8747;hire, and Roger de Leybourne of the County of Kent: the&#8747;e guardian&#8747; afterward&#8747; married them to their two &#8747;on&#8747; Roger de Clifford and Roger de Leybourne. Idonea, who wa&#8747; married to Roger de Leybourne, died without i&#8747;&#8747;ue, but I&#8747;abella became the mother of the illu&#8747;triou&#8747; family of the Clifford&#8747;.

After the death of Earl Thoma&#8747;, hi&#8747; &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;or, &#8747;ackville Tufton, had a quarrel with hi&#8747; tenant&#8747; about their fine&#8747;, upon which a trial at bar by a &#8747;pecial jury wa&#8747; dire&#392;ted in the year 1739; during the trial, eleven witne&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747; were produced who&#8747;e age&#8747; together amounted to a thou&#8747;and year&#8747;. A rare and plea&#8747;ing in&#8747;tance of longevity; owing, no doubt, to the con&#8747;tant temperance, pure air, and healthful exerci&#8747;e in which our Cumbrian mountaineer&#8747; uniformly live.</p>
<note id="n2">Hugh de Morville wa&#8747; one of the Knight&#8747; who murdered Thoma&#8747; á Becket.

<p>Thi&#8747; Ca&#8747;tle hath varied it&#8747; &#8747;trength and beauty almo&#8747;t a&#8747; much a&#8747; it&#8747; po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;or&#8747;; for after the death of John Veteripont it went almo&#8747;t to ruin, hi&#8747; &#8747;on Robert being a minor and in ward to the Prior of Carli&#8747;le. It wa&#8747; afterward&#8747; repaired by Roger de Clifford; and when King Jame&#8747; the I. returned in the year 1617 from hi&#8747; la&#8747;t progre&#8747;&#8747; into &#8747;cotland, he wa&#8747; entertained at thi&#8747; Ca&#8747;tle by Franci&#8747; Earl of Cumberland. During the civil war&#8747; it wa&#8747; again demoli&#8747;hed; but wa&#8747; repaired in the year 1671 by Anne Counte&#8747;&#8747; of Pembroke, who built a garden-wall on the &#8747;outh-Ea&#8747;t &#8747;ide of the building, a&#8747; appear&#8747; by a &#8747;tone over the garden-door. The garden wa&#8747; afterward&#8747; planted with wood; and the &#8747;tone, lead, and timber of thi&#8747; venerable edifice &#8747;old for <i>L</i>. 100 to Mr John Monkhou&#8747;e and Mr Adderton, two Attornie&#8747; in Penrith, who afterward&#8747; &#8747;old them in public &#8747;ale&#8747;, and the fir&#8747;t &#8747;ale wa&#8747; upon the &#8747;ame day that hi&#8747; Maje&#8747;ty George the I. wa&#8747; crowned: the old wain&#8747;cotting being chiefly purcha&#8747;ed by the neighbouring villager&#8747;, many curiou&#8747; piece&#8747; of carved work are yet to be &#8747;een in their hou&#8747;e&#8747;.</p>
<p>The e&#8747;tate wa&#8747; then almo&#8747;t wholly negle&#392;ted, no one re&#8747;iding upon it but a hind, who took in cattle by<ptr target="n3"/> &#8747;tint: he afterward&#8747; farmed it, together with Whinfield-Park, for <i>L</i>. 40 <i>per annum</i>, and po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ed it till the year 1767. The whole deme&#8747;ne wa&#8747; then a barren heath, &#8747;tocked with va&#8747;t number&#8747; of rabbit&#8747;, and a few deer; the&#8747;e &#8747;upplied the farmer and hi&#8747; family almo&#8747;t entirely with food: during the &#8747;ummer they ate veni&#8747;on, and during the Winter they ate the rabbit&#8747;.</p>
<note id="n3">&#8747;tint &#8747;ignifie&#8747;, that the cattle taken into any particular &#8747;pot of ground &#8747;hall not exceed a certain number.</note>
<p>&#8747;ince the year 1767 Whinfield-Park ha&#8747; been divided into farm&#8747;, and the&#8747;e again &#8747;ubdivided; the rabbit&#8747; de&#8747;troyed, and the deer circum&#8747;cribed in narrower bound&#8747;; by which mean&#8747; the red deer are much dimini&#8747;hed in number. Thu&#8747; we &#8747;ee a &#8747;pot of ground, formerly a barren heath, now become rich fruitful land; and what twenty year&#8747; ago wa&#8747; not worth more than forty pound&#8747; a year<ptr target="n4"/>, now cheaply let for upward&#8747; of a thou&#8747;and, and to add to it&#8747; advantage&#8747;, all tythe-free. Thi&#8747; immunity wa&#8747; obtained in the year 1775, when the a&#392;t obtained for dividing Brougham Moor empowered the Commi&#8747;&#8747;ioner&#8747; at the &#8747;ame time to allot to the Re&#392;tor certain land&#8747; in lieu of the tythe&#8747; both of the new and old inclo&#8747;ure&#8747;.</p>

<p>The next remarkable place upon the road i&#8747; Brougham-Hall, called till lately the Bird&#8747; Ne&#8747;t, the &#8747;eat of Henry Brougham, E&#8747;quire. Dr Burn call&#8747; thi&#8747; e&#8747;tate a Manor, but very erroneou&#8747;ly: it lye&#8747; within the manor of Oglebird&#8747;, and i&#8747; held of the Earl of Thanet a&#8747; part of the fore&#8747;t of Whinfield. Thi&#8747; wa&#8747; not well a&#8747;certained till after the divi&#8747;ion of the Common in 1775, when the Commi&#8747;&#8747;ioner&#8747; were dire&#392;ted to &#8747;et out &#8747;uch a proportion of ground a&#8747; they thought proper to H. Brougham E&#8747;q; for hi&#8747; &#8747;ignory of Brougham Hall. Mr Brougham made no claim, knowing he had no manor, and the Commi&#8747;&#8747;ioner&#8747;, upon inquiry, found that the manor belonged to the Earl of Thanet, and that the tenant&#8747; were all freeholder&#8747;: Mr Brougham therefore took hi&#8747; &#8747;hare among the other tenant&#8747;, without ever attempting to e&#8747;tabli&#8747;h any claim a&#8747; lord.</p>
<p>On the oppo&#8747;ite &#8747;ide of the road &#8747;tand&#8747; the Chapel, a low, old-fa&#8747;hioned building, founded by the Counte&#8747;&#8747; of Pembroke; it ha&#8747; no burying-ground, and &#8747;ervice i&#8747; performed there only once a fortnight.</p>
<p>The family of the Brougham&#8747; i&#8747; &#8747;aid to have originally come from Burd-O&#8747;wald in Gillyland, but have been &#8747;ettled here a long time: their man&#8747;ion i&#8747; plea&#8747;antly &#8747;ituated, and command&#8747; a good pro&#8747;pe&#392;t: the garden&#8747;, though &#8747;mall, are neatly laid out; but &#8747;ince the death of the late po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;or, have been out of repair, the pre&#8747;ent owner, H.

<p>We next come to Lowther Bridge, built over the river Lowther at a place called Bradwath in the boundary-roll&#8747; both of the manor of Brougham and Clifton. I am in po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion of an old boundary-roll (taken at the perambulation of Gilbert de Engayne, in the 21&#8747;t year of Edward the III. at which time he &#8747;ettled the whole village of Clifton upon hi&#8747; &#8747;on Henry, and Johanna<ptr target="n5"/> hi&#8747; wife) and thi&#8747; likewi&#8747;e begin&#8747; at Bradwath.

<p>From the Bridge part of the village of Clifton may be &#8747;een; more particularly the church, and that old tower called the Hall, at the di&#8747;tance of about three quarter&#8747; of a mile. Thi&#8747; village, (which con&#8747;i&#8747;t&#8747; of about forty hou&#8747;e&#8747;, all very neat,) formerly belonged to Hugh de Morville, and wa&#8747; given by him to Gilbert de Engayne before the forfeiture of hi&#8747; other e&#8747;tate&#8747;. In the family of the Engayne&#8747; it continued until the marriage of Elinora, the only daughter of the family, to William Wybergh, and in the Wybergh family it hath ever &#8747;ince continued. During the civil war&#8747; they fell into di&#8747;tre&#8747;&#8747; through the oppre&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747; of tho&#8747;e time&#8747;, when the manor of Clifton wa&#8747; mortgaged to &#8747;ir John Lowther of Lowther, and never afterward&#8747; redeemed. The pre&#8747;ent po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;or i&#8747; Thoma&#8747; Wybergh E&#8747;q; Coun&#8747;ellor at law.</p>

Bee&#8747; with man and hor&#8747;e, to fetch &#8747;alt and other nece&#8747;&#8747;arie&#8747; from thence, once “ a year." They had a right to compound for thi&#8747; &#8747;ervice, by paying half a crown to

the Bailiff when he went to warn them; and it i&#8747; hardly nece&#8747;&#8747;ary to ob&#8747;erve, that the Bailiff knew perfe&#392;tly well how to time hi&#8747; &#8747;ummon&#8747;. &#8747;ome, however, cho&#8747;e rather to go than pay; and in that ca&#8747;e they had a &#8747;hilling each man from the lord, and at their return were to have bread and chee&#8747;e and ale at the lord’&#8747; expence. The la&#8747;t who went thi&#8747; journey wa&#8747; Henry Penrith, who brought &#8747;alt from &#8747;t Bee&#8747; at the &#8747;ummon&#8747; of John Lowther, to whom the manor wa&#8747; then mortgaged. Thi&#8747; may &#8747;hew u&#8747; how greatly money i&#8747; decrea&#8747;ed in value within a few year&#8747; in thi&#8747; county, a&#8747; (notwith&#8747;tanding the improvement&#8747; of the road,) the di&#8747;tance which tho&#8747;e who went to &#8747;t Bee&#8747; had to travel, i&#8747; forty-&#8747;even mile&#8747;; and before the&#8747;e improvement&#8747; took place, the journey mu&#8747;t have been not only longer, but very laboriou&#8747;.</p>
<p>Near the village i&#8747; Clifton-Moor, where a battle wa&#8747; fought between a part of the army under William Duke of Cumberland and the Rebel&#8747;, in the year 1745, at which time Lieutenant-Colonel, (afterward&#8747; Lieutenant-General) Honeywood<ptr target="n6"/> wa&#8747; de&#8747;perately wounded: he wa&#8747; taken up for dead, having received &#8747;everal wound&#8747; on hi&#8747; head; and hi&#8747; hat wa&#8747; cut through in nine &#8747;everal place&#8747;.</p>
<note id="n6">Thi&#8747; wa&#8747; not the only miraculou&#8747; e&#8747;cape of thi&#8747; brave officer: at the battle of Dettingen he received twenty-three broad-&#8747;word wound&#8747;, and two Mu&#8747;quet-&#8747;hot&#8747; which never were extra&#392;ted. He died A.D. 1785, and left hi&#8747; large e&#8747;tate&#8747;, to the amount of <i>L</i>. 6000 <i>per annum</i>, together with a very con&#8747;iderable per&#8747;onal property, to hi&#8747; nephew Filmer Honeywood, E&#8747;q; now Member for the County of Kent.</note>
<p>Before we leave the river Lowther, it may not be improper to remark, that it give&#8747; name to a village, and probably to the great and illu&#8747;triou&#8747; family of Lowther, who have had their re&#8747;idence in that village &#8747;ince the reign of Henry the II. The family-man&#8747;ion, called Lowther Hall, i&#8747; well worth the notice of the curiou&#8747; traveller; but above all thing&#8747;, the admirable carpet-manufa&#392;tory (carried on here for the &#8747;ole u&#8747;e and plea&#8747;ure of the family,) will amply gratify the curio&#8747;ity of a &#8747;pe&#392;tator, a&#8747; perhap&#8747; the whole world can &#8747;carcely equal it.</p>
<p>Among the many di&#8747;tingui&#8747;hed per&#8747;onage&#8747; which the Lowther family ha&#8747; produced, I &#8747;hall &#8747;elect a few of the mo&#8747;t remarkable.</p>
<p><i>&#8747;ir Hugh de Lowther</i>, Attorney-General to Edward the I.</p>
<p><i>&#8747;ir Hugh de Lowther</i>, who, together with Richard Denton, wa&#8747; commi&#8747;&#8747;ioned in the 17th of Edward the II. to &#8747;ummon&#8747; and have ready all the armed men of the county of Cumberland. Afterward&#8747;, in the 13th of Edward the III. the &#8747;ame &#8747;ir Hugh de Lowther wa&#8747; commi&#8747;&#8747;ioned to array all men at arm&#8747; in the countie&#8747; of Cumberland and We&#8747;tmorland.</p>
<p><i>William Lowther</i>, who, with &#8747;ir Thoma&#8747; Colville, &#8747;ir John Etton, knight&#8747;; William &#8747;elveyn, Henry Van Croypole, and &#8747;imon Ward, obtained leave from Richard the II. to challenge certain per&#8747;on&#8747; of the kingdom of &#8747;cotland to exerci&#8747;e feat&#8747; of arm&#8747;; and upon thi&#8747; the King appointed John Lord Roo&#8747; to fix a camp and be judge in the &#8747;aid exerci&#8747;e.</p>
<p><i>&#8747;ir Richard Lowther</i>, (the twelfth of the line,) wa&#8747; Lord-Warden of the We&#8747;t Marche&#8747;, and &#8747;everal time&#8747; a commi&#8747;&#8747;ioner in the conte&#8747;t&#8747; between the two kingdom&#8747; during the reign of Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>In the 11th year of heir reign he wa&#8747; &#8747;ent by her to Workington Hall, the &#8747;eat of the Cunven family, to take pri&#8747;oner Mary Queen of &#8747;cot&#8747;, who had fled thither, and to carry her to Carli&#8747;le, and there to keep &#8747;tri&#392;t watch over her: Hi&#8747; humanity, however, got the better of hi&#8747; duty, and he incurred Elizabeth’&#8747; di&#8747;plea&#8747;ure, by &#8747;uffering the Duke of Norfolk to vi&#8747;it the unfortunate Prince&#8747;&#8747; in her confinement.</p>
<pb n="8"/>
<p><i>&#8747;ir John Lowther</i> Baronet, (the &#8747;eventeenth of the line,) wa&#8747; (A.D. 1696,) advanced to the dignity of Vi&#8747;count and Baron, by the title of Baron Lowther of Lowther, and Vi&#8747;count Lon&#8747;dale. In 1699 he wa&#8747; made Lord Privy &#8747;eal, and wa&#8747; one of the Lord&#8747; Ju&#8747;tice&#8747; for the government of the kingdom during the King’&#8747; ab&#8747;ence. He died in 1700, at the early age of 45.</p>
<p><i>&#8747;ir Jame&#8747; Lowther</i>, (the twentieth of the line,) married Lady Mary &#8747;tewart, daughter of John Earl of Bute, but had no i&#8747;&#8747;ue. In the 23d year of George the III. he wa&#8747; created Earl of Lon&#8747;dale, by the &#8747;tile and title of the Right Honourable Jame&#8747; Earl of Lon&#8747;dale, Vi&#8747;count Lon&#8747;dale in the County of We&#8747;tmorland, and County-Palatine of Lanca&#8747;ter, Vi&#8747;count Lowther of Lowther in the &#8747;aid County of We&#8747;tmorland, Baron Kendal of Kendal in the &#8747;aid County, and Baron Burgh of Burgh in the County of Cumberland.</p>
<p>About three hundred yard&#8747; from Lowther Bridge, by the road-&#8747;ide, i&#8747; a monument of antiquity, called by &#8747;ome <i>Arthur’&#8747; Round Table</i>, by other&#8747; &#8747;imply the <i>Round Table</i>. Author&#8747; differ widely a&#8747; to the origin and u&#8747;e of thi&#8747; place; but there cannot, I think, be a doubt, that it hath been a place for the exerci&#8747;e of arm&#8747;.. It i&#8747; round, about an hundred and twenty feet diameter, &#8747;urrounded by a broad ditch, (two opening&#8747; excepted, which are diametrically oppo&#8747;ite to each other,) and all round it a &#8747;loping bank of earth, &#8747;eemingly intended for the accommodation of &#8747;pe&#392;tator&#8747;.</p>
<p>If we allow thi&#8747; to have been a place for the exerci&#8747;e of chivalry, the name of Arthur’&#8747; Round Table may not improbably be e&#8747;teemed the genuine one. King Arthur i&#8747; &#8747;aid to have lived much at Carli&#8747;le, and mo&#8747;t of the old &#8747;ong&#8747; and poem&#8747; concerning him and hi&#8747; knight&#8747; have their &#8747;cene laid in thi&#8747; country, and with the&#8747;e the popular tradition&#8747; accurately agree, a&#8747; we &#8747;hall &#8747;ee hereafter: it i&#8747; farther remarkable, that the old &#8747;ong&#8747; were lo&#8747;t in Engli&#8747;h, but were afterward&#8747; tran&#8747;lated from the French, in which language they had been pre&#8747;erved almo&#8747;t entire.</p>
<p>The hi&#8747;tory of the Order of the Round Table i&#8747; briefly thi&#8747;: King Arthur ob&#8747;erving many quarrel&#8747; about precedency among hi&#8747; knight&#8747;, about the year 516 cau&#8747;ed a Round Table to be made, at which all the Order, the &#8747;overeign him&#8747;elf not excepted, took their &#8747;eat&#8747; promi&#8747;cuou&#8747;ly: To thi&#8747; Table none were admitted but tho&#8747;e who had given &#8747;ufficient proof of their valour and dexterity in the u&#8747;e of arm&#8747;. A&#8747; there are &#8747;ome who even deny the exi&#8747;tence of King Arthur, I &#8747;hall not in&#8747;i&#8747;t farther on thi&#8747; &#8747;ubje&#392;t, but refer them to other author&#8747;, who&#8747;e province it i&#8747; more particularly to inquire into the&#8747;e affair&#8747;: I &#8747;hall, however, add from Favine, (lib. 5. p. 97.) a li&#8747;t of the fir&#8747;t table of the&#8747;e knight&#8747;.</p>

to Parliament. It i&#8747; very like Cumberland in it&#8747; &#8747;oil and climate, and a &#8747;imilarity of manner&#8747; i&#8747; every where to be found in both. Dr Falconer, in a learned and elegant paper, publi&#8747;hed in the Memoir&#8747; of the Literary &#8747;ociety of Manche&#8747;ter, ha&#8747; proved almo&#8747;t to demon&#8747;tration, that the <i>&#8747;cenery</i> of a country ha&#8747; the greate&#8747;t &#8747;hare in forming the manner&#8747; of it&#8747; inhabitant&#8747;: but to thi&#8747; I mu&#8747;t add another &#8747;ource equally powerful, <i>the nece&#8747;&#8747;itie&#8747; of &#8747;ituation</i>.</p>
<p>The contemplation of barren heath&#8747;, bleak, rocky mountain&#8747;, and almo&#8747;t impa&#8747;&#8747;able &#8747;wamp&#8747; and mo&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;, will naturally fill the mind with gloomy and uncomfortable idea&#8747;; but when the inhabitant ha&#8747; hi&#8747; daily &#8747;u&#8747;tenance to colle&#392;t from the&#8747;e dreary wild&#8747;, he will alternately &#8747;tarve and gluttonize. If he i&#8747; one day pinched with hunger, he will, if the next afford&#8747; him a prey, fall to with the voracity of a wolf. Can we then wonder, that people &#8747;o &#8747;ituated &#8747;hould have frequent quarrel&#8747; with their neighbour&#8747;? Can we wonder that they &#8747;hould, by every &#8747;pecie&#8747; of cruelty, endeavour to terrify their neighbour&#8747; from attacking them, where we mu&#8747;t be &#8747;en&#8747;ible that they have only the dreadful alternative to ma&#8747;&#8747;acre their invader&#8747;, or peri&#8747;h by hunger? When nece&#8747;&#8747;ity ha&#8747; thu&#8747; begun the pra&#392;tice of cruelty, a &#8747;pirit of revenge keep&#8747; it alive, till cu&#8747;tom rivet&#8747; it too fa&#8747;t to be ea&#8747;ily removed.</p>
<p>In every country where thi&#8747; i&#8747; not the ca&#8747;e, a &#8747;pirit of humanity in general keep&#8747; time with martial ardour. The vanqui&#8747;hed yielding enemy i&#8747; con&#8747;idered a&#8747; not only entitled to mercy, but prote&#392;tion: the valour he ha&#8747; that day &#8747;hewn, though at the expen&#8747;e of the noble&#8747;t blood of the vi&#392;tor&#8747;, increa&#8747;e&#8747; the re&#8747;pe&#392;t &#8747;hewn him; and no one ever think&#8747; of revenging at that time the death of a father, a &#8747;on, or a brother. The I&#8747;raelite&#8747; were perhap&#8747; the only civilized nation that ever ma&#8747;&#8747;acred a vanqui&#8747;hed enemy in cood blood; nor were they contented with death alone, for they tortured them in the mo&#8747;t cruel manner; “ they hewed them to piece&#8747; with axe&#8747;, and tore “ them with harrow&#8747;." It i&#8747; true, they pretended a divine mandate for thi&#8747;; but what age ha&#8747; not produced &#8747;ome crafty, de&#8747;igning prie&#8747;t, of art and impudence &#8747;ufficient to glo&#8747;&#8747; over the blacke&#8747;t crime&#8747;! The &#8747;ituation of the countrie&#8747; I am here de&#8747;cribing i&#8747; &#8747;uch, that they are extremely beautiful in &#8747;ummer, and equally cold, bleak, and uncomfortable in Winter; and a&#8747; we know that agriculture ha&#8747; been very lately improved, or even introduced here, we may conclude that the <i>nece&#8747;&#8747;itie&#8747;</i> of them were much varied. In &#8747;ummer, the inhabitant&#8747; would live plea&#8747;antly and plentifully enough by hunting and fi&#8747;hing; but in Winter, (before the art of pre&#8747;erving meat by the mean&#8747; of &#8747;alt wa&#8747; di&#8747;covered,) their fare mu&#8747;t have been very precariou&#8747;. Thi&#8747; would naturally enough introduce the de&#8747;ire of tho&#8747;e convenience&#8747; their neighbour&#8747; might chance to enjoy; and among people where legi&#8747;lature i&#8747; very imperfe&#392;t, a&#8747; their&#8747; wa&#8747; till very lately, the next &#8747;tep i&#8747; plunder. The con&#8747;equence&#8747; of the&#8747;e primeval habit&#8747; are &#8747;carcely yet worn out. We find, very late in the annal&#8747; of hi&#8747;tory, the inhabitant&#8747; of the&#8747;e northern countie&#8747; marked a&#8747; de&#8747;pi&#8747;ing danger to a great degree: mo&#8747;t of their way&#8747; of &#8747;peaking of it are ludicrou&#8747;; and whoever ha&#8747; &#8747;een them engaged in their favourite amu&#8747;ement, the <i>Foot-ball</i>, will perceive that even their diver&#8747;ion&#8747; were hazardou&#8747;. With all thi&#8747; ferocity, there wa&#8747;, however, a &#8747;trong tin&#392;ture of genero&#8747;ity; hi&#8747;tory, tradition, and the old popular ballad&#8747; confirm it by numeour&#8747; in&#8747;tance&#8747;. Even among the inhabitant&#8747; of the <i>debateable</i> ground there wa&#8747; a kind of principle of honour mixed with their theft&#8747;; for, though outlaw&#8747; from both kingdom&#8747;, and puni&#8747;hed with death when taken, they &#8747;eldom or never did violence to the per&#8747;on of the traveller, and have even been known to do a&#392;tion&#8747; of the highe&#8747;t genero&#8747;ity to tho&#8747;e who&#8747;e mi&#8747;fortune&#8747; needed &#8747;uch a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;tance. Thi&#8747; i&#8747;, a&#8747; far a&#8747; I can determine, the real chara&#392;ter of the northern countie&#8747;: I &#8747;hall only add, that the &#8747;pirit of the&#8747;e people, though changed from it&#8747; original channel, i&#8747; not lo&#8747;t; for now it break&#8747; out in ob&#8747;tinate law&#8747;uit&#8747;, a&#8747; the learned coun&#8747;ellor&#8747; who attend thi&#8747; circuit can avouch.</p>
<p>Near to Emont Bridge i&#8747; Mayburgh, or Maybrough, a &#8747;ingular and a&#8747;toni&#8747;hing piece of antiquity, nothing &#8747;imilar to it appearing either in thi&#8747; or any other country that I can hear of.

In that part which front&#8747; the Ea&#8747;t i&#8747; an entrance about 20 yard&#8747; wide; and near the centre &#8747;tand&#8747; a &#8747;ingle &#8747;tone of prodigiou&#8747; magnitude, being upward&#8747; of 12 feet high. &#8747;ome year&#8747; ago, there were four other &#8747;tone&#8747;, though not &#8747;o large a&#8747; thi&#8747; which remain&#8747;; of the&#8747;e, two were placed like door-po&#8747;t&#8747; at the entrance, and two in the amphitheatre. The&#8747;e &#8747;maller &#8747;tone&#8747; were bla&#8747;ted and removed by order of a per&#8747;on who appear&#8747; to have been at that time the farmer of thi&#8747; place: one of the men employed in the work having hanged him&#8747;elf, and the other turning lunatic, ha&#8747; given a fair opening for vulgar &#8747;uper&#8747;tition, to impute tho&#8747;e mi&#8747;fortune&#8747; to their &#8747;acrilege in defacing what they &#8747;uppo&#8747;e wa&#8747; formerly a place of eminent &#8747;anctity.</p>
<p>The origin and de&#8747;ign of thi&#8747; &#8747;ingular &#8747;tru&#392;ture are &#8747;o uncertain, that nothing more than mere conje&#392;ture can po&#8747;&#8747;ibly be adduced concerning them; it i&#8747;, according to &#8747;ome, a temple of the Druid&#8747;, according to other&#8747; it i&#8747; a fortre&#8747;&#8747;: <i>It</i> may be “ the circle of “ the terrible Loda, with the ma&#8747;&#8747;y &#8747;tone of hi&#8747; power," (&#8747;o often named in tho&#8747;e &#8747;ublime, pathetic, and unequalled poem&#8747; a&#8747;cribed to O&#8747;lian;) it may, in &#8747;hort be whatever learning guided by fancy can di&#392;tate.</p>

The famou&#8747; Round Table i&#8747; univer&#8747;ally acknowledged to be the &#8747;cene where the “ <i>brave of other</i> “ <i>day&#8747;</i>" vindicated their knighthood by feat&#8747; of arm&#8747;.

<p>That it ha&#8747; been no place of wor&#8747;hip belonging to the Druid&#8747; I think very evident: we no where learn that they had either temple or altar.

<p>A farther and &#8747;tronger argument of Mayburgh having been built about the &#8747;ame time with the Round Table, i&#8747; drawn from a very well-known piece of hi&#8747;tory.

That the&#8747;e domain&#8747; were in thi&#8747; neighbourhood the name and privilege&#8747; of Temple-&#8747;owerby plainly evince, a&#8747; it enjoy&#8747; to thi&#8747; day the immunitie&#8747; of the&#8747;e knight&#8747;, <i>viz</i>. exemption from land-tax and all toll&#8747; in every market, and freedom from the juri&#8747;di&#392;tion of the Bi&#8747;hop; the Lord thereof a&#392;ting both a&#8747; Bi&#8747;hop and Chancellor in hi&#8747; own Lord&#8747;hip.</p>

<p>HAVING cro&#8747;&#8747;ed the Bridge, and a&#8747;cended a &#8747;teep bank, we meet with a &#8747;mall road which lead&#8747; to Carleton-Hall; which we mentioned before, but &#8747;hall here give a &#8747;uccin&#392;t account of it from the earlie&#8747;t tradition to thi&#8747; pre&#8747;ent time. It wa&#8747;, about the time of the Conque&#8747;t, the property of a family of the name of Carleton, in which it continued through many &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ion&#8747;, until the year 1707, when it wa&#8747; purcha&#8747;&#8747;ed by Mr John Patti&#8747;on <i>Attorney</i> at law in Penrith.

For greater convenience&#8747;, they likewi&#8747;e built another cro&#8747;&#8747; at the town’&#8747;-head, and ere&#392;ted &#8747;hamble&#8747;, &#38;c.; the place &#8747;till retain&#8747; the name of the Cro&#8747;&#8747;-Green: they built a third cro&#8747;&#8747; near the Carli&#8747;le road a little above the &#8747;econd, where black cattle, &#8747;heep, hog&#8747; and goat&#8747; were &#8747;old; and it retain&#8747; yet the name of the Nolt-Fair<ptr target="n12"/>, and continue&#8747; to be the market for cattle.</p>

<p>WE now enter the town of Penrith, remarkable for the neatne&#8747;&#8747; of it&#8747; appearance, if we except the &#8747;hamble&#8747; and town-hall; mo&#8747;t of the hou&#8747;e&#8747; being built of red free &#8747;tone, and covered with tho&#8747;e <i>blue</i> &#8747;late&#8747; who&#8747;e excellence i&#8747; now well known throughout mo&#8747;t town&#8747; in the kingdom, though they are generally called, (I know not why) <i>White-&#8747;late&#8747;</i>.</p>
<pb n="15"/>
<p>Though an inland town, there are &#8747;ome very con&#8747;iderable manufa&#392;torie&#8747; of check&#8747;, which are daily increa&#8747;ing; two common brewerie&#8747; in good employ; two hair-merchant&#8747;, who, (limited a&#8747; their bu&#8747;ine&#8747;&#8747; may &#8747;eem,) are both men of property; and a tannery, where &#8747;ome bu&#8747;ine&#8747;&#8747; i&#8747; done. Yet a&#8747; the&#8747;e employ but a &#8747;mall part of the inhabitant&#8747;, perhap&#8747; the manner&#8747; of no place are more &#8747;trongly or generally &#8747;tamped with the mark&#8747; of ea&#8747;e and peace. Few are rich, but a&#8747; few mi&#8747;erably poor. Whoever wi&#8747;he&#8747; to enjoy a &#8747;ocial gla&#8747;&#8747;, i&#8747; &#8747;eldom at a lo&#8747;&#8747; for a companion. A regular Card-A&#8747;&#8747;embly, during the Winter; and &#8747;mall, though agreeable private partie&#8747; all the year round, furni&#8747;h the fair &#8747;ex with ample amu&#8747;ement; whil&#8747;t two well frequented bowling-green&#8747; afford, during the fine weather, exerci&#8747;e and amu&#8747;ement to &#8747;uch of the male&#8747; a&#8747; have no better employment. During the race&#8747; and a&#8747;&#8747;ize&#8747;, a more gay and agreeable place cannot be imagined. The more than u&#8747;ual bu&#8747;tle of tho&#8747;e time&#8747; rou&#8747;ing the inhabitant&#8747; out of that placid dream of exi&#8747;tence they at other time&#8747; enjoy, and animating them to a degree of real mirth and fe&#8747;tivity rarely met with in more pompou&#8747; &#8747;cene&#8747;.</p>
<p>But why not here, a&#8747; well a&#8747; any where el&#8747;e, &#8747;hould I pay the tribute due to the general manner&#8747; of the country? They de&#8747;erve it. Every reputable farmer in the neighbourhood pride&#8747; him&#8747;elf upon the goodne&#8747;&#8747; of hi&#8747; ale, and i&#8747; never &#8747;o happy a&#8747; when hi&#8747; friend&#8747; have taken a&#8747; much of it a&#8747; they can carry home. The gentlemen are remarked for affability and ho&#8747;pitality. True it i&#8747;, that, like tree&#8747; which grow &#8747;ingle, every little irregularity ha&#8747; ample room to expand and &#8747;hew it&#8747;elf; but at the &#8747;ame time, all i&#8747; pure nature, undi&#8747;gui&#8747;ed by art. To ri&#8747;e &#8747;till higher; even a Cynic would acknowledge, were he at Gray&#8747;tock, that there i&#8747; at lea&#8747;t one Nobleman who ha&#8747; the art of joining the poli&#8747;h of France to the ho&#8747;pitality of Britain, and who&#8747;e chief delight i&#8747; to &#8747;hew, that true nobility can re&#8747;ide alone in &#8747;uperior worth.</p>
<p>Penrith ha&#8747; an excellent market on Tue&#8747;day, and a &#8747;mall one on &#8747;aturday. The Tue&#8747;day market i&#8747; likewi&#8747;e a market for live-cattle, both fat and lean, from Lamma&#8747; till Whit&#8747;untide; but from Whit&#8747;untide till Lamma&#8747; the cattle-market i&#8747; held upon the Nolt-Fair. The market&#8747; here are di&#8747;po&#8747;ed in a manner truly a&#8747;toni&#8747;hing in &#8747;o &#8747;mall a town: the wheat-market i&#8747; in one part of the town; rye and potatoe&#8747; in another; barley in another; oat&#8747; and pea&#8747;e in another; live-cattle, hor&#8747;e&#8747;, and hog&#8747; have al&#8747;o their di&#8747;tin&#392;t market&#8747;. The mea&#8747;ure&#8747; here are different in different article&#8747;; a&#8747; there are two cu&#8747;tomary bu&#8747;hel&#8747; in u&#8747;e here, one of 80 quart&#8747; and another of 64: by the fir&#8747;t are &#8747;old barley and oat&#8747;; by the &#8747;econd, wheat, rye, fruit, pea&#8747;e and potatoe&#8747;. The &#8747;econd i&#8747; called the Penrith Bu&#8747;hel, and i&#8747; double the Winche&#8747;ter mea&#8747;ure, and three of the bu&#8747;hel&#8747; are called a Load.</p>

<p>The Antiquarian&#8747; &#8747;ay that thi&#8747; town take&#8747; it&#8747; name from the red-hill out of which it hath been built, and on which the Beacon now &#8747;tand&#8747;; thi&#8747; they found on the etymology of the name, Pen-rith, &#8747;ignifying Red-hill, or Red-head. Upon the whole, thi&#8747; &#8747;eem&#8747; a more probable conje&#392;ture, than that thi&#8747; Penrith wa&#8747; built out of the ruin&#8747; of the Ala Petriana which Hor&#8747;ley and other&#8747; call Old Penrith; for Ala Petriana, or Camlic Fort, i&#8747; at the di&#8747;tance of five mile&#8747;; and I cannot &#8747;uppo&#8747;e any one would fetch &#8747;tone&#8747; five mile&#8747;, when he had a&#8747; good within half a mile.</p>

<p>An equally probable account of thi&#8747; place i&#8747; taken from an old tradition and &#8747;ong, which inform&#8747; u&#8747; that one Torquin, a man of gigantic &#8747;tature, but addi&#392;ted to all kind&#8747; of rapine and brutality, lived in a cave in thi&#8747; neighbourhood, on the bank&#8747; of the river Emont. Thi&#8747; den, which yet retain&#8747; the name of the Giant’&#8747; Cave, i&#8747; about two mile&#8747; from Penrith, and i&#8747;, on &#8747;ome account, (the foundation of which i&#8747; now forgotten,) much re&#8747;orted to on the third &#8747;unday in May by the country people, who carry with them tea, liquor&#8747;, <i>&#38;c</i>. and there make merry. It con&#8747;i&#8747;t&#8747; of &#8747;everal cavern&#8747; in the rock&#8747;, the road to which lead&#8747; down a frightful precipice, quite to the water’&#8747; edge: thi&#8747; make&#8747; many decline the journey, but when down, the road i&#8747; more tolerable. Many &#8747;trange and incredible &#8747;torie&#8747; are told of thi&#8747; cave; one, which &#8747;eem&#8747; not &#8747;o ab&#8747;urd a&#8747; the re&#8747;t, and to have had &#8747;ome real foundation, i&#8747; a&#8747; follow&#8747;:</p>
<p>Torquin, or Torquina&#8747;, (a&#8747; &#8747;ome call him,) having &#8747;tolen &#8747;everal virgin&#8747;, conveyed them to thi&#8747; di&#8747;mal man&#8747;ion, where he kept them clo&#8747;e pri&#8747;oner&#8747;. One of them, however, found mean&#8747; to e&#8747;cape along the &#8747;ide of the rock: in her road &#8747;he wa&#8747; obliged to &#8747;tep over an hideou&#8747; gap a yard and an half wide; a rugged, craggy rock overhanging her head, &#8747;o a&#8747; &#8747;carcely to allow room to &#8747;tand upright, and a perpendicular de&#8747;cent of 48 feet underneath: the &#8747;ide&#8747; of the rock are &#8747;uch a&#8747; could afford no hold to her hand, and the boiling and rapidity of the impetuou&#8747; torrent which roar&#8747; beneath, are enough to confu&#8747;e the calme&#8747;t and mo&#8747;t intrepid. Notwith&#8747;tanding the&#8747;e horror&#8747; and difficultie&#8747;, &#8747;he pre&#8747;erved and effe&#392;ted her e&#8747;cape, and to thi&#8747; day the place ha&#8747; retained the name of the Maiden’&#8747; &#8747;tep.</p>
<p>Tradition further &#8747;ay&#8747;, that the ravage&#8747; of thi&#8747; Torquin coming to the ear&#8747; of King Arthur, he &#8747;ent &#8747;ir Lancelot du Lake to bring him to Court: Torquin refu&#8747;ing, a battle en&#8747;ued, in which Torquin fell, and wa&#8747; buried in Penrith church-yard, and the&#8747;e pillar&#8747; ere&#392;ted at hi&#8747; head and feet.</p>
<p>The engagement between &#8747;ir Lancelot and Torquin i&#8747; celebrated in many of the ballad&#8747; of the ancient ru&#8747;tic poet&#8747;: One of them I &#8747;hall in&#8747;ert, which ha&#8747; certainly been in great e&#8747;teem formerly, a&#8747; &#8747;hake&#8747;pear put&#8747; the fir&#8747;t line of it into the mouth of the facetiou&#8747; fat &#8747;ir John<ptr target="n14"/>; and it &#8747;hould likewi&#8747;e &#8747;eem even then to be an old &#8747;ong, a&#8747; &#8747;ir John i&#8747; repre&#8747;ented &#8747;inging it in the height of hi&#8747; mirth, in a &#8747;tyle that may appear to be one of the &#8747;ong&#8747; of hi&#8747; youth.</p>

</poem>
<p>I &#8747;hall leave thi&#8747; ancient ballad without any comment, only ob&#8747;erving, that the poet&#8747; were the be&#8747;t, if not the only hi&#8747;toriand&#8747; of ob&#8747;cure and remote time&#8747;; their &#8747;ong&#8747; were commonly true, el&#8747;e they could not hope for the attention of tho&#8747;e illiterate day&#8747;; and the theme wa&#8747; u&#8747;ually &#8747;ome remarkable tran&#8747;a&#392;tion, well known in the vicinity of the bard. Accordingly we find, that by the &#8747;ong&#8747; of <i>Thalie&#8747;&#8747;in</i>, the bone&#8747; of King Arthur<ptr target="n15"/> were di&#8747;covered at the di&#8747;tance of 646 year&#8747; from the death of that con&#8747;picuou&#8747; monarch; and I am convinced that a due attention to the&#8747;e old poem&#8747; may bring to light innumerable antiquitie&#8747;, and elucidate event&#8747; now buried in ob&#8747;curity.</p>
<note id="n15"><p>According to the be&#8747;t hi&#8747;torian&#8747;, Arthur died on the 21&#8747;t of May A.D. 542. In the year 1188 or 1189, King Henry II. finding an account of Arthur’&#8747; burying-place in the &#8747;ong&#8747; of the old Wel&#8747;h Bard Thalie&#8747;&#8747;in, and having great faith in the fa&#392;t&#8747; related by the&#8747;e old poet&#8747;, cau&#8747;ed the ground to be opened, that he might &#8747;ee the remain&#8747; of that celebrated warrior.</p>
<p>Externally there appeared two column&#8747; &#8747;imilar to the&#8747;e &#8747;tanding at Penrith at each end of the grave. After digging, &#8747;ome &#8747;ay &#8747;even, other&#8747; &#8747;ixteen feet, they came to a prodigiou&#8747; large flat &#8747;tone, when turning it, they found on the under &#8747;ide a leaden cro&#8747;&#8747;, with thi&#8747; in&#8747;cription,</p>
<p>HIC JACET INCLITU&#8747; REX ARTURIU&#8747;, IN IN&#8747;ULA AVALONIA.</p>
<p><i>Here lye&#8747; the Famou&#8747; King Arthur, in the I&#8747;land of Avalonia.</i></p>
<p>Thi&#8747; in&#8747;cription wa&#8747; engraven on that &#8747;ide of the cro&#8747;&#8747; which wa&#8747; next the &#8747;tone, &#8747;o that till the cro&#8747;&#8747; wa&#8747; &#8747;eparated from the &#8747;tone it could not be &#8747;een. Underneath they found, in the trunk of a large oak hollowed for the purpo&#8747;e, bone&#8747; of that prodigiou&#8747; &#8747;ize, that Cambren&#8747;i&#8747; (who lived at that time) relate&#8747;, from the authority of the Abbot of Gla&#8747;tonbury, that the &#8747;hin-bone being placed by the leg of a very tall man, reached three finger&#8747; breadth above hi&#8747; knee. Hi&#8747; &#8747;cull wa&#8747; likewi&#8747;e found, of va&#8747;t, but proportionable &#8747;ize, and upon it appeared ten wound&#8747;.</p>
<p>&#8747;ee &#8747;tow’&#8747; Chronicle, p. 55. -- GUTHRIF, p. 102</p></note>
<p>On the &#8747;outh &#8747;ide of the town &#8747;tand&#8747; the ca&#8747;tle, on a ri&#8747;ing ground, and &#8747;eem&#8747; once to have been a place of &#8747;trength, a&#8747; it i&#8747; &#8747;urrounded with a moat and other defence&#8747;. The fir&#8747;t founder i&#8747; unknown; but before the year 1237 it mu&#8747;t have been a very incon&#8747;iderable fortre&#8747;&#8747;; for at that time we find, that 200 librate&#8747; of land were granted to William King of &#8747;cot&#8747;. The&#8747;e were to be &#8747;et out, according to agreement&#8747;, in the countie&#8747; of Cumberland and Northumberland, where no ca&#8747;tle&#8747; were; and in ca&#8747;e of deficiency of land &#8747;o &#8747;ituated, it wa&#8747; to be &#8747;et out in the neighbouring countie&#8747;.</p>
<p>Now it appear&#8747; from the boundary-roll (taken at a perambulation 29. Edward II.) that the fore&#8747;t of Inglewood, together with the honour of Penrith, were the 200 librate&#8747; before named: it farther appear&#8747;, that in the year 1432, Richard duke of Glouce&#8747;ter, (afterward&#8747; Richard III.) re&#8747;ided here in quality of &#8747;heriff of Cumberland. He repaired the ca&#8747;tle, and lived here five year&#8747; together, in order to colle&#392;t tho&#8747;e northern clan&#8747; which were of the York party, and to keep in awe tho&#8747;e which were of the Lanca&#8747;ter party.</p>
<p>That part of the building which now remain&#8747; appear&#8747; to be of a much older date, a&#8747; the &#8747;tone&#8747; are &#8747;o firmly cemented a&#8747; to re&#8747;i&#8747;t the effort&#8747; of the workmen who attempted to pull it down; wherea&#8747; the Duke’&#8747; repair&#8747;, con&#8747;i&#8747;ting of a tower, porter’&#8747;-lodge, and &#8747;ome other detached building&#8747;, gave way very readily: be&#8747;ide&#8747;, the repair&#8747; were executed in white &#8747;tone&#8747;, wherea&#8747; the old building i&#8747; compo&#8747;ed of red one&#8747;.

The only remain&#8747; of the ca&#8747;tle are a large &#8747;quare building, and &#8747;everal arched cellar&#8747;, which were probably the <i>dungeon&#8747;</i> or <i>keep&#8747;</i>. One thing however i&#8747; remarkable; an arched, &#8747;ubterraneou&#8747; road lead&#8747; all the way from the ca&#8747;tle to the kitchen-floor of an hou&#8747;e in the town, called Dockwray-Hall, the di&#8747;tance being 307 yard&#8747;. &#8747;uch &#8747;ubterraneou&#8747; road&#8747; were not unfrequent in the&#8747;e old fortre&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;, and were doubtle&#8747;&#8747; intended for conveying provi&#8747;ion&#8747;, and preventing &#8747;urpri&#8747;e&#8747;.</p>
<p>Having fini&#8747;hed the de&#8747;cription of thi&#8747; town, it now remain&#8747; to give a &#8747;ketch of it&#8747; hi&#8747;tory, which i&#8747; unavoidably entangled with the general hi&#8747;tory of the country, and likewi&#8747;e with the hi&#8747;tory of England. Thi&#8747; town and &#8747;ignory underwent no change&#8747; different from tho&#8747;e of the whole county till the year 1251; at that time they were given a&#8747; the 200 librate&#8747; of land which King Henry the III. gave, together with 5000 merk&#8747; of &#8747;ilver, a&#8747; a portion with Margaret hi&#8747; daughter, who wa&#8747; then married to Alexander King of &#8747;cot&#8747;. It wa&#8747; given under the title of the Queen’&#8747; <i>Haim</i> (or <i>Home</i>) <i>Land&#8747;</i>. Though it thu&#8747; became a property to the &#8747;cotti&#8747;h Crown, it wa&#8747; only con&#8747;idered a&#8747; a part of the King’&#8747; private e&#8747;tate, (for which he did homage or fealty to the King of England, by paying one &#8747;oar hawk at the city of Carli&#8747;le,) and not a&#8747; being part of the &#8747;cot&#8747; dominion&#8747;. Thi&#8747; appear&#8747; from an a&#8747;&#8747;ize held 6. Edward I.; al&#8747;o from an inqui&#8747;ition taken at Carli&#8747;le in 21. Edward I. before Thoma&#8747; de Normanville, the King’&#8747; E&#8747;cheator, beyond Trent, A.D. 1292. The juror&#8747; there find, that the &#8747;aid manor&#8747; are worth 200 pound&#8747;, and that John Baliol i&#8747; next heir, and of the age of thirty year&#8747;.</p>
<p>Edward, however, in the 26th year of hi&#8747; reign, having quarrelled with Baliol, (then King of the &#8747;cot&#8747;,) &#8747;eized the&#8747;e land&#8747;, and gave them to Beck Bi&#8747;hop of Durham, (known by the name of the Fighting Bi&#8747;hop:) He enjoyed them not long, for being &#8747;ummoned to attend a parliament, held at Carli&#8747;le in the thirty-third of the &#8747;ame reign, and not appearing, the land&#8747; were adjudged to the Crown. In the year 1306, and the thirty-fourth of hi&#8747; reign, Edward gave the&#8747;e land&#8747; to the Duke of Britanny: In hi&#8747; family they continued till 11. of Edward IV.; when Ralph de Nevil (then Duke,) being &#8747;lain in battle at Barnet, they again reverted to the Crown for want of heir&#8747;. They continued in the Crown till William III. gave them to William Bentick E&#8747;q; (afterward&#8747; Earl of Portland,) hi&#8747; favourite page: In that family they continued till 1784, when hi&#8747; Grace the pre&#8747;ent Duke of Portland &#8747;old them to hi&#8747; brother-in-law the Duke of Devon&#8747;hire.</p>
<p>Thi&#8747; town of Penrith hath &#8747;everal time&#8747; &#8747;everly &#8747;uffered by the inroad&#8747; of the &#8747;cot&#8747;, particularly in the 19. of Edward III. when 26,000 entered Cumberland, laying wa&#8747;te all before them. They burnt Penrith, with &#8747;everal other village&#8747;; carried away all the inhabitant&#8747; whom they could any way make u&#8747;eful into &#8747;cotland, and there publicky &#8747;old them to the highe&#8747;t bidder: they likewi&#8747;e carried off 40,000 head of cattle, and committed &#8747;uch barbaritie&#8747; on the defencele&#8747;&#8747; and weak a&#8747; humanity mu&#8747;t &#8747;hudder at. In the 6. of Edward the II. they likewi&#8747;e made an incur&#8747;ion, and de&#8747;troyed thi&#8747; town, at which time it i&#8747; &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed many of the inhabitant&#8747; hid their money in the wall&#8747; of their hou&#8747;e&#8747;; being afterward&#8747; either killed or carried away captive&#8747;, the money wa&#8747; frequently left there; in&#8747;omuch that an old hou&#8747;e i&#8747; &#8747;eldom pulled down but &#8747;ome &#8747;ilver and other coin&#8747; are found. The&#8747;e calamitie&#8747;, joined to a want of water, and great di&#8747;tance from coal, (the neare&#8747;t being 26 mile&#8747; land-carriage,) made thi&#8747; town very thin of inhabitant&#8747;: but in the year 1748, Bi&#8747;hop &#8747;trickland of Carli&#8747;le remedied the former of the&#8747;e want&#8747;, by purcha&#8747;ing of the owner&#8747; of certain Mill&#8747;, (particularly Vaux of Catterlin,) &#8747;o much of the water of the river Petterell a&#8747; would flow through the eye of a mill-&#8747;tone. Thi&#8747; he generou&#8747;ly, at hi&#8747; own expence, conveyed to Penrith, and the water &#8747;till continue&#8747; to flow in the &#8747;ame quantity, and no more. &#8747;ince the general u&#8747;e of pump&#8747;, no town perhap&#8747; i&#8747; better &#8747;upplied

<p>After the Bi&#8747;hop’&#8747; patriotic exertion, the town continued to increa&#8747;e till the year 1598, when the plague almo&#8747;t depopulated it; &#8747;ince that time, it ha&#8747; flouri&#8747;hed gradually, and &#8747;eem&#8747; likely to increa&#8747;e. What probably ha&#8747; added to it&#8747; pro&#8747;perity i&#8747;, that, be&#8747;ide&#8747; the Queen’&#8747; &#8747;chool, there are &#8747;everal charity-&#8747;chool&#8747;, where indigent children are taught reading, writing, needlework, and every other branch that can make them u&#8747;eful member&#8747; of &#8747;ociety.</p>
<p>Among the illu&#8747;triou&#8747; familie&#8747; which thi&#8747; town hath produced I &#8747;hall only &#8747;ele&#392;t one, a&#8747; the re&#8747;t will be mentioned in other place&#8747;; I mean the Hutton&#8747; of Hutton-Hall. An honourable record of thi&#8747; family appear&#8747; upon a bra&#8747;&#8747; plate which wa&#8747; in the old church.</p>
<p>“ Here lyeth Mary, daughter of Thoma&#8747; Wil&#8747;on &#8747;ecretary of &#8747;tate to Queen Elizabeth, “ who wa&#8747; fir&#8747;t married to Robert Burdett<ptr target="n16"/> of Bramcourt, in the county of Warwick, “E&#8747;q; by whom &#8747;he had &#8747;ir Thoma&#8747; Burdett, Bart. and &#8747;everal &#8747;on&#8747; and daughter&#8747;; “ and wa&#8747; afterward&#8747; married to &#8747;ir Chri&#8747;topher Lowther, of Lowther in the country “ of We&#8747;tmorland, Knight. Her daughter Elizabeth Burdett wa&#8747; married to Anthony “ Hutton of Penrith, in the county of Cumberland, E&#8747;q; with whom &#8747;he lived “ and died the la&#8747;t day of May, Anno Domini 1622." Thi&#8747; old lady did not live in the &#8747;ame hou&#8747;e with her daughter, but in an hou&#8747;e (at her de&#8747;ire) called Bramcourt, or, a&#8747; commonly pronounced, Bramercourt.</p>
<note id="n16">De&#8747;cendent of that Thoma&#8747; Burdett, of whom &#8747;peed tell&#8747; u&#8747; a very remarkable &#8747;tory, Book II. p. 688. King Edward IV. being on a progre&#8747;&#8747; in Warwick&#8747;hire, and taking hi&#8747; diver&#8747;ion of hunting in Arrow park, (belonging to Burdett,) among other game killed a white deer, which Mr Burdett highly valued. Thi&#8747; being told to Burdett, that hi&#8747; buck wa&#8747; killed, but no mention made of the King’&#8747; name, he wi&#8747;hed that the buck’&#8747; horn&#8747; were in that man’&#8747; belly that killed him, or in hi&#8747; that fir&#8747;t propo&#8747;ed it. &#8747;ome court &#8747;ycophant&#8747; being at hand, reported hi&#8747; word&#8747;, and accordingly he wa&#8747; tried and condemned to death; in con&#8747;equence whereof he lo&#8747;t hi&#8747; head at Tyburn, and wa&#8747; buried in Grey-Friar&#8747; Church at London.</note>
<p>On the North &#8747;ide of the chancel wa&#8747; the following in&#8747;cription on a neat monument.</p>
<p>“Here lie&#8747; interred Anthony Hutton, E&#8747;quire, who wa&#8747; a grave, faithful, and judiciou&#8747; “ Councellor at Law, and one of the ma&#8747;ter&#8747; of the High Court of Chancery; &#8747;on “ and heir to that renowned knight &#8747;ir William Hutton of Penrith, and wa&#8747; matched “ into the noble family of &#8747;ir Thoma&#8747; Burdett of Bramcourt, in the county of Warwick, “ Baronet, by the marriage of hi&#8747; virtuou&#8747; &#8747;i&#8747;ter Elizabeth Burdett; who&#8747;e piou&#8747; “ care and religiou&#8747; bounty hath ere&#392;ted thi&#8747; marble tomb, to perpetuate the memory “ of &#8747;o worthy a commonwealth-man, and &#8747;o dear an hu&#8747;band, who died the 10th of “ July 1637.</p>
<p>Before I leave Penrith, I mu&#8747;t mention two piece&#8747; of church-hi&#8747;tory which occurred too late to be in&#8747;erted in their proper place. The fir&#8747;t i&#8747;, that there wa&#8747; from the time of Edward II. till the 20. of Richard II. an hou&#8747;e of Grey-Friar&#8747; here, but &#8747;o poor and &#8747;mall in number, that the name alone remain&#8747;. The other i&#8747; thi&#8747;; In the year 1355, &#8747;ome per&#8747;on&#8747; having committed &#8747;everal outrage&#8747; in the church and church-yard of Penrith, Bi&#8747;hop Walton i&#8747;&#8747;ued out a mandate to &#8747;ir Thoma&#8747; re&#392;tor of Burgham, and John de Docwray, threatning the greater excommunication to all concerned therein. Upon thi&#8747;, &#8747;everal of the pari&#8747;hioner&#8747; went to Ro&#8747;e Ca&#8747;tle and owned them&#8747;elve&#8747; guilty to the Bi&#8747;hop, humbly begging pardon, and intreating him to withdraw hi&#8747; mandate. Thi&#8747; he con&#8747;ented to, upon condition that each of them &#8747;hould make an offering before

Richard&#8747;on, E&#8747;q;) we arrive at a field called Bi&#8747;hop’&#8747; Flatt&#8747;, from whence i&#8747; the be&#8747;t view of the town: the church and &#8747;ome of the principal hou&#8747;e&#8747; are in front, and the venerable ruin&#8747; of the ca&#8747;tle in the back view, whil&#8747;t the blue di&#8747;tant mountain&#8747; clo&#8747;e the land&#8747;cape.

If the day be clear, you &#8747;ee Cumberland &#8747;pread like an immen&#8747;e map under you. Nor i&#8747; your view limited to that alone, Criffell, Cheviott, and Queen&#8747;bery-Hill in &#8747;cotland, are vi&#8747;ible toward&#8747; the N.E. though 80 mile&#8747; di&#8747;tant.
