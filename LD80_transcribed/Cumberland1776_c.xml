<p>
WHILST you was engaged in contemplating tho&#8747;e wonderful productions of ancient art, which ITALY is enriched with, I was tracing the ruder beauties of Nature in a dome&#8747;tic tour thro' the mountainous parts of WESTMORELAND and CUMBERLAND: You carried out with you a di&#8747;interested pa&#8747;&#8747;ion for your art, with faculties which this country hath rarely given birth to; and you return from your travels with &#8747;ome &#8747;pecimens of &#8747;o au&#8747;picious a &#8747;ort, that, when encouragement &#8747;hall provoke your genius to its full di&#8747;play, we are per&#8747;uaded you will take rank with the fir&#8747;t 

<pb n="4"/>

ma&#8747;ters of the highe&#8747;t province and be&#8747;t age of painting: I &#8747;et out on my expedition with no other preten&#8747;ions than a devout re&#8747;pect for Nature in her &#8747;ublime&#8747;t &#8747;hapes, and &#8747;ome &#8747;mall leanings towards the Mu&#8747;e; not enough to make our intercour&#8747;e the talk of po&#8747;terity, but barely &#8747;ufficient to fill up the hour. The fruit of my tour hath been, what I fear is &#8747;carce worth laying at your feet, the following Irregular Ode, which was literally &#8747;truck out on the &#8747;pot, and is addre&#8747;t to the Sun; for as the &#8747;ea&#8747;on was far advanced towards winter, we had frequent temptations to invoke that luminary, who was never very gracious to our &#8747;uit, except whil&#8747;t we were viewing the lack of KESWICK and its accompaniments.

<p>
If I &#8747;hould be a&#8747;ked why I give that to the world and you, which I really think &#8747;carce worthy of the acceptance of you and the world, Ihave only to an&#8747;wer, that if the hone&#8747;t pride of the Friend did not draw it into public, the idle vanity of the Poet would be well content to &#8747;pare the Pre&#8747;s its pains: but the gratification of &#8747;aying how much I re&#8747;pect your genius and e&#8747;teem your virtues, finds it an ea&#8747;y ta&#8747;k to overcome the remon&#8747;trances of Judgement, or the terrors of critici&#8747;m.

Mr. GRAY, who&#8747;e faculty of de&#8747;cribing can give life to &#8747;cenes which I &#8747;hould have conceived nothing but pencil could convey, hath left behind him a Journal, for which we are indebted to his candid friend and editor. This Journal refers to all the &#8747;cenes hinted at in the following Ode; and being a book in every body's hands, makes it unnece&#8747;&#8747;ary for me to trouble the Reader with any attempts of my own by way of notes, which with the be&#8747;t of poems &#8747;eldom accord, and in my in&#8747;tance might have been a hazardous experiment.

How it came to pa&#8747;s, that this enchanting di&#8747;play of &#8747;ublime and beautiful objects could extort nothing more than a pro&#8747;aic de&#8747;cription from a poetical pen, I am at a lo&#8747;s to gue&#8747;s. I have been favoured with a Manu&#8747;cript of the late ingenious Dr. BROWN, which I have the privilege of in&#8747;erting in this publication, and &#8747;hould &#8747;o have done, but that I found it had already got forth into the world, and was in print: It is touched with great &#8747;pirit, and in a glowing &#8747;tile, which gradually kindles till it breaks forth into the following rhap&#8747;ody, which I believe hath hitherto e&#8747;caped publication:

act. I walk forth in this &#8747;tupendous &#8747;cene, as into the grande&#8747;t earthly temple of the Creator; and as I take my proge&#8747;s thro' its &#8747;everal parts, often break forth with the divine P&#8747;almi&#8747;t in that grateful exclamation -- "O LORD, how <!-- I have used an em-dash here for the longer dash in the text --> manifold are thy works; "in wi&#8747;dom ha&#8747;t thou made them all."

What I have here in&#8747;erted is taken from a letter to a friend, and is a valuable &#8747;pecimen of the author. As for the minute delineations, which &#8747;ome travellers affect to give of &#8747;cenes that come under their contemplation, they &#8747;eldom convey to my apprehen&#8747;ion any map of the place they de&#8747;cribe. To you perhaps, who&#8747;e pictures are language, language may be a picture; and as I know you can paint our very words, words may in return paint that to you, of which a le&#8747;s intuitive mind takes no conception; the bulk of mankind however collect little from the&#8747;e de&#8747;criptions but the amu&#8747;ement of reading them; and the mo&#8747;t they can effect is to refre&#8747;h the memories of them, who have been on the &#8747;pot, or to in&#8747;pire tho&#8747;e, who have not been, with a re&#8747;olution of going thither. <!-- this could be a comma --> And in truth a more plea&#8747;ing tour than the&#8747;e lakes hold out to men of lei&#8747;ure and curio&#8747;ity cannot be devi&#8747;ed.

But the views of our young travelling gentry, as you mu&#8747;t well know, are not thus directed: on the road they are couriers; in the cities they are revellers: Whil&#8747;t they are journeying there is no re&#8747;pite

They have been told of the <i>gu&#8747;to</i> of the <i>antique</i>, but where to find it, or how to di&#8747;tingui&#8747;h it, they know no more than their mothers: <i>Virt&#249;</i> however is to be purcha&#8747;ed, like other &#8747;uperfluities, and in the end their <i>Cicerone</i> lays them in for a bargain, perhaps a patch-work head of <i>Trajan</i> &#8747;et upon a modern pair of &#8747;houlders, and made up with <i>Caracalla</i>'s no&#8747;e and <i>Nero</i>'s ears,

Thus equipt with the&#8747;e imperial reliques, with an veritable daubing of <i>Raphaelle</i>, copied from the very print which is given to prove its originality, and a huge <i>cameo</i> on his little finger, home they come privileg'd <i>Virtuo&#8747;i</i>, qualified to condemn every thing that their own countrymen can produce; and thus having contributed all that in them lies to di&#8747;grace their native land, they conclude their career by affecting to de&#8747;pi&#8747;e it. It is in vain that a native arti&#8747;t exhibits to their view the models of a <i>Mars</i> and a <i>Venus</i>, &#8747;uch as I am bold to &#8747;ay would have done credit to <i>Athens</i> in its pure&#8747;t age; they may <ptr target="n1"/> moulder in his &#8747;hop for them, unle&#8747;s indeed they had lo&#8747;t a leg or an arm in the ruins of <i>Hadrian</i>'s villa, and then they would purcha&#8747;e them at twice the cost of the whole figures,</p>

<stanza>
<line>FRIEND of man's feeble race, victorious &#8747;age,</line>
<line>Great tamer of the fever's rage;</line>
<line>Thine, mighty Ma&#8747;ter, is the art</line>
<line>To heal the father's bur&#8747;ting heart;</line>
<line>'Tis thine Elijah-like to &#8747;ave</line>
<line>The widow's darling from the grave;</line>

<pb n="24"/>
<line>Thine in the very ga&#8747;p of death</line>
<line>To re&#8747;cue the convul&#8747;ive breath,</line>
<line>And to a hu&#8747;band's bo&#8747;om give</line>
<line>Her, without whom I cea&#8747;e to live.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Now from the chamber of the &#8747;ickly Ea&#8747;t,</line>
<line>Scenting the bloody human fea&#8747;t</line>
<line>Hither Death's haggard family repair,</line>
<line>Scattering contagion thro' the troubled air:</line>
<line>Where'er the dread forerunners come,</line>
<line>Prophetic of the &#8747;ick man's doom,</line>
<line>The raven and the &#8747;creetch-owl &#8747;ing</line>
<line>Their boding knell, and clap the carrion wing.</line>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<line>And &#8747;ee, fa&#8747;t bound upon her ebon bier,</line>
<line>Frantic <i>Fever</i> in the rear:</line>
<line>Round her a vi&#8747;ionary group</line>
<line>Phantoms, and dreams, and terrors troop:</line>

<pb n="25"/>

<line>Mark how &#8747;he rolls her &#8747;taring eyes;</line>
<line>Hark, hark, &#8747;he &#8747;creams, &#8747;he laughs, &#8747;he cries,</line>
<line>And now be &#8747;till -- &#8747;he faints, &#8747;he falls, &#8747;he dies!</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Ah no; behold, &#8747;he starts again:</line>
<line>Cold, cold, thro' every &#8747;hivering vein</line>
<line>Runs the &#8747;lowly-creeping pain:</line>
<line>'Tis pa&#8747;t tho&#8747;e fiery &#8747;pots be&#8747;peak</line>
<line>The glowing furnace in her cheek;</line>
<line>'Tis in her brain; it mounts, it burns,</line>
<line>She freezes and &#8747;he flames by turns.</line>
<line>Now on the very throne of life</line>
<line>Di&#8747;traction reigns and mortal &#8747;trife,</line>
<line>The rebel arteries beat to arms,</line>
<line>And &#8747;hake her &#8747;oul with dire alarms;</line>
<line>Dread horrors &#8747;eize the toiling heart,</line>
<line>And circulate de&#8747;pair thro' every part.</line>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<line>Daughter, hell-born of &#8747;in and death,</line>
<line>Pa&#8747;s on and &#8747;top thy &#8747;tygian breath,</line>

<pb n="26"/>

<line>Deadlier than is the fatal bla&#8747;t,</line>
<line>That &#8747;weeps Numidia's &#8747;ultry wa&#8747;te:</line>
<line>And lo, where wrapt in clouds and fire,</line>
<line>Follows thy gaunt and gha&#8747;tly fire:</line>
<line>On his pale &#8747;teed erect the monarch &#8747;tands,</line>
<line>His dirk and javelin glittering in his hands;</line>
<line>This from a di&#8747;tance deals the ignoble blow,</line>
<line>And di&#8747;patches the re&#8747;i&#8747;ting foe;</line>
<line>Whil&#8747;t all beneath him, as he flies,</line>
<line>Dire are the to&#8747;&#8747;ings, deep the cries,</line>
<line>The land&#8747;cape darkens, and the &#8747;ea&#8747;on dies.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Oh thou, to whom &#8747;uch healing power is giv'n,</line>
<line>The delegate, as we believe, of heaven;</line>
<line>Here take thy interpo&#8747;ing &#8747;tand;</line>
<line>Here wave thy medicated wand;</line>
<line>Or leave a charm to guard my door,</line>
<line>'Till the con&#8747;uming plague be o'er.</line>
<line>-- But hark! what groan is this I hear?</line>
<line>Sad tidings for a father's ear;</line>

<pb n="27"/>
<line>See, where all pale my lov'd ELIZA &#8747;tands,</line>
<line>Cla&#8747;pt in mute angui&#8747;h her &#8747;ubmitted hands,</line>
<line>Angui&#8747;h too genuine to &#8747;eek</line>
<line>Acquaintance with the blabbing cheek;</line>
<line>In her &#8747;oft eye one ray of hope appears,</line>
<line>A Chri&#8747;tian's hope tempering a mother's fears:</line>
<line>The&#8747;e downward on her dying Son are bent,</line>
<line>This upward with her pray'rs to Heav'n's high throne is &#8747;ent.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And now with calm deliberate tread</line>
<line>I reach the fever-tainted bed;</line>
<line>Ah, luckle&#8747;s innocent, is that the hue,</line>
<line>Which Nature's ro&#8747;eat pencil drew?</line>
<line>Ah, chang'd alas, is that the face,</line>
<line>Where beam'd of late &#8747;uch youthful grace?</line>
<line>Accur&#8747;ed fever, why annoy</line>
<line>My gentle unoffending Boy?</line>
<line>Rather why did&#8747;t thou not arre&#8747;t</line>
<line>The full-gorg'd glutton at his fea&#8747;t?</line>

<pb n="28"/>

<line>Or in a drunken revel &#8747;mite</line>
<line>The lewd profaner of the night?</line>
<line>No, the&#8747;e &#8747;hall live, and Nature's toils</line>
<line>Repair what foul intemperance &#8747;poils,</line>
<line>And health and hope &#8747;hall deign to dwell</line>
<line>With harden'd convicts in their cell;</line>
<line>While &#8747;leep, which from his guiltle&#8747;s pillow flies,</line>
<line>Shall clo&#8747;e (O &#8747;trange to tell!) the game&#8747;ters haggard eyes.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Is there no drug to cool that burning brea&#8747;t;</line>
<line>No chance for one &#8747;hort moment's re&#8747;t?</line>
<line>Is there no hope? -- 'Tis pa&#8747;t -- I &#8747;ee</line>
<line>Art can no more: the re&#8747;t is left for me.</line>
<line>Come then, this wonder-working charm receive;</line>
<line>The la&#8747;t command thy father hath to give:</line>
<line>The dying youth all o'er convuls'd they rai&#8747;e,</line>
<line>He to the la&#8747;t the well-known voice obeys;</line>
<line>The mother aids the draught, and, as &#8747;he aids it, prays.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Soft awhile! let all be &#8747;till,</line>
<line>And wait high Heav'n's di&#8747;po&#8747;ing will.</line>
<line>Now in each other's eyes we &#8747;tare</line>
<line>With looks, that a&#8747;k if Hope be there:</line>
<line>Mean while the magic drug, at &#8747;trife</line>
<line>With the dete&#8747;ted foe of life,</line>
<line>Runs to the heart, mounts to the brain,</line>
<line>And vi&#8747;its each corrupted vein;</line>
<line>Where'er it comes bids tumult cea&#8747;e,</line>
<line>And hail the me&#8747;&#8747;enger of peace.</line>

<stanza>
<line>Now, lengthening on the li&#8747;t'ning ear,</line>
<line>The &#8747;oft &#8747;ub&#8747;iding &#8747;igh we hear;</line>
<line>His breath, a wint'ry &#8747;torm before,</line>
<line>That loudly la&#8747;h'd the &#8747;ounding &#8747;hore,</line>
<line>Now &#8747;inks into a &#8747;ummer breeze,</line>
<line>That gently lifts the &#8747;welling &#8747;eas;</line>
<line>O'er his parch'd &#8747;kin a healthful dew appears,</line>
<line>The &#8747;tern di&#8747;temper &#8747;heds repentant tears;</line>
<line>He &#8747;miles, he turns, he &#8747;leeps -- Oh joy! -- Begone, my fears!</line> <!-- end of line unclear -->

<line>Ha&#8747;te then, my Mu&#8747;e, tear down the oaken bough,</line>

<line>From &#8747;age Apollo's delphic oak;</line>
<line>Then, dripping from Ca&#8747;talia's &#8747;pring,</line>
