<head level="2" align="center">WANDERINGS IN WORDSWORTHSHIRE.</head>
<p>THERE is a certain section of the English people which, when spring is advancing, begins to think of a "little outing." "In the spring," the poet tells us, "the young man's fancy, lightly turns to thoughts of love" (or "Nancy," as we have heard it quoted). In like manner many older people turn to thoughts of travel, and seek information according to the mood they are in &#8212; possibly imperative, generally indefinite. We have seen many lands in our chequered lifetime; but, given only a moderate sum and moderate time, we know of no district which, for a Londoner, can be so pleasantly visited as "Wordsworthshire," the English Lake District. There we find mountains, small it is true, but beautiful; lakes of contracted dimensions no doubt, but surrounded by exquisite views; we are not chilled in snow nor parboiled by the sun; we need no alpenstock, and scarce a guide by our trusty book. We can view nature in all her charming moods, petulant, gay, weeping, laughing, in a day. Nature up the Lakes is certainly apt to be weeping too often, but our experience has been that her charms lie in this diversity of her moods, as Samuel Lover sings,&#8212;</p>
<poem>
<line>"Half sunshine, half tears,</line>
<line>Like the girl I love best."</line>
</poem>
<p>We may be old-fashioned, but we must tell<pb n="420"/> those who go to the District that a "doing" of the Lakes by the quickest route is a grave mistake. To hurry up to Windermere, and by coach to Keswick, see Derwentwater and return, is <i>not seeing the Lakes.</i> They should be enjoyed &#8212; "taken in at the pores," as Joey Ladle says. No hurry-skurry will suit "Wordsworthshire." Such people as we refer to &#8211; and we have met many in our pedestrian excursions &#8211; will tell you that it <i>always</i> rains in Westmoreland. It is probably beautiful before they are out of bed, and lovely in the sunset glow while they doze after dinner.</p>
<p>To see the Lakes, go afoot. Take an umbrella and stout boots, a haversack and waterproof; send on your portmanteau by coach or rail, and walk like a Briton &#8212; with your wife, if you have one. I speak from happy experience. "What man has done man may do," and (in this age of "rights" more particularly) we may apply the saying to women. Then afoot we will go, and you may depend upon your present guide, who has "tramped o'er moss and fell" many a summer day in the Lake District.</p>
<p>There would be nothing easier than to extend this article to very large dimensions by long "Recollections" of "Christopher North," Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, and the poet Close, who, "if he's not gone, is living there still," like the eldery lade of our youthful days, "under the hill." We can quote Wordsworth and Harriet Martineau, we can fill half-a-column with the tumbledown falls of Lodore, after Southey, and chat with De Quincey and Wilson, the "North" aforesaid. But we wish rather to look again at the Lakes as we have seen them, and while indicating spots associated with the poets and celebrated ones of the past and tracing their footsteps in the "sands of time," we would rather take the present in the foreground, leaving the "Race of Giants," as Professor Wilson called the mountains, to fill in our picture.</p>
<p>The best time to go to the Lakes and the best way to go are questions which are always asked and never satisfactorily answered. Our advice is to go when you can, except in mid-winter (unless there is skating on Derwentwater), and in any direction you fancy. You can't go far wrong, and that's a comfort. If there be a choice we should say, enter the District <i>via</i> Lancaster, Grange, and Furness Abbey, and come out by Windermere. We do not lay this route down as a challenge, we merely give it expression. If the tourist leave Euston on Saturday night he will confess we are right, and for this reason: he will have a less crowded train, for no Scotch passengers are carried so late on Saturday, and he will be able to remain quietly at Furness on Sunday, to gather strength for the toil of the coming week.</p>
<p>A Sunday passed in quiet contemplation at Furness Abbey, if the day be fine &#8212; and we have always been fortunate in that respect &#8212; will prove a lasting remembrance. You will probably arrive at 5 a.m. and go to bed. But a few hours' sleep will refresh you, and the songs of the birds in the fine trees all round the hotel will awake you, and the glimpse of the most picturesque ruin in England, save, perhaps, "Fountains," will call you out of bed. After breakfast, service, and after church a long afternoon in the abbey.</p>
<p>It will be well spent in this "Valley of the Deadly Nightshade," ominous as the title is. Founded in 1127 by Stephen, "afterwards" King, as the play-bills write it, the Cistercian Monastery was a very powerful one. It is beautifully situated in the midst of fertile meadows and surrounded by woods; a trout-stream, now <i>sans</i> trout, runs gently by the ruins, babbling in its old age of the days gone by when it was a bigger stream and of great consequence. No people had such taste, no people had such an eye for effect and for the effect upon Number One, as the monks of old! The situations of the numerous ruins of their establishments testify to their love of the picturesque and of plentiful seclusion, as they took care</p>
<poem>
<line>"To live on the daintiest cheer"</line>
</poem>
<p>furnished by Furness, or by the wood and water surrounding the district.</p>
<p>The abbot was a great man in the days of old. He possessed almost regal authority within the lordship of Furness, which included a large tract of country from Windermere and Langdale to the sea. The abbots did as they pleased till the "Great Harry" put an extinguisher upon them, and so cooled the warmest adherents of Furness. The last abbot retired upon a pension, and no doubt died in the odour of sanctity. Could the worthy monks now revisit their favourite haunts they would find things slightly changed; the locomotive would, we think, call for a considerable expenditure of holy water.</p>
<p>Every guide-book describes the Abbey, and like most abbeys it will "grow upon" the attention. Picture the olden times, mark<pb n="421"/>the enormous extent of the building, the beautiful arches, the pillars, the gateways, and all the architectural beauties of cloister and chapel. Sit quietly down and think this Sunday morning of all that has passed within these massive walls, the incense rolling heavenward with the chants of monkish devotion, the penances, the scourgings, it may be the sins that were committed and repented of in this quiet and lonely spot, "far from the madding crowd." Think of all these things; the ruins have survived them all! The cold and senseless stone has long outlived the builder, made in the image of his Creator. Dust to dust! Yet the ruin lives, and speaks to all who care to question it of its glory long departed.</p>
<p>Such thoughts as these are not unfitted for our day of rest, and all will take leave of the Abbey with regret. Next morning we are up betimes to take another look, and then the train will carry us to Newby Bridge by Windermere Lake for Bowness, or (if we prefer it) Low Wood at the farther end which we reach by steamer. At present we are inclined to put up at the "Old England" Hotel at Bowness, and in the trim gardens we can have a game of lawn-tennis while luncheon is made ready. On this occasion we are four in party, and after luncheon we think we will hire a boat, hot though the day is, and pull gently across Windermere to the old ferry. It is a lovely day. Scarce a cat's paw ripples the glassy surface as we push gently forth, the light boat dividing the water with a pleasant soothing murmur of breaking bubbles, as we pass over the lake. We were delighted, and vowed that wet weather in the Lakes was at any rate only a probability. The idea of any one bringing an umbrella except to keep the sun off! What's that? Thunder? Well, it <i>was</i> like it. "But it cannot be," says one of the party; "there is no cloud." We went on. Soon some cloud-tendrils pushed themselves over the hills at the end of the lake, and gripped the rocks tightly, lifting great masses of cumuli after them. Here it comes. The gusts of wind now race headlong down the gullies, and skate over the lake, tearing up the foam and waves. "Pull under the lee of the island, quick." A flash &#8212; a rattling peal is echoed from the "Pikes," and back again. Ere it has ceased, another gleam, and a great dash of rain; then another and a lesser roar. The clouds limber up, and Heaven's artillery goes over beyond Windermere, and soon the sun has it all his own way again. Yes; there is wet weather up in Cumberland, no doubt.</p>
<p>Still, it was a glorious day, and we could sing with the poet of the Lakes &#8212;
</p>
<poem>
<line>"Our pastime was, on bright half-holidays,</line>
<line>To sweep along the plain of Windermere</line>
<line>With rival oars."</line>
</poem>
<p>These rival oars were with us no fiction either. It has been before stated that we were four in party, and it subsequently in the evening occurred to one of the men (there were three) to ask the single lady to "come for a row" in the twilight. There was no objection made, and this couple proceeded to drift about in real romantic style. The others, driven to despair and tobacco, also hired a skiff, and meanly haunted the track of the pair; yet stopped entranced, to listen to a song <i>she</i> sang amid the silence of the stars. The gentle breeze drifted the boats along. The hotel hung out its lights, and then all obeyed the signal to turn in.</p>
<p>Wanderers as we were, it did not matter whither we directed our steps. We were all good pedestrians, and walking in moderation was resolved upon. It was at length decided that Grasmere should be out next stopping place. I think the lake and the evening light were powerful attractions for two of our party &#8212; and brothers are indulgent to an only sister. At any rate we took steamer to Waterhead, and while the two most interested managed to "take care of the luggage," and proceed by coach to the "Prince of Wales" Hotel, the other two walked by the very pretty road to Red Bank, by Rydal Water.</p>
<p>This is a charming stroll, and well worth the time expended; the distance and fatigue are <i>nil.</i> Proceeding by the road to the elft, and crossing Rothay Bridge, the pedestrian will see a gate opposite, leading apparently into private grounds. But enter boldly, and a beautiful part-like road will be traversed. We may pause awhile on the bridge to note the Rothay and the Brathay, twin streams, in which the char and trout divide &#8212; one fish ascending one and the other the other river. We think perchance of Ambleside, which we hope to visit again, and of Harriet Martineau and her charming residence, "The Knoll." As we turn our faces Rydal-ward we pass a series of pretty houses embosomed in evergreens and with beautiful gardens. The peacefulness of these retreats is enviable, and we think we should like to live out our lives in such a spot as this. On our way to Grasmere we pass Fox House, at one time the residence of Doctor Arnold, on the right;<pb n="422"/> and Rydal Hall and Rydal Mount are prominent. These two last mentioned are celebrated; one as the seat of the Flemings, and the other as the residence of Wordsworth.</p>
<p>Rydal Mount is an unpretending edifice, wreathed with ivy and creepers &#8212;</p>
<poem>
<line>"... Mid cliff and stream and cultured rose,</line>
<line>In love with nature's self, and she with thee."</line>
</poem>
<p>as Mrs. Sigourney writes <i>apropos</i> of Wordsworth's residence.</p>
<p>But our present walk will not lead us to the poet's house. We continue our way as far as Pelter Bridge, and then turn up the rugged footpath to the left. Mounting for a little time, we suddenly come in full view of Rydal Water, its tiny island reflected in the glassy surface. To suddenly rise up and get such a beautiful view is well worth the little trouble, and this prospect from Loughrigg is far superior to the views of the Lake from the coach road opposite.</p>
<p>Proceeding straight forward, skirting the Lake, and then bearing slightly to the left, the pedestrian will soon reach Red Bank, and from the elevated path will look down upon Grasmere. Loughrigg Fell rises steeply, musical with rippling streams, high on the left. The ascent can be made without any difficulty, though there are many damp spots to be avoided. From Red Bank ordinary people will walk on, taking the road to the right through Grasmere all round the Lake; the knowing ones, who wish to avoid so long a walk by which nothing is gained, will have desired a boat from the Hotel opposite to come across and pick them up on the strand at the foot of Red Bank. When two of the party are given to boating in a "pair," this is not difficult. It saves time, and brings one "within a measurable distance of the civil war" of knives and forks, and the artillery of Bass and Co's bottles.</p>
<p>One is apt to whistle or hum a very popular air upon entering the hotel, for the arrangements of the "Prince of Wales" are very excellent. I have frequently put up there, and can speak from experience, but they do not know my name, and therefore this testimony need not be accepted as in any way interested. Grasmere &#8212; or rather this hotel &#8212; is a most charming head-quarters, and we had many wanderings in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Of course we had a boat after dinner that evening, and the stillness and charm of the night are quite beyond description. The shadows of the hills were as sharply defined in the clear water as in a picture. The light very reluctantly quitted the sky; the purple mountains, the pale blue firmament in which bright diamond points glittered one by one to see themselves reflected in the darkening water &#8212; all were lovely and soothing. The curling smoke from our cigars or pipes ascended, and once more the clear soprano voice arose, this time with the cheery notes of "Twickenham Ferry," as we gently sculled in unison.</p>
<p>At lenght the song died away; the boat's head was put about, and we left Grasmere Lake to the shadows and the stars...
</p>
<p>Grasmere, or Grismere, received its name from the grise, or wild swine, with which this district formerly abounded, and not from the grassy-mere, for originally the word was never written Grasmere. That the name was derived from the Swinish may be accepted as certain, as Boardale, Stybarrow, Grisedale, &amp;c., still witness, and, "please the pigs," will long continue so. Grasmere is full of interest, and we devoted some time to it. There are numerous charming excursions, but as we are not writing a guide-book, we will only say that we did, and leave others to follow us or not, as they may be advised. The little excursion to Easedale Tarn is a pleasant way of spending an afternoon. But our first visit in the neighbourhood was to the church, for there, or rather in the churchyard, was Wordsworth buried. He had occupied a house at Town-end for many years, which residence he afterwards vacated for De Quincey. The epitaph in the church is by the reverend author of the "Christian Year," and all details concerning the monuments and the hallowed resting-places of the poet and his family, and Hartley Coleridge, we must pass by with this mere reference.</p>
<p>Now off to Easedale Tarn; and here again we noticed a strong disposition on the part of two of our companions to "pair." They had already in the interval between coming downstairs and the somewhat tardy appearance of breakfast strolled off to the Wishing Gate, and no doubt read the lines <i>t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te&#8212;</i>
</p>
<poem>
<line>"Yes, even the stranger from afar,</line>
<line>Reclining on the moss-grown bar"&#8212;</line>
</poem>
<p>and remembered that</p>
<poem>
<line>"Hope rules a land for ever green.</line>
<line>All powers that serve that bright-eyed queen,</line>
<line>Are confident and gay.</line>
<line>Clouds at her bidding disappear.</line>
<line>Points she to aught? &#8212; the bliss draws near,</line>
<line>And fancy smooths the way."</line>
</poem>
<p>No doubt the whole poem from a guidebook of the period was read, but personally I doubt whether they wished half as sincerely<pb n="423"/> as the others who were waiting breakfast and wishing fervently for their return.</p>
<p>When they did stroll in unconsciously and wondering why we had waited, the truly innocent faces were a study &#8212; but any reference to the wishing-gate subsequently brought forth a conscious look that was amusing.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances the elders of the party who had compassion upon the young people, proposed a slight alteration in the arrangements. It was suggested that the walkers should go up to Easedale and beyond across the Langdale Pikes, and so round to Grasmere again by Dungeon Gill and the high road. The younger ones were thus permitted to return alone to the hotel, on condition that they met the others with the boat, as on the previous day.</p>
<p>So we started up to Easedale Tarn. The way is easy to find, and the distance is close upon three miles. Ponies can be taken, that is if they will go. We hired one, but he was so dreadfully "rough" that the fair rider was fain to dismount, and the animal was sent back in disgrace. I thought I perceived a lurking smile upon his countenance, and I am sure I detected a wink at the boy who was leading him, as the pair started for the hotel. We wondered whether this was an understood arrangement between the boy and the horse, after a certain distance had been traversed.</p>
<p>We followed the second turning to the left as directed, and arrived at a pretty little bridge, we crossed it, and then walked through fields, by the stream all the way. It is certainly a charming excursion and no one should miss it. On previous occasions we had come in the reverse direction over the Pikes from Langdale. This time our experience was different. A good-looking waterfall, termed Sour-milk Force, is seen as one ascends. The scenery all around is wild and very beautiful, and fortunately the day was delightful. Fine clouds at a good elevation swept across the sun occasionally, and gave us a pleasant respite from this heat.</p>
<p>We reached Easedale Tarn at length, and found the man in the hut with his visitor's book and his stumpy pen, and his light refreshments as of old. We found the record of our former excursion thither, when a certain person of the party accompanied by another of the opposite sex, hired the boat and rowed about the lake, after a long ramble across the Langdale Pikes. On this present occasion, the "pair" took possession of the boat, and as we walked on towards Stickle Tarn and the Pikes, we could see him sculling gently about, while she leant forward to catch the "sweet words." We waved them an adieu, and then we set our faces for the hills.</p>
<p>We kept directly up the face of the hill, and found the ground very wet in places, but without any great difficulty we got to the top and to Stickle Tarn, which lies under a beautiful precipice that is very imposing. We climbed to the top of the Pike, and crossing more wet ground got a lovely view over the mountains and into Langdale Valley. We climbed round the base of the rocky elevation, and struck a path, or what appeared to be a path &#8212; it was very indistinct, however. At any rate we descended in as direct a line as possible, and soon found a pony track which led us to the Dungeon Gill path in the ravine. It was fortunate that the day continued fine, for had a mist suddenly descended we might have had a "bad quarter of an hour" on the mountain. But as it was, we descended in safety, and reached the terrace above the Grasmere Lake, in good time to watch the youthful "pair" coming across the water to take us up as arranged. We had a capital view of Grasmere, and Wordsworth's lines certainly accurately sketch the place &#8212;</p>
<poem>
<line>"Upon a rising ground a grey church tower</line>
<line>Whose battlements were screen'd by tufted trees,</line>
<line>And towards a crystal mere that lay beyond,</line>
<line>Among steep hills and woods embosom'd, flowed</line>
<line>A copious stream with boldly, winding course&#8212;</line>
<line>. . . . .  A cheerful, quiet scene."</line>
</poem>
<p>We had a little direction that evening as to the direction in which we should next day proceed. If the weather continued fine, Grisedale Pass to Patterdale was voted as the correct excursion, and if anyone wished to ascend Helvellyn, why he could. The pony was ordered, not the rough gentleman of the previous day, and after an excellent breakfast &#8212; no wishing this time &#8212; we started for Ullswater and Patterdale. The distance is but nine miles, and the excursion there and back can easily be accomplished in a day, even including the ascent of Helvellyn, which one of us once united with the trip.</p>
<p>The direction cannot be mistaken. About a mile from the hotel a path leads to the right. There is, or was, a sign-post there, and then by a rugged path the Grisedale Tarn is reached. The path up to Helvellyn keeping on the left and rising rapidly after the stream is crossed. The path zig-zags up the Dolly Waggon Pike, but a direct ascent can be<pb n="424"/> made. It is rather steep work, though, and the heart must be pretty tough to asccend rapidly. The weather was again lovely, and the views that opened at every yard's ascent were more comprehensive. At length, after a steep climb, the level portion is reached, and a long, and it may be, solitary walk is to be taken. We remember on one previous occasion, when we had ascended alone, we found the wind blowing with tremendous force, so much so that it was dangerous to keep too near the precipices which lie to the right. There is no beaten path, but the prints of the horses' feet will serve as indications of the route. More than once on that memorable afternoon we had to throw ourselves down on the ground to avoid being blown over, and gladly we rested to enjoy the view, which embraces a very extensive prospect. Numerous lakes and tarns are visible, and nearly all the District Peaks can be counted, and named in order by any one who knows them or who has a good map. We were content to rest and gaze, seated some paces down the mountain side to windward.</p>
<p>It was certainly impressive. There was not a sound to be heard but the hissing of the tufts of grass, as the wind swept in fearful gusts up the mountain. The clouds came hurrying up and passed overhead, with hanging and ragged edges, as if electricity was at work up there, as doubtless it was. The sea was distinctly visible, and as we gazed over the almost boundless prospect, "behold there arose a little cloud over the sea." This is no figure of speech, but a literal fact. We watched that cloud very attentively, because we had had some experience of these apparently innocent patches of vapour. We saw that the cloud had extended itself, and in about ten minutes had worked out into a long, low wall of dark grey on the horizon, right in the wind's eye.</p>
<p>We had still a long distance to go, and the way was quite unknown to us. We recalled the accounts of various accidents, and as luck would have it, the poem of Sir Walter Scott, commencing &#8212;</p>
<poem>
<line>"I climbed the dark brow of the mighty Helvellyn,"</line>
</poem>
<p>came ringing through our memory, and as we rose and proceeded, our feet at a rapid pace kept time to the rhythm of the verse which <i>would</i> obtrude &#8212;</p>
<poem>
<line>"Dark green was that spot 'mid the brown mountain heather,</line>
<line>When the Pilgrim of Nature lay stretched in decay,</line>
<line>Like the corpse of an outcast abandoned to weather,</line>
<line>Till the mountain winds wasted the tenantless clay,</line>
<line>Not yet quite deserted tho' lonely extended,</line>
<line>For faithful in death his brute favourite attended,</line>
<line>The much-loved remains of his master defended,</line>
<line>And chased the hill-fox and the raven away."</line>
</poem>
<p>We wished we had never learnt that poem, for every time we turned to gaze upon the scene things were looking worse and worse. The little cloud had extended itself and hidden Windermere in fog, which now came sweeping up the slopes beneath us, and was already high in the air swooping overhead. There was no time to lose, and none was lost, until the striding edge was gained, and then the fog descended with us, keeping us company most closely nearly all the way to Patterdale, where, at the Ullswater Hotel, we found our friends quite unprepared for so quick a return to them.</p>
<p>This is the only thing ever approaching an adventure that we have ever experienced in the Lake District, and it is noticed here not because there is anything wonderful in it, but because it may serve as a warning to inexperienced people not to trust themselves upon a mountain alone. Fogs and thick mists descend very rapidly in Cumberland, and in all mountain districts, and care should be taken not to wander, like the "goosey-gander" of our childhood, foolishly.</p>
<p>But to resume. We succeeded in our expedition to Grisedale and back on the next trip, the lady attended by her faithful squire. We did not ascend the mountains, for clouds were gathering around us, but we reached Patterdale without adventure, and after an early dinner returned to Grasmere in the evening in time for another row and another song. It was on that occasion that we made up our minds to cross by Dunmail Raise to Keswick, and by doing so quit "Wordsworthshire" proper, which does not extend to Derwentwater, though we proceeded thither, and crossed many passes and hills ere we returned to Lancaster and London.</p>
<p>Dunmail Raise carries a history and a legend. The Raise is a bare track rising between Seat Sandal and Steel Fell. The pass is 700 feet above the sea, and a cairn indicates the place where Dunmail, king of Cumberland, was defeated by Edward, king of England, in the year of grace 945. Not content with beating the king of Cumbria, Edmund put out the eyes of his (the defeated monarch's) sons, and then gave the kingdom to Malcolm of Scotland "to hold in fee." The stream on the right hand divides the<pb n="425"/> counties of Cumberland and Westmoreland. The cairn has been celebrated by Wordsworth,</p>
<poem>
<line>"That pile of stones</line>
<line>Heaped over brave king Dunmail's bones,</line>
<line>He who had once supreme command,</line>
<line>Last king of rocky Cumberland."</line>
</poem>
<p>The legend tells us how a price had been set upon the head of Dunmail, and as he and his faithful Leolf were wandering about the hills, hoping that an opportunity would arise to call his followers to arms, Leolf left him to arouse his adherents and to rejoice them with the news that the king still lived, and Dunmail was left alone among the hills.</p>
<p>He was suddenly awakened or aroused by a gleam of light, and a beautiful Druidess appeared.</p>
<p>"Why are thou here, Dunmail?" she inquired, though, if she were as knowing as spectres usually are supposed to be, the question was somewhat superfluous. Indeed the king appears to have been somewhat of this opinion, as he replied &#8212;</p>
<p>"Need I answer? Thou who hast recognised me at first sight cannot require to be told that I have been driven from my throne to become a joint tenant of the wilderness with the eagle and the wolf."</p>
<p>After this gentle hint the Druidess seems to have descended to prophecy, but wished to make the king's deliverance from his enemies the subject of an exchange. Alas that female Druids, and their apparitions even, are not above barter! The prudent king replied that so long as his people's rights or his own honour was not compromised he was ready to make  bargain with the ghost, and accordingly he entered warmly into the spirit of the transaction. He pledged his faith, his life. She accepted it, giving him a ring from her spectral hand, and in exchange borrowed the king's neck ornament. The monarch was rather unprepared for this, but the vision having got all she wanted, conveniently rendered herself invisible, and Dunmail felt he was blackmailed upon his own highway.</p>
<p>In a short time Leolf had succeeded in arousing the adherents, but the king was again wandering by Windermere, when a Saxon soldier encountered him, and attempted to seize him. He got the poor king down, and, after the manner of James and Roderick Dhu, desired him to yield. At that moment a young and lovely girl appeared upon the scene, and, casting herself before the soldier, implored mercy.</p>
<p>But the Saxon, it appeared, had been in pursuit of his damsel, in which case her rashness in venturing within reach is unaccountable, and he proceeded to despatch the king first before "drying her tears." But the damsel just then fortunately perceived the king's dagger, which had dropped. Seizing it, she stabbed the soldier in the back, and &#8212;</p>
<poem>
<line>"Unwounded from the dreadful close,</line>
<line>But breathless all, <i>the king</i> arose;"</line>
</poem>
<p>and then away the merry maiden and the monarch hurried to Patterdale, where they learnt that the Saxon had managed to live long enough to put soldiers on their track. But the rising of Dunmail's men succeeded. The Saxon's were routed, and the king, flushed with success, determined to set morality at defiance and to raise the beautiful Guonoline to a seat beside the throne. As he was already married, this conduct was resented, and caused a deadly feud between his wife's relations and the king. Dunmail put everything aside in his desire to win the lovely Guonoline, and, notwithstanding a supernatural warning, declined to alter the plans he had made to carry her off, if she were quite innocent. A vision in his castle warned him, and when it disappeared he found a messenger informing him that the Saxons were advancing upon him. He did all he could to gather his men, but, his whole attention having been lately fixed upon an unworthy object, nothing was prepared. His men were surprised near the fort of Helvellyn. He himself fell fighting, and all were buried where they fell. The cairn still exists, and even now when the wintry wind rages over the fells the phantom of the king may be seen pursuing a beautiful damsel arrayed in white, "who ever and anon seems within his grasp, but as he stretches forth his hand to seize her she vanishes in a snow-wreath."</p>
<p>It is reported of Guonoline that the female Druid carried her off in safety from the castle, and that she married and brought up a numerous family. But of this the old tradition is uncertain. Such is the legend of Dunmail Raise, and we think the moral is a very obvious one and a very food one too.</p>
<gap desc="asterisks"/>
<p>We read this little legend aloud before we started on our way to Keswick, which we did by the coach. Under these circumstances we were unable to add a stone to the king's cairn, or the explore the beauties of Thirlmere Lake, from which Manchester derives its water supply. The lake is well worth seeing from the path on the western bank. Once upon a time the trees stood here so thickly that it is said a squirrel could go from Wythburn <pb n="426"/> to Keswick without touching the ground. It is not much out of the direct road to traverse this cart track, and from it only can the beautiful if somewhat sombre surroundings of Thirlmere be appreciated.</p>
<p>Keswick is well furnished with hotels, but we have always pushed on to Lodore, where close by the splashing and dashing waterfall we have the lake before us and Borrowdale at hand to ramble in. Borrowdale is very attractive, and much could be said of it, but our notes must soon be brought to a conclusion. There are one or two excursions which we would indicate before turning homewards, and we must not fail to recount our great expedition in the storm across the Honister Pass, and the various routes that can be taken by pedestrians.</p>
<p>There was an otter hunt the morning after we arrived at Lodore, and everybody who possessed a dog, and several people who did not, went forth to hunt the wily otter. But he proved one too many for all of us, and, after much beated and a great deal of walking and leaping and ferrying across arms of the lake, the hunt was relinquished, and a visit to Keswick by water indulged in, to see the pencils made, and to get our names and those of our friends printed in gold letters upon the cedar tubes.</p>
<p>Keswick is indissolubly associated with Southey, and his letters dated from there give us many glimpses of his intercourse with Wordsworth. Before Southey came to Greta Hall, Samuel Taylor Coleridge inhabited it. "On our right the lovely vale, on our left Derwentwater, Lodore in full view, and the fantastic mountains of Borrowdale." Of Borrowdale and Derwentwater and its picturesque island pages might be written, even as we are seated for a pleasant hour beneath the historical yews of the Dale. Many a time have we wandered alone and in company into Borrowdale, and thence to the Sty-head Pass to Wastwater. Those who do not mind from twelve to eighteen miles walk will do well to stroll up the Sty-head Pass, and on to Strands to see the "Screes" above the lake in all their varied colouring.</p>
<p>All tourists will of course drive to Buttermere, but those who want a walk will leave the car at the end of the lake and ascend the hillside to get a peep into the Valley of Liza, with Scarf Gap and Black Sail Passes, and the beautifully set if gloomy Lake of Ennerdale at the end of the valley. Here the scenery is really imposing, and the tramp across to Wastwater can be accomplished without any difficulty in fine weather. We venture to predict that those who will go out of the more beaten track to Ennerdale will not complain of the little extra exertion they will encounter.</p>
<p>But on the occasion which I have more immediately in mind we continued our quiet way to Buttermere and Newlands. We saw a waterfall by Crummock Water, and we missed our two companions. We had had a sharp storm in the Honister Pass, and one umbrella had been found sufficient for our "pair" of turtles. But they could not have been wafted away upon it, although it had been in requisition. They were found at last seated on a rock decidedly small for two people under ordinary circumstances, but still under the umbrella &#8212; for shade this time, and not for shelter. Rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes and hands just touching, so as to facilitate the transfer of a ring &#8212; we saw so much, no more! It was enough. The pair had settled all their plans, but henceforth our wanderings were made towards home.</p>
<p>We felt constrained to return homewards, and our time was delightfully spent at Ullswater, and varied by the trip over the Kirkstone Pass to Low Wood and Windermere. Here the unromantic train received us, and our wanderings in Wordsworthshire were over. But the "pair," since reduced to one by matrimonal bonds, are at this moment studying the "Practical Guide to the Lakes," with a view to another excursion before the honeymoon has quite waned, and actually want us to go with them!</p>
