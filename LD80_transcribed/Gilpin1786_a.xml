<p>From Gar&#8747;tang to Lanca&#8747;ter there is little change in the land&#8747;cape.  It &#8747;till continues bleak and unplea&#8747;ant.  But as we now approached the mountains, every object began to proclaim the rugged &#8747;cenes, into which we were entering.  The country we now traver&#8747;ed, may be called a kind of connecting thread: it&#8747;elf of an uncharacterized &#8747;pecies, &#8747;triking us with no determined features.  It has neither the grandeur of the mountain &#8747;cene; nor the chearfulne&#8747;s of the &#8747;ylvan: what wood there is, is poor, and &#8747;hrivelled.  For we now &#8747;kirted the bay of Cartmel, and the &#8747;ea-air having caught the trees, had impoveri&#8747;hed their foliage, &#8747;tinted their growth, and de&#8747;troyed their very form, with unu&#8747;ual rigour.</p>
<pb n="75"/>
<p>At a mile's di&#8747;tance Lanca&#8747;ter-ca&#8747;tle ri&#8747;es to view.  It's lofty &#8747;ituation, it's ma&#8747;&#8747;y towers, and exten&#8747;ive buildings (for it is connected with the church) give an air of grandeur to it's appearance: but as parts are neither well &#8747;haped, nor well combined, it is but an indifferent object from any point.  On the &#8747;pot, the mo&#8747;t beautiful part is a noble front; which, with it's other grand appendages, afford &#8747;ufficient matter for the curio&#8747;ity of an antiquarian.</p>
<p>On the other &#8747;ide of the town the river Lune, which is a noble piece of water, when the tide is full, &#8747;ufficiently adorns the land&#8747;cape.</p>
<p>But here the Lune is a bu&#8747;y, noi&#8747;y &#8747;cene, banked with quays; covered with &#8747;hipping; and re&#8747;ounding with nautic clamour.  Far otherwi&#8747;e is it's pa&#8747;&#8747;age, a few miles above, through the vale of Lond&#8747;dale; where quietly, and unob&#8747;erved, it winds around projecting rocks -- forms circling boundaries to meadows, pa&#8747;tured with cattle -- or pa&#8747;&#8747;es through groves and thickets, which, in fabulous times, might have been the haunt of wood-gods.  In one part, taking a &#8747;udden turn it circles a little, delicious &#8747;pot, forming it into a penin&#8747;ula,
<pb n="76"/>
called vulgarly, <i>the wheel of Lune</i>.  Here once dwelt an ancient hermit; where his eyes &#8747;aw nothing, nor wi&#8747;hed to &#8747;ee any thing, except the &#8747;weet vale, in which he lived.</p>
<p>From the ca&#8747;tle-hill, or rather from the church-yard, we had a very exten&#8747;ive view, compo&#8747;ed of the grande&#8747;t objects.  Along the meadows below, the river Lune, now an e&#8747;tuary, and adorned with a variety of coasting ve&#8747;&#8747;els, (le&#8747;&#8747;ening to the eye, through it's &#8747;everal reaches,) ha&#8747;tens to the &#8747;ea.  In a mile or two, it enters the bay of Cartmel; which filled with the tide, pre&#8747;ents a noble extent of water, ten or twelve miles acro&#8747;s, bounded by the mountains of Furne&#8747;s; which extend through va&#8747;t &#8747;pace; and then circling the head of the bay, form many a &#8747;hooting promontory, and many a winding &#8747;hore.</p>
<p>This exten&#8747;ion of wild country we looked at with regret, knowing the many noble &#8747;cenes it contained, which we had not had time to vi&#8747;it.  We were obliged to re&#8747;t &#8747;atisfied with forming imaginary pictures among the blue mi&#8747;ts of the mountains.  Our guide, an unlettered &#8747;wain, pointed out, in the broad dialect of his country, the &#8747;everal &#8747;pots -- where the ruins of Furne&#8747;s-abbey lay &#8747;eque&#8747;tered in a lowly vales -- where, far
<pb n="77"/>
to the we&#8747;t, Peel-ca&#8747;tle, running boldly out into the water, commanded the entrance of the bay -- where, deep beneath tho&#8747;e purpli&#8747;h mountains, the lake of Coni&#8747;ton occupied a valley &#8747;ix miles in length -- where Holker-hall; and Bard&#8747;ey; and Coni&#8747;hed, founded on the &#8747;ite of an ancient priory; and many other places of renowned &#8747;ituation, were all &#8747;urrounded with &#8747;cenes of grandeur; and each, as far as we could judge from our intelligence, with &#8747;cenes peculiar to it&#8747;elf.</p>
<p>From Lanca&#8747;ter, in our rout to Kendal, the country, every &#8747;tep, becomes more characteri&#8747;tic.  High, &#8747;helving grounds ari&#8747;e on the right; and on the left, at every opening, we have different views of the bay of Cartmel, and of the mountains of Furne&#8747;s.  The fore-ground is every where adorned with large, detached &#8747;tones; which indicate the rocks we approach.</p>
<p>A little beyond Burton we left the great road and took a circuit of two or three miles to &#8747;ee the country about Milthorp, and Levens.</p>
<pb n="78"/>
<p>Cartmel-bay branches here into a creek; on the ea&#8747;tern &#8747;ide of which lies Milthorp; a little coa&#8747;ting-port-town; and near it Dalham-tower, in a plea&#8747;ant park, defended by a hill from the &#8747;ea-air.  All around we have beautiful views, con&#8747;i&#8747;ting of woody &#8747;ore-grounds, and of di&#8747;tances compo&#8747;ed of different parts of this little e&#8747;tuary, and it's appendant mountains.</p>
<p>As we proceeded higher up the creek, the views, increa&#8747;ed in beauty.  About Levens, a &#8747;eat of the early of Suffolk, there is a happy combination of every thing that is <i>lovely</i> and <i>great</i> in land&#8747;cape.  It &#8747;tands at the head of the creek, upon the Kenet, a wild romantic &#8747;tream, which ru&#8747;hes into the tide, a little below.  The hou&#8747;e, incompa&#8747;&#8747;ed with hilly grounds, is well &#8747;creened from the pernicious effects of the &#8747;ea-air.  But we did not ride up to it.  The woods with which it abounds, we were told, grow luxuriantly; and the views at hand are as plea&#8747;ing, as tho&#8747;e at a di&#8747;tance, are great; which con&#8747;i&#8747;t of a lengthened beach of &#8747;and along the creek; and of Whitbarrow-cragg, a rough, and very picture&#8747;que promontory; with other high lands, &#8747;hooting into the bay.</p>
<pb n="79"/>
<p>Among the beautiful objects of di&#8747;tance, we con&#8747;ider a winding &#8747;and-beach, e&#8747;pecially when &#8747;een from a woody fore-ground.  It's hue, amid the verdure of foliage, is a plea&#8747;ant, cha&#8747;ti&#8747;ing tint.  When the tide flows, the &#8747;ands change their appearance, and take the &#8747;till more plea&#8747;ing form of a noble lake.</p>
<p>Levens is at pre&#8747;ent in a neglected &#8747;tate: but is certainly capable of being made equal to almo&#8747;t any &#8747;cene in England.</p>
<p>From hence we proceeded to Kendal; &#8747;ituated in a wild, unplea&#8747;ant country, which contains no &#8747;triking objects; and cannot be formed into any of tho&#8747;e plea&#8747;ing combinations, which con&#8747;titute a picture.  Here and there a view may be found; though but &#8747;eldom.  The ca&#8747;tle, which is a mere ruin, is in &#8747;ome &#8747;ituations, e&#8747;pecially near the bridge, a good object.</p>
<p>Between Kendal and Amble&#8747;ide, the wood increa&#8747;es in grandeur; but the &#8747;cenery is &#8747;till undetermined.  The whole is a &#8747;ort of confu&#8747;ed greatne&#8747;s.</p>
<pb n="80"/>
<p>As we de&#8747;cend to the left, we approach Windermere, where a different &#8747;pecies of country &#8747;ucceeds.  The wild mountains, which were &#8747;o ill-ma&#8747;&#8747;ed, and of a kind &#8747;o unaccommodating to land&#8747;cape, are left behind; and the road dips into a lovely &#8747;ylvan &#8747;cene, leading interchangeably through clo&#8747;e groves, under wooded hills, and along the banks of the lake.</p>

<p>WE had now arrived on the confines of tho&#8747;e romantic &#8747;cenes, which were the principal inducement to this tour.  Here therefore we propo&#8747;ed to make &#8747;ome pau&#8747;e; and pay a little more attention to the country, than a ha&#8747;ty pa&#8747;&#8747;age through it, would allow.</p>
<p>But to render a de&#8747;cription of the&#8747;e &#8747;cenes more intelligible; and to &#8747;hew more di&#8747;tinctly the &#8747;ources of that kind of beauty, with which they abound; it may be proper, before we examine the &#8747;cenes them&#8747;elves, to take a &#8747;ort of analytical view of the materials, which compo&#8747;e them -- <i>mountains</i> -- <i>lakes</i> -- <i>broken grounds</i> -- <i>wood</i> -- <i>rocks</i> -- <i>ca&#8747;cades</i> -- <i>vallies</i> -- and <i>rivers</i>.</p>
<p>With regard to <i>mountains</i>, it may be fir&#8747;t premi&#8747;ed, that, in a picture&#8747;que view, we con&#8747;ider them only as <i>di&#8747;tant</i> objects; their enor-
<pb n="82"/>
mous &#8747;ize di&#8747;qualifying them for objects at hand.  In the removed part of a picture therefore, the mountain properly appears; where it's immen&#8747;ity, reduced by di&#8747;tance, can be taken in by the eye; and it's mon&#8747;trous features, lo&#8747;ing their deformity, a&#8747;&#8747;ume a &#8747;oftne&#8747;s which naturally belongs not to them.</p>
<p>I would not however be under&#8747;tood to mean, that a mountain is proper only to clo&#8747;e an <i>extended</i> view.  It may take it's &#8747;tation in a &#8747;econd, or third di&#8747;tance with equal propriety.  And even on a fore-ground, a rugged corner of it's ba&#8747;e may be introduced; tho it's upper regions a&#8747;pire far beyond the limits of an picture.</p>
<p>Having thus premi&#8747;ed the <i>&#8747;tation</i>, which a mountain properly occupies in land&#8747;cape, we &#8747;hall now examine the <i>mountain</i> it&#8747;elf; in which, four things particularly &#8747;trike us -- it's <i>line</i> -- the <i>objects</i>, which adorn it's &#8747;urface -- it's <i>tints</i> -- and it's <i>light</i> and <i>&#8747;hade</i>.</p>
<p>The beauty of a di&#8747;tant mountain in a great mea&#8747;ure, depends on the line it traces along
<pb n="82.1"/>

<pb n="83"/>
the &#8747;ky; which is generally of a lighter hue.  The pyramidal &#8747;hape, and ea&#8747;y flow of an irregular line, will be found in the mountain, as in other delineations, the true&#8747;t &#8747;ource of beauty.</p>
<p>Mountains therefore ri&#8747;ing in regular, mathematical lines, or in whim&#8747;ical, grote&#8747;que &#8747;hapes, are di&#8747;plea&#8747;ing.  Thus <i>Burn&#8747;wark</i>, a mountain on the &#8747;outhern border of Scotland; <i>Thorp-Cloud</i>, near Dovedale in Derby&#8747;hire, e&#8747;pecially when &#8747;een from the garden at Ilam; and a mountain in Cumberland, which from it's peculiar appearance in &#8747;ome &#8747;ituations, takes the name of <i>Saddle-back</i>, all form di&#8747;agreeable lines.  And thus many of the pointed &#8747;ummits of the <i>Alps</i> are objects rather of &#8747;ingularity, than of beauty.  Such forms al&#8747;o as &#8747;ugge&#8747;t the idea of a lumpi&#8747;h <i>heavine&#8747;s</i> are di&#8747;gu&#8747;ting -- round, &#8747;welling forms, without any break to di&#8747;incumber them of their weight.</p>
<p>Indeed a continuity of line without a break, whether it be <i>concave</i>, <i>straight</i>, or <i>convex</i>, will always di&#8747;plea&#8747;e, becau&#8747;e it wants variety; unle&#8747;s indeed it be well contra&#8747;ted with other forms.  The effect al&#8747;o of a broken line is bad, if the breaks are regular.</p>
<pb n="84"/>
<p>The objects, which cover the &#8747;urface of mountains, are wood, rocks, broken ground, heath, and mo&#8747;&#8747;es of various hues.</p>
<p>Ovid has very ingeniou&#8747;ly given us the furniture of a mountain in the transformation of Atlas.</p>

<p>His hair and beard become trees, and other vegetable &#8747;ub&#8747;tance; his bones, rocks; and his head, and &#8747;houlders, &#8747;ummits, and promontories. --But to de&#8747;cribe minutely the <i>parts</i> of a <i>distant</i> object (for we are con&#8747;idering a mountain in this light) would be to invert the rules of per&#8747;pective, by making that <i>di&#8747;tinct</i>, which &#8747;hould be <i>ob&#8747;cure</i>.  I &#8747;hall con&#8747;ider therefore all that variety, which covers the &#8747;urface of di&#8747;tant mountains, as blended together in one ma&#8747;s; and made the &#8747;tratum of tho&#8747;e tints, which we often find playing upon them.</p>
<p>The&#8747;e tints, which are the mo&#8747;t beautiful ornaments of the mountain, are of all colours; but the mo&#8747;t prevalent are yellow, and purple.  We can hardly con&#8747;ider <i>blue</i> as a mountain-tint.  It is the mere colour of the intervening

air -- the hue, which naturally inve&#8747;ts all di&#8747;tant objects, as well as mountains.  The late Dr. Brown, author of the E&#8747;timate, in a de&#8747;cription, which he printed, of the lake of Ke&#8747;wick, very ju&#8747;tly calls the&#8747;e tints <i>the yellow &#8747;treams of light, the purple hues, and mi&#8747;ty azure of the mountains</i>.  They are rarely permanent; but &#8747;eem to be a &#8747;ort of floating, &#8747;ilky colours -- always in motion -- always in harmony -- and playing with a thousand changeable varieties into each other.  They are literally <i>colours dipped in heaven</i>.</p>
<p>The variety of the&#8747;e tints depends on many circum&#8747;tances -- the &#8747;ea&#8747;on of the year -- the hour of the day -- a dry, or moi&#8747;t atmo&#8747;phere.  The <i>lines</i> and <i>&#8747;hapes</i> of mountains (features &#8747;trongly marked) are ea&#8747;ily caught and retained: but the&#8747;e meteor-forms, this rich fluctuation of airy hues, offer &#8747;uch a profu&#8747;ion of variegated &#8747;plendor, that they are continually illuding the eye with breaking into each other; and are lo&#8747;t, as it endeavours to retain them.  This airy colouring, tho in &#8747;un&#8747;hine it appears mo&#8747;t brilliant; yet in &#8747;ome degree it is <i>generally</i> found in tho&#8747;e mountains, where it prevails.</p>
<p>In the late voyages round the world, publi&#8747;hed by Dr. Hawk&#8747;worth, we have an account
<pb n="87"/>
of the great beauty of the colouring ob&#8747;erved on the peak of Teneriffe.  "It's appearance at "&#8747;un-&#8747;et, &#8747;ays the author, was very &#8747;riking.  When the &#8747;un was below the horizon, and the re&#8747;t of the i&#8747;land appeared of a deep black;  the mountain &#8747;till reflected his rays, and glowed with a warmth of colouring, which  no painting can expre&#8747;s."</p>
<p>The rays of the &#8747;un, which are the cau&#8747;e of all colour, no doubt, produce the&#8747;e tints to the eye; yet we mu&#8747;t believe there is &#8747;omething peculiar in the &#8747;urfaces of &#8747;ome mountains, which di&#8747;po&#8747;e them to reflect the rays with &#8747;uch variety of tints.  On many mountains the&#8747;e appearances are not ob&#8747;ervable; and where the &#8747;urface is uniform, the tint will be &#8747;o likewi&#8747;e.  "The effect in que&#8747;tion, says Mr. Lock, remarking on this pa&#8747;&#8747;age, is very familiar to me.  I &#8747;aw it almo&#8747;t every evening in Savoy, when the &#8747;un &#8747;hone.  It is only on the tops of the highe&#8747;t mountains, that the effect is perfect.  Mount Blanc being covered with the pure&#8747;t &#8747;now, and having no tint of it's own, was often of the brighte&#8747;t ro&#8747;e-colour."</p>
<p>Having thus given the mountain a line; filled it with objects; and &#8747;pread over it a beau-
<pb n="88"/>
tiful a&#8747;&#8747;emblage of tins; it remains la&#8747;tly to throw the whole into light and &#8747;hade.--He who would &#8747;tudy light and &#8747;hade, mu&#8747;t repair to the mountains.  There he will &#8747;ee their mo&#8747;t magnificent effects.</p>
<p>In every object we ob&#8747;erve a double effect of illumination, that of the <i>parts</i>, and that of the <i>whole</i>.  In a building the cornices, the pila&#8747;ters, and other ornaments, <i>are &#8747;et off</i>, in the language of art, with light and &#8747;hade.  Over this <i>partial</i> effect are &#8747;pread the <i>general</i> ma&#8747;&#8747;es.  It is thus in mountains.</p>
<p>Homer, who had a genius as picture&#8747;que as Virgil, (tho he &#8747;eems to have known little of <i>the art of painting</i>) was &#8747;truck with two things in his views of mountains -- with tho&#8747;e cavities and projections, which abound upon their &#8747;urfaces -- and with what he calls their <i>&#8747;hadowing forms</i>.  Of the former, he takes notice, when he &#8747;peaks of a &#8747;ingle mountain; of the latter, when he &#8747;peaks of mountains in combination<ptr target="n1"/>.  Now it is plain, that in both the&#8747;e
<pb n="89"/>

ca&#8747;es he was plea&#8747;ed with the effect of light and &#8747;hade.  In one the <i>partial</i> effect is marked: in the other, the <i>general</i>.</p>
<note id="n1"><p>Under the fir&#8747;t idea he &#8747;peaks of Mount Olympus, which he calls <unclear>&#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#960;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#945;</unclear>, or <i>many vallied</i>.

<p>The cavities which he ob&#8747;erved, and which are &#8747;een only from their being the deep rece&#8747;&#8747;es of &#8747;hade, together with the rocks, and little projections, which are vi&#8747;ible only from catching a &#8747;tronger ray of light, contribute to produce the <i>partial</i> effect -- that richne&#8747;s, and variety on the &#8747;ides of di&#8747;tant mountains, which would otherwi&#8747;e be a di&#8747;play of flat, fatiguing &#8747;urface.  The objects them&#8747;elves are formle&#8747;s, and indi&#8747;tinct; yet, by pre&#8747;enting different &#8747;urfaces for the light to reflect on, the rich and variegated effect, here mentioned, is produced.</p>
<p>The <i>grand ma&#8747;&#8747;es</i> are formed by one mountain's over-&#8747;hadowing another -- by the &#8747;un's turning round &#8747;ome promontory -- or by the tran&#8747;ver&#8747;e po&#8747;ition of mountains; in all which ca&#8747;es the &#8747;hadow falls broad and deep -- &#8747;weeps over all the &#8747;maller &#8747;hades, to which it &#8747;till,
<pb n="90"/>
gives a deeper tinge; and unites the whole in one great effect.</p>
<p>It is an agreeable amu&#8747;ement to attend the&#8747;e va&#8747;t &#8747;hadows in their &#8747;low, and &#8747;olemn march over the mountains -- to ob&#8747;erve, how the morning &#8747;un &#8747;heds only a faint catching light upon the &#8747;ummits of the hills, through one general ma&#8747;s of hazy &#8747;hade -- in a few hours how all this confu&#8747;ion is di&#8747;&#8747;ipated -- how the lights and &#8747;hades begin to break, and &#8747;eparate, and take their form and breadth -- how deep and determined the &#8747;hadows are at noon -- how fugitive and uncertain, as the &#8747;un declines; till it's fires, glowing in the we&#8747;t, light up a new radiance through the land&#8747;cape; and &#8747;pread over it, in&#8747;tead of &#8747;ober light and &#8747;hade, all the colours of nature, in one bright, momentary gleam.</p>
<p>It is equally amu&#8747;ing to ob&#8747;erve the various &#8747;hapes, which mountains a&#8747;&#8747;ume through all this variety of illumination; rocks, knolls, and promontories, taking new forms; appearing, and di&#8747;appearing, as the &#8747;un veers round;
<pb n="91"/>
who&#8747;e radiance, like varni&#8747;h on a picture, (if I may u&#8747;e a degrading compari&#8747;on,) <i>brings out</i> a thou&#8747;and objects unob&#8747;erved before.</p>
<p>To the&#8747;e more permanent effects of illumination may be added another &#8747;pecies, which ari&#8747;es from accident -- I mean tho&#8747;e partial, flitting &#8747;hades, which are occa&#8747;ioned by floating clouds.  The&#8747;e may &#8747;ometimes produce a good effect; but they contribute as often to di&#8747;turb the repo&#8747;e of a land&#8747;cape.  To painters however they are of great u&#8747;e, who are frequently obliged, by an untoward &#8747;ubject, to take the advantage of every probability to produce an effect.</p>

<p>HAVING thus con&#8747;idered the chief circum&#8747;tances, which occur in <i>di&#8747;tant mountains</i>, let us now inlarge our view, and take in the <i>lake</i>, which makes the next con&#8747;iderable part of this romantic country.</p>

<p>The <i>fe</i> is a pla&#8747;hy inundation, formed on a flat -- without depth -- without lineal boundary -- of ambiguous texture -- half water -- and half land -- a &#8747;ort of vegetable fluid.</p>
<p>The <i>pool</i> is a collection of the &#8747;oakings of &#8747;ome common; or the re&#8747;ervoir of the neighbouring ditches, which depo&#8747;it in it's ouzy bed
<pb n="94"/>
the &#8747;oid of the country, clay, or mud; and give a corre&#8747;pondent tinge to the water.</p>
<p>In &#8747;ome things the <i>fen</i> and the <i>pool</i> agree.  They both take every thing in, and let nothing out.  Each of them is in &#8747;ummer a &#8747;ink of putrefaction; and the receptacle of all tho&#8747;e unclean, mis&#8747;hapen forms in animal life, which breed and batten in the impurities of &#8747;tagnation;</p>

<p>Very different is the origin of the <i>lake</i>. It's magnificent, and marble bed, formed in the caverns and deep rece&#8747;&#8747;es of rocky mountains, received originally the pure pellucide waters of &#8747;ome ru&#8747;hing torrent, as it came fir&#8747;t from the hand of nature -- arre&#8747;ted it's cour&#8747;e, till the &#8747;pacious, and &#8747;plendid ba&#8747;on was filled brimfull; and then di&#8747;charged the &#8747;tream, un&#8747;ullied, and undimini&#8747;hed, through &#8747;ome winding vale, to form other lakes, or increa&#8747;e the dignity of &#8747;ome imperial river.  Here no impurities find entrance, either of animal, or of vegetable life:</p>

<p>From the bri&#8747;k circulation of fluid through the&#8747;e animated bodies of water, a great ma&#8747;ter of nature has nobly &#8747;tyled them, <i>living lakes:</i></p>
<poem>
	<line> -- Spelunc&#230;</line>
	<line>Vivique lacus.--</line>
</poem>
<p>and indeed nothing, which is not really alive, de&#8747;erves the appellation better.  For be&#8747;ides the vital &#8747;tream, which principally feeds them, they receive a thou&#8747;and little gurgling rills, which trickling through a thou&#8747;and veins, give life, and &#8747;pirit to every part.</p>
<p>The principal incidents ob&#8747;ervable in <i>lakes</i>, are, their <i>line of boundary</i> -- their <i>i&#8747;lands</i> -- and the different appearances of the <i>&#8747;urface</i> of the water.</p>
<p>The <i>line of boundary</i> is very various.  Sometimes it is boldly broken by a projecting promontory -- &#8747;ometimes indented by a creek -- &#8747;ometimes it undulates by an irregular &#8747;hore -- and &#8747;ometimes &#8747;wells into a winding bay.  In each of the&#8747;e circum&#8747;tances it is &#8747;u&#8747;ceptible of beauty; in all, it certainly de&#8747;erves attention: for as it is of cour&#8747;e &#8747;o con&#8747;picuous a boundary, that the lea&#8747;t har&#8747;hne&#8747;s in it is di&#8747;cernible.  I
<pb n="96"/>
have known many a good land&#8747;cape injured by a bad water boundary.</p>
<p>This line, it may be further ob&#8747;erved, varies under different circum&#8747;tances.  When the eye is placed <i>upon</i> the lake, the line of boundary is a <i>circular thread</i>, with little undulation; unle&#8747;s when &#8747;ome promontory of more than u&#8747;ual magnitude &#8747;hoots into the water.  All &#8747;maller irregularities are lo&#8747;t.  The particular beauty of it under this circum&#8747;tance, con&#8747;i&#8747;ts in the oppo&#8747;ition between &#8747;uch a <i>thread</i>, and the irregular line formed by the &#8747;ummits of the mountains.</p>
<p>But when the eye is placed on the higher grounds, <i>above</i> the level of the lake, the line of boundary takes a new form; and what appeared to the <i>levelled</i> eye a circular thread, becomes <i>now</i> an undulating line, projecting, and retiring more or le&#8747;s, according to the degree of the eye's elevation.  The circular thread was indebted for it's principal beauty to contra&#8747;t: but this, like all other elegant lines, has the additional beauty of variety.</p>
<p>And yet, in <i>&#8747;ome</i> ca&#8747;es, the <i>levelled</i> eye has the advantage of the <i>elevated</i> one.  The line, which forms an acute angle from the <i>higher</i> &#8747;ituation,
<pb n="97"/>
may be &#8747;oftened, when &#8747;een from the water, into an ea&#8747;y curve.</p>
<p>The <i>i&#8747;lands</i> fall next under our view.  The&#8747;e are either beauty, or a deformity to the lake; as they are &#8747;haped, or &#8747;tationed.</p>
<p>If the i&#8747;land be round, or of any other regular form; or if the wood upon it be thick and heavy (as I have ob&#8747;erved &#8747;ome planted with a clo&#8747;e grove of Scotch fir) it can never be an object of beauty.  At <i>hand</i>, it is a heavy lump: at a <i>di&#8747;tance</i>, a murky &#8747;pot.</p>
<p>Again, if the i&#8747;land, (however beautifully &#8747;haped, or planted;) be &#8747;eated in the centre of a round lake; in the focus of an oval one; or in any other <i>regular</i> po&#8747;ition; the beauty of it is lo&#8747;t, at lea&#8747;t in &#8747;ome points of view.</p>
<p>But when it's lines, and &#8747;hape are both irregular -- when it is ornamented with ancient oak, rich in foliage, but light and airy -- and when it takes &#8747;ome irregular &#8747;ituation in the lake; then it is an object truly beautiful -- beautiful in it&#8747;elf, as well as in compo&#8747;ition.  It mu&#8747;t however be added, that it would be difficult to place &#8747;uch an object in any &#8747;ituation, that would be <i>equally</i> plea&#8747;ing to every &#8747;tand.</p>
<pb n="98"/>
<p>The <i>&#8747;urface of the lake</i> offers it&#8747;elf la&#8747;t to ob&#8747;ervation.  The &#8747;everal incidents, which ari&#8747;e here, are all owing to the &#8747;ky, and the di&#8747;po&#8747;ition of the water to receive it's impre&#8747;&#8747;ion.</p>
<p>That the &#8747;ky is the great regulator of the <i>colour</i> of the water, is known to all arti&#8747;ts.</p>
<poem>
	<line>Olli c&#230;ruleus &#8747;upra caput a&#8747;titit imber,</line>

</poem>
<p>The effect indeed holds univer&#8747;allyy; as water in all ca&#8747;es, expo&#8747;ed to the &#8747;ky, will act as a mirror to it.</p>
<p>In the darkne&#8747;s of a brooding &#8747;torm, we have ju&#8747;t &#8747;een, the <i>whole body</i> of the water will be dark: <i>inhorruit unda tenebris</i>.</p>
<p>In clear, and windy weather, the <i>breezy ruffled lake</i>, as Thom&#8747;on calls it, is a &#8747;hattered mirror: It reflects the &#8747;erenity; but reflects it partially.  The hollow of each wave is commonly in &#8747;hadow, the &#8747;ummit is tipped with light.  The light or &#8747;hadow therefore prevails, according to the po&#8747;ition of the waves to the
<pb n="99"/>
eye: and at a di&#8747;tance, when the &#8747;ummits of the waves, agreeably to the rules of per&#8747;pective, appear in <i>contact</i>, the whole &#8747;urface in that part will be light.</p>
<p>But when the &#8747;ky is &#8747;plendid, and at the &#8747;ame times calm, the water (being then a <i>perfect</i> mirror,) will glow all over with corre&#8747;pondent tints; unle&#8747;s other reflections, from the objects around, intervene, and form more vivid pictures.</p>
<p>Often you will &#8747;ee a &#8747;pacious bay, &#8747;creened by &#8747;ome projecting promontory, in perfect repo&#8747;e; while the re&#8747;t of the lake, more pervious to the air, is cri&#8747;ped over by a gentle ripple.</p>
<p>Sometimes al&#8747;o, when the <i>whole</i> lake is tranquil, a gentle perturbation will ari&#8747;e in &#8747;ome di&#8747;tant part, from no apparent cau&#8747;e, from a breath of air, which nothing el&#8747;e can feel, and creeping &#8747;oftly on, communicate the tremulous &#8747;hudder with exqui&#8747;ite &#8747;en&#8747;ibility over half the &#8747;urface.  In this ob&#8747;ervation I do little more than tran&#8747;late from Ovid:</p>
<poem>
	<line>--Exhorruit, &#230;quoris in&#8747;tar,</line>
	<line>Quod fremit, exigua cum &#8747;ummum &#8747;tringitur aura.</line>
</poem>
<p>No pool, no river-bay, can pre&#8747;ent this idea in it's utmo&#8747;t purity.  In them every cry&#8747;talline particle is &#8747;et, as it were, in a &#8747;ocket of mud.
<pb n="99.1"/>
<gap desc="unclear landscape orientated oval picture"/>
 <pb n="100"/> 
Their lubricity is lo&#8747;t.  More or le&#8747;s, they all flow <i>cum gurgite flavo</i>.  But the lake, like Spencer's fountain, which &#8747;prang from the limpid tears of a nymph,</p>
<poem>
	<line>--is cha&#8747;t, and pure, as pure&#8747;t &#8747;now,</line>
	<line>Ne lets her waves with any filth be dyed.</line>
</poem>
<p>Refined thus from every ob&#8747;truction, it is <i>tremblingly alive</i> all over: the mere&#8747;t trifle, a fri&#8747;king fly, a falling leaf, almo&#8747;t a &#8747;ound alarms it,</p>
<poem>
	<line>--that &#8747;ound,</line>
	<line>Which from the mountain, previous to the &#8747;torm,</line>
	<line>Rolls o'er the muttering earth, di&#8747;turbs the flood,</line>
	<line>And &#8747;hakes the fore&#8747;t-leaf without a breath.</line>
</poem>
<p>This tremulous &#8747;hudder is &#8747;ometimes even &#8747;till more partial: It will run in lengthened parallels, and &#8747;eparate the reflections upon the &#8747;urface, which are lo&#8747;t on one &#8747;ide, and taken up on the other.  This is perhaps the mo&#8747;t picture&#8747;que form, which water a&#8747;&#8747;umes; as it affords the painter an opportunity of throwing in tho&#8747;e lengthened lights and &#8747;hades, which give the greatest variety and clearne&#8747;s to water.</p>
<p>There is another appearance on the &#8747;urfaces of lakes, which we cannot account for on any principle either of optics, or of per&#8747;pective.
<pb n="101"/>
When there is no apparent cau&#8747;e in the <i>&#8747;ky</i>, the <i>water</i> will &#8747;ometimes appear dappled with large &#8747;pots of &#8747;hade.  It is po&#8747;&#8747;ible the&#8747;e patches may have connection with the bottom of the lake; as naturali&#8747;ts &#8747;uppo&#8747;e, the &#8747;hining parts of the &#8747;ea are occa&#8747;ioned by the &#8747;pawn of fi&#8747;h: but it is more probable, that in &#8747;ome way, they are connected with the &#8747;ky, as they generally e&#8747;teemed in the country to be a weather-gage.  The people will often &#8747;ay, "It will be no " hay-day to day, the lake is full of &#8747;hades." -- I never my&#8747;elf &#8747;aw this appearance; o I might be able to give a better account of it: but I have heard it &#8747;o often taken notice of; that I &#8747;uppo&#8747;e there is at lea&#8747;t &#8747;ome ground for the ob&#8747;ervation.  Tho, after all, I think it probably the&#8747;e &#8747;hades may be owing only to floating clouds.</p>
<p>From this great variety, which the &#8747;urfaces of lakes a&#8747;&#8747;ume, we may draw this conclu&#8747;ion, that the painter may take great liberties, in point of light and &#8747;hade, in his repre&#8747;entation of water.  It is, in many ca&#8747;es, under no rule, that we are acquainted with; or under rules &#8747;o
<pb n="102"/>
lax, that the imagination is left very much at large.</p>
<p>On the &#8747;ubject of <i>lakes</i>, I have only farther to add, that many bodies of water, under this denomination, are found upon the <i>&#8747;ummits</i> of lofty mountains.  In this &#8747;ituation they are commonly made ba&#8747;ons; or re&#8747;ervoirs; and want the plea&#8747;ing accompaniments, which adorn the lower lakes.  Lakes of this kind are a collection of &#8747;prings; and di&#8747;charge them&#8747;elves generally from their elevated &#8747;tations in ca&#8747;cades.</p>

<head level="1" align="center">SECT. VIII.</head>
<p>WE have now made a con&#8747;iderable advance towards a land&#8747;cape.  The &#8747;ky is laid in; a mountain fills the offskip; and a lake, with it's accompaniments, takes po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion of a nearer di&#8747;tance.  Nothing but a <i>fore-ground</i> is wanting; and for this we have great choice of objects -- <i>broken ground</i> -- <i>trees</i> -- <i>rocks</i> -- <i>ca&#8747;cades</i> -- and <i>vallies</i>.</p>
<p>In a <i>di&#8747;tance</i> the ruling character is <i>tenderne&#8747;s</i>; which on a <i>fore-ground</i>, gives way to what the painter calls <i>force</i>, and <i>richness</i>.  <i>Force</i> ari&#8747;es from a violent oppo&#8747;ition of colour, light, and &#8747;hade: <i>richne&#8747;s</i> con&#8747;i&#8747;ts in a variety of parts, and glowing tints.  In &#8747;ome degree, <i>richne&#8747;s</i> is found in a di&#8747;tance; but never, united with <i>force</i>: for in a <i>distance</i>; tho the <i>lights</i> may be &#8747;trong, and the parts varied; yet
<pb n="104"/>
the &#8747;hades and tints will ever be faint, and tender.</p>
<p>In the mean time, this oppo&#8747;ition on the fore-ground, violent as it is, mu&#8747;t always be subject to the <i>ruling ma&#8747;&#8747;es</i> of light and &#8747;hade, and colouring, which harmonize the whole.</p>
<p>The effect of this harmony is <i>breadth</i>, or <i>repo&#8747;e</i>.  It's oppo&#8747;ite is <i>flutter</i>, and <i>confu&#8747;ion</i>.</p>
<p>It appears therefore, that the management of fore-grounds is a matter of great nicety.  In them a very contradiction mu&#8747;t be reconciled: <i>breadth</i> and <i>repo&#8747;e</i>, which con&#8747;i&#8747;t in <i>uniting the parts</i>; mu&#8747;t be made to agree with <i>force</i> and <i>richne&#8747;s</i>, which con&#8747;i&#8747;t in violently <i>breaking them</i>.  And what adds to the difficulty, the eye, brought thus <i>on the &#8747;pot</i>, is hurt by the minute&#8747;t defect.  Whereas, at a <i>di&#8747;tance</i>, an irregular da&#8747;h of the pencil, if it be not one thing, may be conceived to be another: ob&#8747;curity is there a &#8747;ource of beauty. -- Hence it is, that many great ma&#8747;ters, who can throw a di&#8747;tance into a plea&#8747;ing confu&#8747;ion, and give it the effect of nature; have failed in exerci&#8747;ing their art on a fore-ground.</p>
<pb n="105"/>
<p>Having premi&#8747;ed thus much with regard to fore-grounds <i>in general</i>, let us now examine the <i>fore-grounds</i>, which are pre&#8747;ented to us in this very picture&#8747;que country.</p>
<p><i>Broken grounds</i> are the fir&#8747;t objects of our attention.  Here they abound in every &#8747;hape.  The painter will ea&#8747;ily find, either &#8747;ome rough knoll, who&#8747;e parts are ample -- the &#8747;loping corner of a hill, perhaps worn by a mountain-torrent -- a rugged road, winding through the cha&#8747;m of a rifted promontory -- or &#8747;ome other part of nature equally grand and picture&#8747;que.</p>
<p>If he chu&#8747;e to adorn his fore-ground with <i>wood</i> (and who does not?) he will find it in <i>&#8747;ome</i> parts of this country in a tolerable &#8747;tyle of greatne&#8747;s.  But, in general, the old timber is decayed or cut down; and that &#8747;ort of wood incouraged, which is the mo&#8747;t profitable -- &#8747;uch wood, as, in a cour&#8747;e of time, is turned into charcoal. It has, in &#8747;ome degree, the effect of better trees in a di&#8747;tance; but it is very deficient, when we call for an ancient oak to give the fore-
<pb n="106"/>
ground a grandeur equal to the &#8747;cene -- when we want the magnificence of it's &#8747;hadowing form to mantle over the vacant corner of a land&#8747;cape -- when we wi&#8747;h it to hid &#8747;ome heavy promontory; or to &#8747;catter a few loo&#8747;e branches over &#8747;ome ill-&#8747;haped mountain-line -- when it's ma&#8747;&#8747;y foliage is nece&#8747;&#8747;ary to give depth to &#8747;hade -- it's twi&#8747;ted bole, covered with grey mo&#8747;s, to oppo&#8747;e the vivid green in it's neighbourhood -- or, la&#8747;tly, it's warm autumnal tint to contra&#8747;t the colder hues of di&#8747;tance.  In all the&#8747;e ca&#8747;es a deficiency of fore&#8747;t-wood is &#8747;ometimes regretted in the &#8747;cenery before us; but not often: and where it is, the lo&#8747;s is ea&#8747;ily &#8747;upplied by other objects; among which rocks are the principal: and the&#8747;e, when ornamented with wood, tho of a &#8747;maller &#8747;ize, have generally the effect of the mo&#8747;t luxuriant foliage.</p>
<p><i>Rocks</i> differ in <i>&#8747;urface</i>; <i>general form</i>; and <i>colour</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>rock naturally</i> wears that <i>&#8747;mooth</i> weather-beaten &#8747;urface, which time gives it through a &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ion of ages.  But rocks, firm as they are, are &#8747;ubject to change.  Springs undermine them:  torrents wa&#8747;h the earth from around
<pb n="107"/>
them: fro&#8747;ts loo&#8747;en them; and &#8747;ometimes they are torn by &#8747;torms and earthquakes.  Under the&#8747;e circum&#8747;tances, when large ma&#8747;&#8747;es fall away, the rock exhibits a <i>fractured</i> &#8747;urface; which in general has a better effect, than the &#8747;mooth one.  Nature, in the&#8747;e in&#8747;tances, may be &#8747;aid to retouch her compo&#8747;itions: the fractured parts are larger and &#8747;harper; and better adapted to receive either &#8747;mart, catching light; or a body of light and &#8747;hade. -- An humble imitation of the &#8747;urfaces of fractured rocks is &#8747;ometimes exhibited in large coals: they may at lea&#8747;t a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;t the imagination of the painter.</p>
<p>With regard to the <i>general form</i> of rocks, both &#8747;pecies, the <i>&#8747;mooth</i>, and the <i>fractured</i>, have equal variety.  Both have their bold projections -- both hang alike over their ba&#8747;es -- are rifted into cha&#8747;ms -- and &#8747;hoot &#8747;ometimes into horizontal, and &#8747;ometimes into diagonal &#8747;trata.</p>
<p>The <i>natural colour</i> of rocks is either <i>grey</i>, or <i>red</i>.  We have of each kind in England; and both are beautiful: but the grey rock, (which is the common &#8747;pecies in <i>this</i> &#8747;cenery) makes the finer contra&#8747;t with the foliage either of &#8747;ummer, or of autumn.</p>
<pb n="108"/>
<p>I call <i>red</i>, and <i>grey</i> the natural <i>colours</i> of rocks; but more properly they are the <i>ground</i> only of a variety of tints.  The&#8747;e tints ari&#8747;e from weeds, mo&#8747;&#8747;es, and lychens of various kinds, which uniting together on the &#8747;urface of a rock, often make a rich, and very harmomonious a&#8747;&#8747;emblage of colouring; and the painter, who does not attend to the&#8747;e <i>minuti&#230;</i> (we are con&#8747;idering <i>fore-grounds</i>) lo&#8747;es half the beauty of the original.</p>
<p>Among the&#8747;e lychens, the white &#8747;pecies is the lea&#8747;t plea&#8747;ing.  When mixed with other tints, it may form an agreeable contra&#8747;t: and even, when it borrows no aid of this kind, if it be &#8747;paringly, and happily introduced, it may add a beauty to the natural colour of the <i>grey</i> rock, by giving it the brilliancy of a few &#8747;harp touches.  But when it <i>prevails</i>; and &#8747;preads, like a bald leprous &#8747;cab, over a <i>whole</i> &#8747;urface; it's mealy hue is very di&#8747;gu&#8747;ting, unle&#8747;s it be thrown into &#8747;hadow, or &#8747;upported by &#8747;ome ma&#8747;s of foliage, or other vivid tint in contact with it.</p>
<p>Be&#8747;ides the &#8747;pecies of rocks ju&#8747;t de&#8747;cribed, there is another, called the <i>cragg</i>; which conveys the idea of a rock roughly pounded.  With the&#8747;e &#8747;hattered fragments whole &#8747;ides of
<pb n="109"/>
mountains are often covered; down which they appear continually to &#8747;hiver.  This &#8747;pecies is very inferior to former.  It wants that breadth of &#8747;urface, which gives dignity to an object.  In a <i>di&#8747;tance</i> indeed, which melts the fragments into one ma&#8747;s, the effect is good: but in the &#8747;ituation, in which we are now con&#8747;idering rocks, as the appendages of a <i>fore-ground</i>, the <i>cragg</i> is meanly circum&#8747;tanced.</p>
<p>The <i>ca&#8747;cade</i>, which is the next object of our ob&#8747;ervation, may be divided into the <i>broken</i>, and the <i>regular</i> fall.</p>
<p>The <i>fir&#8747;t</i> belongs mo&#8747;t properly to the rock; who&#8747;e projecting fragments, impeding the water, break it into pieces -- da&#8747;h it into foam -- and give it all the &#8747;pirit, and agitation, which that active element is capable of receiving. -- Happy is the pencil, which can &#8747;eize the varieties, and brilliancy of water under this circum&#8747;tance.</p>
<p>In the <i>regular</i> fall the water meets no ob&#8747;truction; but pours down, from the higher grounds to the lower, in one &#8747;plendid &#8747;heet.</p>
<p>Each kind hath it's beauties; but, in general, the <i>broken</i> fall is more adapted to a &#8747;mall
<pb n="110"/>
body of water; and the <i>regular</i> to a large one.  The &#8747;mall body of water has nothing to recommend it, but it's variety and bu&#8747;tle: where-as the large body has a dignity of character to maintain.  To fritter <i>it</i> in pieces would be to de&#8747;troy in a degree the grandeur of it's effect.  Were the Niagara thus broken, at lea&#8747;t if &#8747;ome con&#8747;iderable parts of it were not left broad and &#8747;heety, it might be a grand &#8747;cene of confu&#8747;ion; but it could not be that va&#8747;t, that uniform, and &#8747;imple object, which is mo&#8747;t capable of expre&#8747;&#8747;ing the idea of greatne&#8747;s.</p>
<p>As there a few <i>con&#8747;iderable</i> rivers in the romantic country, we are now examining, the mo&#8747;t beautiful ca&#8747;cades, (which are innumerable) are generally of the <i>broken</i> kind.  The <i>regular</i> falls (of which al&#8747;o there are many) are objects of little value.  Tho they are &#8747;ometimes four of five hundred feet in height; yet they appear only like threads of &#8747;ilver at a di&#8747;tance; and like mere &#8747;pouts at hand; void both of grandeur, and variety. -- And yet, in heavy rains, &#8747;ome of them mu&#8747;t be very noble, if we may judge from their channels, which often &#8747;hew great marks of violence. -- But I was never fortunate enough to &#8747;ee any of them in the&#8747;e moment of wildne&#8747;s.</p>
<pb n="111"/>
<p>The&#8747;e two kinds of ca&#8747;cades, the <i>broken</i>, and the <i>regular</i>, may be combined.  If the weight of water be &#8747;mall, it is true, it will admit only the <i>broken</i> fall: but if it be large, it may with propriety admit a combination of both: and the&#8747;e combinations may be multiplied into each other with endle&#8747;s variety.</p>
<p>The <i>regular</i> fall admits al&#8747;o another mode of variety by forming it&#8747;elf into what may be called the <i>&#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ive fall</i>; in which the water, in&#8747;tead of making one continued &#8747;hoot, falls through a &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ion of different &#8747;tories.  Of this kind are many of the mountain-ca&#8747;cades in this country, which are often very beautiful; e&#8747;pecially where the &#8747;tages are deranged; and the water <i>&#8747;eeks</i> it's way from one &#8747;tage to another.</p>
<p>This is the &#8747;pecies of ca&#8747;cade, which was the great object of imitation in all the antiquated water-works of the la&#8747;t age.  Our fore-fathers admired the <i>&#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ive fall</i>; and, agreeably to their awkward mode of imitation, made the water de&#8747;cend a <i>regular</i> flight of &#8747;tone-&#8747;tairs.</p>
<p>Before we conclude the &#8747;ubject of ca&#8747;cades, it may be ob&#8747;erved, that, as in other objects of beauty, &#8747;o in this, proportion mu&#8747;t be a
<pb n="112"/>
regulating principle.  I &#8747;hall not be &#8747;o preci&#8747;e as to &#8747;ay, what is the exact proportion of an elegant ca&#8747;cade.  Nor is it nece&#8747;&#8747;ary.  The <i>eye</i> will ea&#8747;ily &#8747;ee the enormity of <i>disproportion</i>, where it exi&#8747;ts in any great degree: and that is enough.  Thus when a mountain-ca&#8747;cade falls four or five hundred feet, and is perhaps &#8747;carce two yards broad; every eye mu&#8747;t &#8747;ee the di&#8747;proportion: as it will al&#8747;o, when the whole breadth of &#8747;ome large river falls only two or three feet.  Both would be more beautiful, if their falls held a nearer proportion to their quantities of water.</p>
<p>The la&#8747;t &#8747;pecies of <i>fore-grounds</i> are <i>vallies</i><ptr target="n2"/>; with regard to which it mu&#8747;t be remarked fir&#8747;t, that <i>narrow contracted vallies</i> only are meant.  The open valley mu&#8747;t cla&#8747;s it&#8747;elf among objects of <i>di&#8747;tant</i> &#8747;cenery.</p>
<note id="n2">Let it be ob&#8747;erved, that the terms <i>vale</i>, and <i>valley</i>; denote univer&#8747;ally, through this work, the greater, and &#8747;maller &#8747;cenes of the &#8747;ame kind.  I con&#8747;ider <i>valley</i> as the diminutive of <i>vale</i>.</note>
<p>It mu&#8747;t &#8747;econdly be remarked, that even <i>contracted valleys</i> are not <i>purely</i> of the nature of
<pb n="112.1"/>
<gap desc="unclear landscape orientated oval picture"/>
<pb n="113"/>
fore-grounds, but <i>participate</i> of di&#8747;tance.  One &#8747;ide-&#8747;creen mu&#8747;t nece&#8747;&#8747;arily be a little <i>removed</i>, if you would give your &#8747;cenery the advantage of per&#8747;pective.</p>
<p>The&#8747;e things being premi&#8747;ed, we may con&#8747;ider the <i>valley</i> as a &#8747;pecies of <i>fore-ground</i>; the ingredients of which Spencer hath given us in very few words.</p>
<poem>
	<line>Through woods, and mountains wild they came at la&#8747;t</line>
	<line>Into a plea&#8747;ant dale, that lowly lay</line>
	<line>Betwixt two hills, who&#8747;e high heads over placed,</line>
	<line>The valley did with cool &#8747;hade overca&#8747;t:</line>
	<line>Through mid&#8747;t thereof a little river rolled.</line>
</poem>
<p>The&#8747;e ingredients admit great variety in compo&#8747;ition.  The &#8747;ides of the valley may be high, or low; rocky, or woody; &#8747;mooth, or full of jutting promontories: and the&#8747;e variations again may play into each other with a thou&#8747;and interchanges.</p>
<p>When we find a concurrence of beautiful circum&#8747;tances in the&#8747;e &#8747;cenes -- when their &#8747;ides are well proportioned, and picture&#8747;quely adorned -- and e&#8747;pecially when they are &#8747;o fortunate as to open on a rich di&#8747;tance; a lake bounded by a rocky mountain; or any other intere&#8747;ting object, they form a land&#8747;cape of a very plea&#8747;ing kind.</p>
<pb n="114"/>
<p>The rivers al&#8747;o with which the&#8747;e vallies &#8747;carce ever fail of being adorned, have the &#8747;ame variety as the hills; and may, now and then, be introduced very happily to a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;t the fore-ground.  They are pure chry&#8747;talline &#8747;treams -- generally &#8747;parkling over beds of pebbles -- often tumbling, and foaming over the ledges of rocks -- and forming, through the whole of their cour&#8747;e, a continuation of little bu&#8747;tling ca&#8747;cades.</p>
<p>Nearly allied to the <i>contracted valley</i>, is, what in <i>this</i> country, is called a <i>gill</i>; in <i>others</i>, a <i>dell</i>.  It is a narrow cleft, winding between two rocky precipices; and overgrown with wood, which clo&#8747;es at the top, and almo&#8747;t excludes the day.  Through the bottom foams a torrent.  You hear it &#8747;ounding in it's fall from one rocky &#8747;tage to another: but it is rarely vi&#8747;ible.</p>
<p>The&#8747;e romantic &#8747;pots are generally impervious.  When they are a little more open, &#8747;o as to allow a narrow foot-path to &#8747;tray among them, they are the mo&#8747;t beloved haunts of &#8747;olitude and meditation; and of all the parts
<pb n="115"/>
of this delightful &#8747;cenery, afford the mo&#8747;t refre&#8747;hing refuge from noon-tide heat.</p>
<p>Such were the &#8747;cenes the poet panted after, when they drew from his &#8747;oul, oppre&#8747;&#8747;ed by the languor of a &#8747;ummer-&#8747;un, that ardent a&#8747;piration;</p>

<p><i>Dat &#8747;onitum</i>, &#8747;ays this accurate ob&#8747;erver of nature; remarking in the expre&#8747;&#8747;ion, that the torrent was an addre&#8747;s to the ear, not to the eye.</p>
<p>The <i>contracted valley</i>, we have &#8747;een, may open to a <i>di&#8747;tance</i>; but a view into the <i>gill</i> furni&#8747;hes only a <i>fore-ground</i>.  It can only con&#8747;i&#8747;t of &#8747;ome little &#8747;eque&#8747;tered rece&#8747;s -- a few twi&#8747;ted boles -- a ca&#8747;cade &#8747;parkling through the trees -- or a tran&#8747;lucent pool, formed in the cavity beneath &#8747;ome rock, and ju&#8747;t large enough to reflect the hanging wood, which over &#8747;ha

dows it.  And yet even on this contracted &#8747;cale, we have many a beautiful land&#8747;cape:</p>

<head level="1" align="center">SECT. IX.</head>
<p>WE have now examined the materials, of which the magnificent &#8747;cenery of this country is compo&#8747;ed -- the <i>di&#8747;tant mountain</i> -- the <i>lake</i> -- and the <i>fore-ground:</i> but a few general ob&#8747;ervations on the&#8747;e materials, as <i>united in compo&#8747;ition</i>, may perhaps throw &#8747;ome new and picture&#8747;que lights on the whole.</p>
<p>In many countries much <i>grander</i> &#8747;cenes are exhibited, than the&#8747;e, -- mountains more magnificent, and lakes more exten&#8747;ive: yet, it is probable there are few, in which the &#8747;everal objects are better proportioned; and united with more beauty.</p>
<p>In America the lakes are &#8747;eas; and the country on their banks, being removed of cour&#8747;e to a great di&#8747;tance, can add no accompaniments.</p>
<pb n="118"/>
<p>Among the <i>&#8747;maller</i> lakes of Italy and Switzerland, no doubt, there are many delightful &#8747;cenes: but the <i>larger</i> lakes, like tho&#8747;e of America, are di&#8747;proportioned to their accompaniments: the water occupies too large a &#8747;pace, and throws the &#8747;cenery too much in di&#8747;tance.</p>
<p>The mountains of Sweden, Norway, and other northern regions, are probably rather ma&#8747;&#8747;es of hideous rudene&#8747;s, than &#8747;cenes of grandeur and proportion.  Proportion indeed in all &#8747;cenery is indi&#8747;pen&#8747;ably nece&#8747;&#8747;ary; and unle&#8747;s the lake, and it's corre&#8747;pondent mountains have this ju&#8747;t relation to each other, they want the fir&#8747;t principle of beauty.</p>
<p>The value of lake-&#8747;cenery ari&#8747;es rather from the idea of <i>magnificence</i>, than of <i>variety</i>.  The &#8747;cene is not continually &#8747;hifting here, as on the banks of a winding river.  The lake is &#8747;o va&#8747;t, that it &#8747;tands &#8747;till, as it were, before the moving eye.  Nor is this attended with &#8747;atiety.  A quick &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ion of imagery is nece&#8747;&#8747;ary in &#8747;cenes of le&#8747;s grandeur, where little beauties are ea&#8747;ily &#8747;canned: but &#8747;cenes, like the&#8747;e, demand contemplation.  The&#8747;e rich volumes of
<pb n="119"/>
nature, like the works of e&#8747;tabli&#8747;hed authors, will bear a frequent peru&#8747;al.  Contemplation adds to their value.</p>
<p>In the mean time, with all this magnificence and beauty, it cannot be &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed, that every &#8747;cene, which the&#8747;e countries pre&#8747;ent, is <i>correctly picture&#8747;que</i>.  In &#8747;uch immen&#8747;e bodies of rough-hewn matter, many irregularities, and even many deformities, mu&#8747;t exi&#8747;t, which a practi&#8747;ed eye would wi&#8747;h to correct.  Mountains are &#8747;ometimes crouded -- their &#8747;ides are often bare, when contra&#8747;t requires them to be wooded -- promontories form the water-boundary into acute angles -- and bays are contracted into narrow points, in&#8747;tead of &#8747;welling into ample ba&#8747;ons.</p>
<p>In all the&#8747;e ca&#8747;es the imagination is apt to whi&#8747;per, What glorious &#8747;cenes might here be made, if the&#8747;e &#8747;tubborn materials could yield to the judicious hand of art! -- And, to &#8747;ay the truth, we are &#8747;ometimes tempted to let the imagination loo&#8747;e among them.</p>
<p>By the force of this creative power an intervening hill may be turned a&#8747;ide; and a di&#8747;tance introduced. -- This ill-&#8747;haped moun-
<pb n="120"/>
tain may be pared, and formed into a better line. -- To that, on the oppo&#8747;ite &#8747;ide, a lightne&#8747;s may be given by the addition of a higher &#8747;ummit. -- Upon you bald declivity, which &#8747;tretches along the lake, may be reared a fore&#8747;t of noble oak; which thinly &#8747;catter'd over the top, will thicken as it de&#8747;cends; and throw it's vivid reflections on the water in full luxuriance.</p>
<p>The line of the water too, which perhaps is &#8747;traight, the imagination will ea&#8747;ily correct.  It will bring forward &#8747;ome bold promontory; or open &#8747;ome winding bay.</p>
<p>It will proceed even to the ornaments of art.  On &#8747;ome projecting knoll it will rear the maje&#8747;ty of a ruined ca&#8747;tle, who&#8747;e ivyed walls &#8747;eem a part of the very rock, on which they &#8747;tand.  On a gentle ri&#8747;e, opening to the lake, and half incircled by wood hills, &#8747;ome mouldring abbey may be &#8747;eated; and far beyond may appear di&#8747;tant objects, under &#8747;ome circum&#8747;tance of picture&#8747;que illumination:</p>
<poem>
	<line>The fore&#8747;t <i>darkening</i> round, and <i>glittering</i> &#8747;pire.</line>
</poem>
<p>Thus the imagination will a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;t tho&#8747;e &#8747;cenes, which, tho replete with beauties beyond it's power to create, may contain deformities,
<pb n="121"/>
which it might wi&#8747;h to remove.  It corrects one part of nature by another; and compo&#8747;es a land&#8747;cape, as the arti&#8747;t compo&#8747;ed his celebrated Venus, by &#8747;electing accordant beauties from different originals.  Scarce any <i>&#8747;ingle</i> archetype is &#8747;ufficiently correct.  Any other idea of <i>improving</i> nature is ab&#8747;urd; and can be adopted only by men of fal&#8747;e ta&#8747;te, who imagine they <i>improve</i> her by an addition of heterogeneous decorations.</p>
<p>As to the <i>improvement</i> of &#8747;uch <i>va&#8747;t &#8747;cenes</i> as the&#8747;e, it is in every &#8747;hape, except by a little planting, beyond all power of art.  I cannot therefore be under&#8747;tood to &#8747;ugge&#8747;t improvement here.  All we get by imagining, how &#8747;uch a country as this might be improved, is merely a little practice in the rules of picture&#8747;que compo&#8747;ition.</p>
<p>We may remark further, that the power which the imagination hath over the&#8747;e &#8747;cenes, is not greater, than the power, which they have over the imagination.  No tame country, however beautiful, however adorned, can di&#8747;tend the mind, like this awful, and maje&#8747;tic &#8747;cenery.  The wild &#8747;allies of untutored genius
<pb n="122"/>
often &#8747;trike the imagination more, than the mo&#8747;t correct effu&#8747;ions of cultivated parts.  Tho the <i>eye</i> therefore might take more plea&#8747;ure in a view (con&#8747;idered <i>merely in a picture&#8747;que light</i>) when a little adorned by the hand of art; yet I much doubt, whether &#8747;uch a view would have that &#8747;trong effect on the <i>imagination</i>; as when rough with all it's bold irregularities about it; when beauty, and deformity, grandeur and horror, mingled together, &#8747;trike the mind with a thou&#8747;and oppo&#8747;ing ideas; and like chymical infu&#8747;ions of an oppo&#8747;ite nature, produce an efferve&#8747;cence, which no harmonious mixtures could produce.</p>
<poem>
	<line>Surely there is a hidden power, that reigns</line>

</poem>
<p>Were a lover of nature placed <i>abruptly</i> in the mid&#8747;t of &#8747;uch &#8747;cenes as the&#8747;e, the effect might be too &#8747;trong: and this in&#8747;tance, as in others, he might di&#8747;cover the weakne&#8747;s of his fir&#8747;t progenitor; in whom, on viewing &#8747;uddenly a grand land&#8747;cape, we are told,</p>
<poem>

	<line>Sank down, and all his &#8747;pirits became intranced.</line>
</poem>
<p>But nature, which brings out the &#8747;un through the medium of twilight, hath in this ca&#8747;e al&#8747;o provided for the weakne&#8747;s of the vi&#8747;ual nerve.  The&#8747;e grand &#8747;cenes are <i>gradually</i> introduced.  The idea grows imperceptibly to maturity.  The great &#8747;tones of ye&#8747;terday become rocks to-day.  Hills, in a few &#8747;tages, are converted into mountains; and we &#8747;ee, now and then, the glimp&#8747;e of a lake; before the eye is filled with the whole va&#8747;t, &#8747;plendid &#8747;urface of it.</p>
<p>If the imagination be thus fired by the&#8747;e romantic &#8747;cenes even in their <i>common</i> &#8747;tate, how much more may we &#8747;uppo&#8747;e it wrought on, when they &#8747;trike us under &#8747;ome <i>extraordinary</i> circum&#8747;tance of beauty, or terror -- in the tranquility of a calm, or the agitation of a &#8747;torm?</p>
<p>Some &#8747;cenes, particularly of the &#8747;ylvan kind, are perhaps be&#8747;t &#8747;uited to a calm.  They receive their principal beauty from the <i>richne&#8747;s</i> of the objects; which is improved by chearful and &#8747;plendid lights.</p>
<p>Other &#8747;cenes, le&#8747;s inriched by objects, are meagre in a calm, and glaring &#8747;un&#8747;hine.  A
<pb n="124"/>
bright hemi&#8747;phere only renders their poverty more apparent.  To &#8747;uch &#8747;cenes a &#8747;torm, which produces &#8747;ublime ideas by heaving clouds, and bur&#8747;ting lights, gives an adventitious con&#8747;equence, and leads the eye, in it's pur&#8747;uit of <i>objects</i>, to the <i>grandeur of the effect</i>.</p>
<p>But there are &#8747;ome &#8747;cenes in nature, which are adapted to both circum&#8747;tances -- none more, than the &#8747;cenery of lakes -- none perhaps &#8747;o much.</p>
<p>During five days, which we &#8747;pent among the lakes, we &#8747;aw one of them only, and that but once, under the circum&#8747;tance of a <i>perfect</i> calm -- when there was neither wind to ruffle, nor cloud to ob&#8747;cure, the re&#8747;plendency of the &#8747;urface -- when we &#8747;aw the poet's de&#8747;cription literally tran&#8747;lated --</p>

<p>When we take a view of &#8747;uch a glorious &#8747;cene in all it's &#8747;plendor, we regret, that it &#8747;hould ever be deformed by the rough bla&#8747;ts of <i>tempe&#8747;t:</i> and yet I know not, whether, under this latter circum&#8747;tance, it may not have a &#8747;till greater <i>power over the imagination</i>.  Every little idea is lo&#8747;t in the wild uproar and confu&#8747;ion of &#8747;uch a &#8747;cene.</p>
<p>Nor is it in this di&#8747;turbed &#8747;tate, le&#8747;s an <i>object of picture&#8747;que beauty</i>.  The &#8747;ky floating with broken clouds -- the mountains half ob&#8747;cured by driving vapours; and mingling with the &#8747;ky in awful ob&#8747;curity -- the trees &#8747;training in the bla&#8747;t -- and the lake &#8747;tirred from the bottom, and whitening every rocky promontory with it's foam; are all objects highly adapted to the pencil.</p>
<p>In the mid&#8747;t of the tempe&#8747;t, if a bright &#8747;unbeam &#8747;hould &#8747;uddenly break out; and in Shake&#8747;pear's language, <i>light up the &#8747;torm</i>, the &#8747;cenery of an agitated lake, thus a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;ted by the powers of contra&#8747;t, affects both the <i>imagination</i>, and
<pb n="127"/>
the <i>eye</i>, in a &#8747;till greater degree.  Some broad mountain-&#8747;ide, catching a ma&#8747;s of light, produces an a&#8747;toni&#8747;hing effect amid&#8747;t the leaden gloom, which &#8747;urrounds it.  Perhaps a &#8747;unbeam, half-&#8747;uffu&#8747;ed in vapour, darting between two mountains, may &#8747;tretch along the water in a lengthened gleam, ju&#8747;t as the &#8747;kiff pa&#8747;&#8747;es to receive the light upon it's &#8747;welling &#8747;ail: while the &#8747;ea-gull, wheeling along the &#8747;torm, turns it's &#8747;ilvery &#8747;ide, &#8747;trongly illumined, again&#8747;t the bo&#8747;om of &#8747;ome lurid cloud; and by that &#8747;ingle touch of oppo&#8747;ition, gives double darkne&#8747;s to the ri&#8747;ing tempe&#8747;t.</p>
<p>Compared with &#8747;uch &#8747;cenes, how inanimate do the &#8747;ubjects of Canaletti appear! -- how flat his &#8747;quare canals, and formal &#8747;treet-per&#8747;pective; when oppo&#8747;ed to &#8747;preading lakes, and &#8747;weeping mountains! -- the puny labours of men, to the bold, irregular &#8747;cenery of nature!  Nor can we help regretting the lo&#8747;s of &#8747;uch pictures as might have been produced, if Canaletti's free pencil had been thrown loo&#8747;e in &#8747;uch a country as this.</p>
<p>But the&#8747;e &#8747;cenes are not only &#8747;uperior to the &#8747;ubjects of Canaletti; but to tho&#8747;e of a greater

ma&#8747;ter, the younger Vanderveld.  Sea-views, tho grander in &#8747;ome re&#8747;pects, are, on the hole, inferior to the views before us.  Their great deficiency is the want of a variety in their accompaniments.  One &#8747;pecies of them indeed, and but one, is &#8747;uperior to the utmo&#8747;t efforts of the lake -- the &#8747;egment of &#8747;ome land-locked bay; which, in a &#8747;torm e&#8747;pecially, is a noble &#8747;ubject: the waters are more agitated, and form bolder &#8747;wells; which, of cour&#8747;e, receive grander effects of light.  Here too, in&#8747;tead of the dancing &#8747;kiff, we are pre&#8747;ented with the terrors of &#8747;hipwreck.  The beacon al&#8747;o, &#8747;eated on a bleak eminence, marks the coa&#8747;t with peculiar danger; while the di&#8747;tant port-town, di&#8747;covered by a gleam of light under the &#8747;hadowing cliff, makes the &#8747;cene &#8747;till more affecting by the exclu&#8747;ion of hope within &#8747;ight of &#8747;ecurity.</p>
<p>I have only farther to ob&#8747;erve, in <i>general</i>, on the &#8747;cenes of this romantic country, that they are &#8747;ubject to violent convul&#8747;ions of various kinds.  Every thing, here, is in the grand &#8747;tyle.  The very elements, when they do mi&#8747;

chief, keep in uni&#8747;on with it, and perform all their operations with an air of dignity.</p>
<p>Upon &#8747;ome of the mountains, particularly on Cro&#8747;s-fell, a bla&#8747;t, called in the country, a <i>helm-wind</i>, will &#8747;ometimes ari&#8747;e &#8747;uddenly, of a nature &#8747;o violent, that nothing can with&#8747;tand it's force.  The experienced mountaineer, as he traver&#8747;es tho&#8747;e wild regions, fore&#8747;eeing it's approach, throws him&#8747;elf flat upon the ground; and lets it pa&#8747;s over him.  It's rage is momentary: and the air in&#8747;tantly &#8747;ettles into it's former calm.</p>
<p>The&#8747;e hurricanes are not uncommon in other mountainous countries.  Mr. Misson particularly &#8747;peaking of the mountains near In&#8747;pruck, tells us, that the winds often force their way through their hollow parts, as if through pipes, and rai&#8747;e &#8747;uch furious hurricanes, as will &#8747;ometimes root up, not only trees; but even rocks.</p>
<p>The lake too is &#8747;ubject to &#8747;omething of the &#8747;ame kind of emotion; which the inhabitants of the country call a <i>bottom-wind</i>.  Often,
<pb n="130"/>
when all is calm, and re&#8747;plendent around; as the boat is plying it's &#8747;teady way; the boatman will de&#8747;cry at a di&#8747;tance (happy that it is &#8747;o) a violent ebullition of the water.  He will &#8747;ee it heave and &#8747;well; forced upwards by &#8747;ome internal convul&#8747;ion; and &#8747;uffering all the agitation of a &#8747;torm.  But as &#8747;oon as the confined air has &#8747;pent it's force, the agitated &#8747;urface immediately &#8747;ub&#8747;ides.</p>
<p>Of the&#8747;e <i>bottom-winds</i> al&#8747;o we meet with frequent accounts: particularly in &#8747;ome of the Sweedi&#8747;h lakes, which are very &#8747;ubject to them.</p>
<p>Something of this kind, &#8747;eems to have given Spencer an idea, which he introduces in his <i>idle lake:</i></p>
<poem>
	<line>The waves come rolling, and the billows roar,</line>
	<line>Outrageou&#8747;ly as they engaged were:</line>
	<line>But not one puff of wind there did appear.</line>
</poem>
<p>Often al&#8747;o a va&#8747;t body of water, collected in the entrails of a mountain, it is &#8747;aid, will force a way through it's &#8747;ide; and ru&#8747;hing down the declivity, take it's cour&#8747;e through the valley; where it is not uncommon to &#8747;ee the marks of it's deva&#8747;tation.</p>
<pb n="131"/>
<p>The &#8747;ame effects are &#8747;ometimes produced by <i>water-&#8747;pouts</i>, which in countries like the&#8747;e, are collected, as at &#8747;ea, and fall upon mountains.</p>
<p>The <i>avalanche</i>, or fall of &#8747;now, is common here too, as in other mountainous countries.  Inundations al&#8747;o are occa&#8747;ioned by it's &#8747;udden melting.</p>
<p>But the fall of cliffs, and large fragments of mountains, loo&#8747;ened by rain, and fro&#8747;t, produces one of the greate&#8747;t &#8747;cenes of terror, which belongs to this romantic country; and to which we are chiefly indebted for that variety of fractured rock, and broken ground, which are among it's greate&#8747;t ornaments.  Virgil has given us a de&#8747;cription of this kind in great perfection.</p>

<p>AMBLESIDE is an ordinary village; but delightfully &#8747;eated.  A cove of lofty mountains half incircles it on the north; and the lake of Wynander opens in front; near the &#8747;hores of which it &#8747;tands.</p>
<p>The ground between it and the mountains, which are at lea&#8747;t two miles di&#8747;tant, is various, broken, and woody.  A mountain-torrent, about half a mile from the village, forms a grand ca&#8747;cade; but it was &#8747;o overgrown with thickets, that we had no point of view to &#8747;ee it from, but the top; which is the mo&#8747;t unpicture&#8747;que we could have.</p>
<p>From this fall the &#8747;tream ru&#8747;hes along a narrow valley, or <i>gill</i>, luxuriantly adorned with rock, and wood: and winding through it about a mile, emerges near the head of the lake, into which it enters.  This <i>gill</i> was
<pb n="134"/>
&#8747;o overgrown with wood, that it appeared almo&#8747;t impervious: but if a path could be carried through it, and the whole a little opened, it might be made very beautiful.  A &#8747;cene in it&#8747;elf &#8747;o plea&#8747;ing, with a noble ca&#8747;cade at one end, and an exten&#8747;ive lake at the other, could not fail, to &#8747;trike the imagination in the mo&#8747;t forcible manner.</p>
<p>From Amble&#8747;ide we &#8747;et out for Bowne&#8747;s, to take a view of the lake.  Part of the road we had traver&#8747;ed, the day before, from Kendal; and were a &#8747;econd time amu&#8747;ed by the woody land&#8747;cape it afforded; and it's &#8747;udden, interrupted openings to the lake, before the whole bur&#8747;t of that magnificent &#8747;cene was pre&#8747;ented. -- From the higher grounds, above Bowne&#8747;s, we had an elevated view of its whole extent.</p>
<p>Windermere, or Winander-water, as it is &#8747;ometimes called, extends from north to &#8747;outh, about twelve or fourteen miles.  In breadth, it rarely exceeds two; and is &#8747;eldom narrower than one.  The &#8747;outhern end winds a little towards the we&#8747;t.  The northern, and we&#8747;tern coa&#8747;ts are wild, and mountainous -- the ea&#8747;tern, and &#8747;outhern are more depre&#8747;&#8747;ed; in

&#8747;ome parts cultivated, in others woody.  Oppo&#8747;ite to Bowne&#8747;s, the lake is divided into two parts by a clu&#8747;ter of i&#8747;lands; one of which is larger than the re&#8747;t.</p>
<p>Bowne&#8747;s is the capital port-town on the lake; if we may adopt a dignified &#8747;tyle, which the grandeur of the country naturally &#8747;ugge&#8747;ts.  It is the great mart for fi&#8747;h, and charcoal; both which commodities are largely imported here; and carried by land into the country.  It's harbour is crouded with ve&#8747;&#8747;els of various kinds; &#8747;ome of which are u&#8747;ed merely as plea&#8747;ure-boats in navigating the lake. -- In one of the&#8747;e we embarked, and &#8747;tanding out to &#8747;ea; made for the great i&#8747;land; which we were informed was a very intere&#8747;ting &#8747;cene.</p>
<p>We &#8747;oon arrived at it; and landing at the &#8747;outh end, we ordered our boat to meet us at the north point; meaning to traver&#8747;e it's little boundaries.</p>
<p>A more &#8747;eque&#8747;tered &#8747;pot cannot ea&#8747;ily be conceived.  Nothing can be more excluded from the noi&#8747;e, and interruption of life; or abound with a greater variety of tho&#8747;e circum&#8747;tances, which make retirement plea&#8747;ing.</p>
<p>The whole i&#8747;land contains about thirty acres.  It's form is oblong: it's &#8747;hores irregular; retiring into bays, and broken into creeks.
<pb n="135.1"/>
<gap desc="unclear landscape orientated oval picture"/>
<pb n="136"/>
The &#8747;urface too is uneven; and a &#8747;ort of little Appennine ridge runs through the middle of it; falling down, in all &#8747;hapes, into the water.  -- Like it's great mother-i&#8747;land, the &#8747;outhern part wears a &#8747;moother a&#8747;pect, than the northern, which is broken, and rocky.</p>
<p>Formerly the whole i&#8747;land was one entire grove.  At pre&#8747;ent, it is rather bare of wood; tho there are &#8747;ome large oaks upon it.</p>
<p>One of it's greate&#8747;t beauties ari&#8747;es from that irregular little Appennine, ju&#8747;t mentioned, which extends from one end to the other.  This circum&#8747;tance hides it's <i>in&#8747;ularity</i>, by connecting it with the continent.  In every part, except on the high grounds, you &#8747;tand in an amphitheatre compo&#8747;ed of the noble&#8747;t objects; and the lake performing the office of a &#8747;unk fence, the grandeur of each part of the continent is called in, by turns, to aid the in&#8747;ignificance of the i&#8747;land.</p>
<p>The oblong form al&#8747;o of the lake gives the i&#8747;land another great advantage.  On both it's <i>&#8747;ides</i>, the oppo&#8747;ite &#8747;hores of the continent are little more than half a mile di&#8747;tant: but at the northern and &#8747;outhern <i>points</i> there is a large &#8747;heet of water.  The views therefore, as you walk round, are continually changing
<pb n="137"/>
through all the varieties of <i>di&#8747;tances</i>; which are &#8747;till farther improved by a little degree of obliquity, in the po&#8747;ition of the i&#8747;land.</p>
<p>He who &#8747;hould take upon him to ornament &#8747;uch a &#8747;cene as this, would have only to conduct his walk and plantations, &#8747;o as to take advantage of the grand parts of the continent around him; -- to hide what is offen&#8747;ive -- and, amid&#8747;t a choice of great and picture&#8747;que &#8747;cenes, to avoid &#8747;hewing too much.  As he would have, at all times, an exuberance of water, he &#8747;hould not be o&#8747;tentatious in di&#8747;playing it.  It would be a relief to the eye &#8747;ometimes to exclude it wholly; and to introduce a mere &#8747;ylvan &#8747;cene, with di&#8747;tant mountains ri&#8747;ing above it.  A tran&#8747;ient glance of the water, with &#8747;ome well-cho&#8747;en objects beyond it, would often al&#8747;o have a good effect; and &#8747;ometimes a grand expan&#8747;ion of the whole. -- Thus the objects around, tho unmanageable in them&#8747;elves, might be brought under command by the a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;tance of an in&#8747;ular &#8747;ituation.</p>
<p>With regard to the <i>ornamenting</i> of &#8747;uch a &#8747;cene, an elegant <i>neatne&#8747;s</i> is all the improver
<pb n="138"/>
&#8747;hould aim at.  Amid&#8747;t the&#8747;e grand objects of nature, it would be ab&#8747;urd to catch the eye with the <i>affected</i> decorations of art.  The &#8747;imple idea he would de&#8747;ire to pre&#8747;erve, is, what the place it&#8747;elf &#8747;ugge&#8747;ts, a &#8747;eque&#8747;tered retreat.  The <i>boundaries</i> &#8747;hould in a great mea&#8747;ure be thicket -- on the ea&#8747;tern coa&#8747;t e&#8747;pecially, which is oppo&#8747;ed to the only cultivated part of the country: and if there be any thing in that part worth giving to the eye, it might be given through &#8747;ome <i>unaffected</i> opening.</p>
<p>For thickets, the wild wood of the country would abundantly &#8747;uffice.  It grows luxuriantly, and would &#8747;oon produce it's effect.</p>
<p>The middle parts of the i&#8747;land, with a few clumps properly di&#8747;po&#8747;ed, might be neat pa&#8747;turage, with flocks, and herds; which would contra&#8747;t agreeably with the rough &#8747;cenery around.</p>
<p>The hou&#8747;e, at pre&#8747;ent, &#8747;tands too formally in the middle of the i&#8747;land.  It might &#8747;tand better near the &#8747;outhern promontory.  The air of this &#8747;weet retreat is &#8747;aid to be very pure.<ptr target="n3"/></p>
<note id="n3">Since this view of Windermere i&#8747;land was taken, it hath been under the hands of improvement.  The proprietor, I have been told, &#8747;pent &#8747;ix thou&#8747;and pounds upon it; with which &#8747;um he has contrived to do almo&#8747;t every thing, that one would wi&#8747;h had been left undone.

<p>This i&#8747;land belonged formerly to the Philip&#8747;ons, a family of note in We&#8747;tmoreland.  During the civil wars, two of them, an elder, and a younger brother, &#8747;erved the king.  The former, who was the proprietor of it, commanded a regiment: the latter was a major.</p>
<p>The major, who&#8747;e name was Robert, was a man of great &#8747;pirit, and enterprize; and for his many feats of per&#8747;onal bravery, had obtained, among the Oliverians of tho&#8747;e parts, the appellation of <i>Robin the Devil</i>.</p>
<p>After the war &#8747;ub&#8747;ided, Col. Briggs, a &#8747;teady friend to the u&#8747;urpation, re&#8747;iding at Kendal, under the double character of a leading magi&#8747;trate (for he was a ju&#8747;tice of the peace) and an active commander, held the country in awe.  This per&#8747;on having heard, that Major Philp&#8747;on was at his brother's hou&#8747;e on the i&#8747;land in Windermere, re&#8747;olved, if po&#8747;&#8747;ible, to &#8747;eize, and puni&#8747;h a man, who
<pb n="140"/>
had made him&#8747;elf &#8747;o particularly obnoxious.  With this view he mu&#8747;tered a party, which he thought &#8747;ufficient; and went him&#8747;elf on the enterprize.  How it was conducted, my authority<ptr target="n4"/> does not inform us -- whether he got together the navigation of the lake, and blockaded the place by &#8747;ea; or whether, he landed, and carried on his approaches in form.  Neither do we learn the &#8747;trength of the garri&#8747;on within; nor of the works without: thos every gentleman's hou&#8747;e was, at that time, in &#8747;ome degree a fortre&#8747;s.  All we learn, is, that Major Philp&#8747;on endured a &#8747;eige of eight, or ten days with great gallantry; till his brother, the colonel, hearing of his di&#8747;tre&#8747;s, rai&#8747;ed a party, and relieved him.</p>
<note id="n4">Dr Bourn's hi&#8747;. of We&#8747;tmoreland.</note>
<p>It was now the major's turn to make reprizals.  He put him&#8747;elf therefore at the head of a little troop of hor&#8747;e, and rode to Kendal, where Col. Briggs re&#8747;ided.  Here being informed, that the colonel was at prayers, (for it was on a &#8747;unday morning) he &#8747;tationed his men properly in the avenues; and him&#8747;elf, armed, roder directly into the church.  It is
<pb n="141"/>
&#8747;aid, he intended to &#8747;eize the colonel, and carry him off: but as this &#8747;eems to have been totally impracticable, it is rather probably, that his intention was to kill him on the &#8747;pot; and in the mid&#8747;t of the confu&#8747;ion, to e&#8747;cape.  Whatever his intention was, it was fru&#8747;trated; for Briggs happened to be el&#8747;ewhere.</p>
<p>The congregation, as might be expected, was thrown into great confu&#8747;ion on &#8747;eeing an armed man, on hor&#8747;eback, enter the church; and the major taking the advantage of their a&#8747;toni&#8747;hment, turned his hor&#8747;e round, and rode quietly out.  But having given an alarm, he was pre&#8747;ently a&#8747;&#8747;aulted as he left the church: and being &#8747;eized; his girths were cut; and he was unhor&#8747;ed.</p>
<p>At this in&#8747;tant, his party made a furious attack on the a&#8747;&#8747;ailants; and the major, killing with his own hand, the man, who had &#8747;eized him, clapped the &#8747;addle, ungirthed as it was, upon his hor&#8747;e; and vaulting into it, rode full &#8747;peed through the &#8747;treets of Kendal, calling to his men to follow him; and with his whole party made a &#8747;afe retreat to his a&#8747;ylum in the lake. -- The action marked the man.  Many knew him; and they who did not, knew as well from the exploit, that it
<pb n="142"/>
could be nobody, but <i>Robin the Devil</i>. -- Such are the calamities of civil war!  After the direful effects of public oppo&#8747;ition cea&#8747;e; revenge, and private malice long keep alive the animo&#8747;ity of individuals.</p>

<p>HAVING thus taken a view of a place abounding with &#8747;o many beauties, we found our bark waiting for us at the northern point; and &#8747;etting &#8747;ail, in&#8747;tead of returning to Bowne&#8747;s, we &#8747;tood for Amble&#8747;ide.

<p>As we left the i&#8747;land, the &#8747;cene opening on every &#8747;ide, we found our&#8747;elves &#8747;urrounded with objects of great magnificence.</p>
<p>On the we&#8747;tern coa&#8747;t ran a continuous range of craggy mountains, thinly &#8747;cattered over with trees, which had formerly over&#8747;pread it.  It is a part of Furne&#8747;s-fell; the whole of which
<pb n="144"/>
we had before &#8747;een, in one va&#8747;t combination of di&#8747;tant mountains, bounding our view over the bay of Cartmel.  The part we now &#8747;aw &#8747;tretches about two leagues along the lake.</p>
<p>On the ea&#8747;tern &#8747;ide, we pa&#8747;&#8747;ed &#8747;everal &#8747;mall i&#8747;lands, &#8747;ome of which were well-wooded; others were mere rocks with low, twi&#8747;ted trees bur&#8747;ting from their crevices; all of them probably worth vi&#8747;iting, if our time had allowed.  Through the openings of the&#8747;e i&#8747;lands, we had partial views of the ea&#8747;tern coa&#8747;t; till having advanced further through this little archipelago into the body of the lake, the whole ea&#8747;tern &#8747;kreen opened to the eye -- This &#8747;ide, tho le&#8747;s magnificent than the mountains of Furne&#8747;s on the left, contains however more variety.  It is broken into hills; &#8747;ome of which are cultivated, and others covered with wood.</p>
<p>But, on the whole, neither of the&#8747;e &#8747;ide-&#8747;creens is an object purely <i>picture&#8747;que</i>.  The we&#8747;tern &#8747;hore is great indeed; but it is an unvaried ma&#8747;s of heavy greatne&#8747;s.  The ea&#8747;tern is broken too much, and wants both unity and grandeur.  When we rode through it in the morning, it made an admirable <i>fore-ground</i> in almo&#8747;t every part: but we now found it le&#8747;s qualified as a <i>di&#8747;tance</i>.</p>
<pb n="145"/>
<p>The &#8747;ide-&#8747;creens however are the lea&#8747;t e&#8747;&#8747;ential parts of this va&#8747;t &#8747;cene.  The front is the capital part -- that part, on which the eye immediately &#8747;ettles.  It con&#8747;i&#8747;ts of that immen&#8747;e body of barrier mountains, which &#8747;eparate the two counties of Cumberland and We&#8747;tmoreland; appearing in this view to be drawn up in a &#8747;ort of tumultuary array, mountain beyond mountain, as far as the eye could reach.</p>
<p>As we advanced in our voyage, this great divi&#8747;ion of the lake (from the i&#8747;lands to it's northern point,) tho really oblong, a&#8747;&#8747;umed the form of a va&#8747;t circular ba&#8747;on: and the rough mountains, ari&#8747;ing round it, appeared, from &#8747;o &#8747;plended an area, with new grandeur.  Indeed contra&#8747;t gave an additional force to the character of each.</p>
<p>This great &#8747;cene however, &#8747;urveyed thus from a centre, was rather amu&#8747;ing, than picture&#8747;que.  It was too exten&#8747;ive for the painter's u&#8747;e.  A &#8747;mall portion of the circle, reduced to paper, or canvas, could have conveyed no idea; and a large &#8747;egment would have exceeded all the powers of the pallet.</p>
<pb n="146"/>
<p>It is certainly an error in land&#8747;cape-painting, to comprehend too much.  It turns a picture into a map.  Nothing is more delu&#8747;ive, than to &#8747;uppo&#8747;e, that every view, which plea&#8747;es in nature, will plea&#8747;e in painting.  In nature, the plea&#8747;ure ari&#8747;es from the eye's roaming from one pa&#8747;&#8747;age to another; and making it's remarks on each.  In painting, (as the eye is there confined within certain limits,) it ari&#8747;es from &#8747;eeing &#8747;ome &#8747;elect &#8747;pot adorned agreeably to the rules of art.  And the painter, who wi&#8747;hes to make a plea&#8747;ing compo&#8747;ition, mu&#8747;t not include more than he can thus adorn.  His fore-ground, and his di&#8747;tance mu&#8747;t bear a proportion to each other; which cannot be the ca&#8747;e, if he include a va&#8747;t compa&#8747;s.  For as he can only take in a <i>certain</i> quantity of fore-ground; the removed parts of his picture &#8747;hould bear a proper proportion to it.  Well-managed exceptions may be found: yet &#8747;till, in general, the rule is good.</p>
<p>But altho the whole of the amphitheatre we are now &#8747;urveying, was, in it's full dimen&#8747;ions, no &#8747;ubject for a picture; yet it exhibited many parts which, as di&#8747;tances, were purely picture&#8747;que; and afforded an admirable collection of mountain &#8747;tudies for a painter.  I &#8747;peak
<pb n="147"/>
particularly of the front &#8747;kreen, in which the lines of the mountains were beautiful, and various -- the inter&#8747;ections al&#8747;o of tho&#8747;e lines -- the promontories; with the deep &#8747;hades they projected -- and above all, the mountain colouring, which was the mo&#8747;t &#8747;plendid we had ever &#8747;een.  Airy tints of vivid yellow, green, and purple, we could pri&#8747;matically &#8747;eparate.  Bright &#8747;pots of effulgence al&#8747;o appeared; which could not well be denominated of any colour.  Yet all, tho di&#8747;played in &#8747;uch rich profu&#8747;ion, were blended with &#8747;uch nice harmony; and tempered &#8747;o mode&#8747;tly by the grey mi&#8747;tine&#8747;s of di&#8747;tance; that gorgeous as the&#8747;e hues were, there was not a &#8747;ingle colour, that glared, or was out of place.</p>

<p>We had now made a con&#8747;iderable progre&#8747;s in our voyage.  The &#8747;ide-&#8747;creen on the left, kept &#8747;till the &#8747;ame di&#8747;tance; but the mountains in front, as we approached them, began now to &#8747;eparate into near, and di&#8747;tant grounds: 
<pb n="148"/>
and the rocks and woods, which, in the painter's language, <i>adhered</i> before; now <i>broke away</i> in a variety of projections; tho &#8747;till o'er&#8747;pread with &#8747;oft colouring, and tender &#8747;hadow.</p>
<p>As we approached nearer, this &#8747;oftne&#8747;s of colouring took a more vivid hue; and the promontories, and rocks continued &#8747;till projecting to the eye with new force of &#8747;hade: while the mountains, which ranged behind, began more and more to retire.  The length of the lake, tho it affected the nearer grounds, made no change in the di&#8747;tant mountains: &#8747;o that the comparative di&#8747;tance between the fore-ground and them, was now much greater, than it had been.</p>
<p>An appearance of this kind is beautifully de&#8747;cribed by Virgil.  When &#198;neas came in &#8747;ight of Italy, he fir&#8747;t &#8747;aw a hazy appearance of hills, and low land;</p>

high ground, &#8747;eemed, as if it &#8747;tood on a promontory hanging over the &#8747;ea.</p>
<poem>
	<line> ----Templum apparet in arce Minerv&#230;</line>

<p>But as he came clo&#8747;e in with the land, the rocks took their proper form; and the temple retreated to a di&#8747;tance.</p>

	<line> ---- Gemino demittunt brachia muro</line>
	<line>Turriti &#8747;copuli; re&#8747;ugitque a litore templum.</line>
</poem>
<p>As we approached the end of the lake, the promontories and rocks a&#8747;&#8747;umed new height; and almo&#8747;t hid the mountains, which continued to retire beyond them; while the form of the nearer grounds began al&#8747;o to vary.  The water, which, a little before, &#8747;eemed in contact with the rocks, appeared now to wa&#8747;h a meadow; beyond which the rocks formed a fir&#8747;t di&#8747;tance.</p>
<p>The &#8747;cenery put us in mind of Berghem; who often cho&#8747;e a meadow, with a rock behind it, to relieve his cattle.  His rock is generally left plain, and &#8747;imple, almo&#8747;t without a &#8747;ingle varying tint; a mere ma&#8747;s of tender &#8747;hadow: while the cattle are touched with infinite force and &#8747;pirit.  We &#8747;aw the picture realized.  Berghem's imagination could not
<pb n="150"/>
have formed a better back-ground, nor a more beautiful group.  Such combinations are plea&#8747;ing in life, in painting, and in poetry.</p>

<p>Through the meadow at the bottom of the rocky ground, two rivers, the Bratha, and the Rotha, wind their way; and uniting before they meet the lake, enter it with a full, but quiet &#8747;tream; and furni&#8747;h it with large &#8747;upplies.</p>
<p>The Rotha takes it's ri&#8747;e from mountains about twelve miles di&#8747;tant; and forms the two lakes of Gra&#8747;mer, and Rydal, before it enter Windermere.</p>
<p>The Bratha ri&#8747;es from the pike of Langdale, in a mountainous, and rocky country; and
<pb n="151"/>
after a turbulent cour&#8747;e, buries at length all it's inquietude in the peaceful waters of the lake, where it's name is no more remembred.</p>
<p>Our boatmen having conveyed us a con&#8747;iderable way up the&#8747;e united &#8747;treams, landed us on the meadows, within half a mile of Amble&#8747;ide.</p>
<p>Before we leave this grand expan&#8747;e of water, I cannot forbear remarking a few circum&#8747;tances, that relate to it.</p>
<p>In the fir&#8747;t place we admired it's extraordinary brightne&#8747;s.  It is all over <i>nitidis argenteus undis</i>.  The eye can &#8747;ee di&#8747;tinctly, in &#8747;mooth water, through a medium of at lea&#8747;t a dozen yards; and view the inhabitants of it's deep rece&#8747;&#8747;es, as they play in &#8747;hoals, and</p>

</poem>
<p>How far the tran&#8747;parency of water is an addition to <i>a scene</i>, I cannot take upon me to &#8747;ay.  Mo&#8747;t of the lakes in Scotland, which I &#8747;aw, are of a mo&#8747;&#8747;y-tinctured hue; and yet had their full effect in land&#8747;cape. -- As a <i>detached object</i> however the tran&#8747;parent lake is
<pb n="152"/>
incomparably the mo&#8747;t beautiful.  I &#8747;hould &#8747;uppo&#8747;e al&#8747;o, that the more brilliant the water is, the more brilliant are the reflections.</p>
<p>Among the great variety of fi&#8747;h, which inhabit the exten&#8747;ive waters of this lake, the <i>char</i> is the mo&#8747;t remarkable.  It is near twice the &#8747;ize of a herring.  It's back is of an olive-green: it's belly of a light vermilion; &#8747;oftening in &#8747;ome parts into white; and changing into a deep red, at the in&#8747;ertion of the fins.</p> 
<p>A parcel of char, ju&#8747;t caught and thrown together into the luggage-pool of a boar, makes a plea&#8747;ant harmony of colouring.  The green olive-tint prevails; to which a &#8747;pirit is here and there given by a light blu&#8747;h of vermilion; and by a &#8747;trong touch of red, if a fin happen to appear.  The&#8747;e plea&#8747;ing colours are a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;ted by the bright &#8747;ilvery lights, which play over the whole; for nothing reflects light more beautifully than the &#8747;cales of fi&#8747;h.</p>
<p>Char are caught only in the winter-&#8747;ea&#8747;on, when twenty dozen in a day, are &#8747;ometimes taken by a &#8747;ingle boat.  In &#8747;ummer they retire to the rocky caves below, &#8747;ome of which are &#8747;aid to be unfathomable: nor do they breed
<pb n="153"/>
in any lake, in which &#8747;uch deep rece&#8747;&#8747;es are not found.</p>
<p>The char-fi&#8747;hing is a very profitable branch of trade to the proprietors of the lake.  The whole area of it is divided into five di&#8747;tricts.  An invi&#8747;ible line cro&#8747;&#8747;es the &#8747;urface from crag to crag -- a limit, which the fi&#8747;herman correctly knows.  But tho the &#8747;pace of each fi&#8747;hery is nearly equal, yet the produce is otherwi&#8747;e; the fi&#8747;h running in &#8747;hoals &#8747;ometimes in one part of the lake, and &#8747;ometimes in another. -- When the farmer rents land, he can judge of his bargain by the &#8747;urface.  When he rents water, he mu&#8747;t take his chance.</p>
<p>But fi&#8747;h are not the only inhabitants of this lake.  Innumerable flights of water-fowl frequent it's exten&#8747;ive plain.  The naturali&#8747;t may declare their names, and cla&#8747;&#8747;es: the painter has only to remark the variety of forms, in which they appear -- &#8747;ometimes &#8747;itting in black groups upon the water, ri&#8747;ing and &#8747;inking with the waves: at other times in the air, circling the lake in figured files; or with he&#8747;itating wing &#8747;eizing &#8747;ome &#8747;tation on it's banks, or &#8747;urface. -- With regard to the&#8747;e minute ap-
<pb n="154"/>
pendages of land&#8747;cape, let me only &#8747;ugge&#8747;t, that birds &#8747;hould never be introduced upon the wing, near the eye.  Quick motion, of any kind, <i>repre&#8747;ented</i>, is an ab&#8747;urdity: and the longer you look, the more ab&#8747;urd it becomes.  But at a little <i>di&#8747;tance</i> the motion of a bird appears &#8747;o &#8747;low, that the eye will <i>endure</i> a degree of improbability in the repre&#8747;entation of it.</p>
<p>I have only to add, that this magnificent piece of water &#8747;uffers little change, in <i>appearance</i>, from &#8747;ea&#8747;ons; but pre&#8747;erves the dignity of it's character under all circum&#8747;tances; &#8747;eldom depre&#8747;&#8747;ed, and as &#8747;eldom rai&#8747;ed above it's ordinary level -- Even in the mo&#8747;t violent rains, when the country is drenched in water, the mountains pour down floods through new channels; the lake maintains the &#8747;ame equal temper; and tho it may &#8747;pread a few yards over it's lowe&#8747;t &#8747;hores (which is the utmo&#8747;t it does) yet it's increa&#8747;e is &#8747;eldom the object of ob&#8747;ervation: nor does the &#8747;everity of the greate&#8747;t drought make any con&#8747;iderable alternation in it's bounds.  Once, (it is recorded,)
<pb n="155"/>
it ro&#8747;e &#8747;even feet in perpendicular height.  It's boundaries would then certainly <i>appear</i> inlarged; but this was a very uncommon ca&#8747;e.</p>
<p>But if it be not rai&#8747;ed by rains, it is often greatly agitated by winds.  Of all the lakes of this country, none lies &#8747;o expo&#8747;ed, through the whole length of it, to &#8747;udden &#8747;qualls, as this: nor does any piece of fre&#8747;h water in the whole i&#8747;land perhaps emulate the grandeur of a di&#8747;turbed ocean &#8747;o much.  It is of cour&#8747;e navigated with great caution, whenever there is a tendency to &#8747;tormy weather.  Many accidents have &#8747;hewn the nece&#8747;&#8747;ity of this caution: but one made &#8747;uch an impre&#8747;&#8747;ion on the country, as a century cannot efface.  Several people in the neighbourhood of Bowne&#8747;s, having been attending a fair at Hawk&#8747;hed, a town on the other &#8747;ide of the lake, had embarked, in the evening, on their return home.  But before this little voyage could be performed, &#8747;o violent a &#8747;torm aro&#8747;e, that their boats foundered; and no fewer than forty-&#8747;even per&#8747;ons peri&#8747;hed<ptr target="n5"/>.</p>

<p>FROM Amble&#8747;ide we propo&#8747;ed to &#8747;et out for Ke&#8747;wick; being obliged, for want of time, to leave one &#8747;cene behind us, which we wi&#8747;hed much to vi&#8747;it -- that of Furne&#8747;s-abbey.  But the lo&#8747;s was in a great mea&#8747;ure made up, and our curio&#8747;ity &#8747;atisfied, by the accounts and drawings of Mr. John Smith<ptr target="n6"/>, an ingenious young painter, who had been &#8747;tudying the ruins on the &#8747;pot.</p>
<note id="n6">This arti&#8747;t has had a principal hand in etching the drawings which accompany the&#8747;e ob&#8747;ervations.</note>
<p>Furne&#8747;s-abbey lies about twenty miles from Amble&#8747;ide, beyond tho&#8747;e mountains, which range on the we&#8747;tern &#8747;ide of Windermere.  It is &#8747;ituated in a beautiful valley, in the mid&#8747;t
<pb n="157.1"/>
<gap desc="unclear landscape orientated oval picture"/>
<pb n="158"/>
of a wide, open, cultivated country, which ri&#8747;es every where in large &#8747;wells; but is no where diver&#8747;ified by any objects of picture&#8747;que beauty.  In &#8747;o inanimate a &#8747;cene we are &#8747;urprized to find a valley of &#8747;o different a &#8747;tructure; adorned with rock, and wood; through which winds a rapid &#8747;tream.</p>
<p>At the entrance of this &#8747;cene &#8747;tands the village of Dalton; from whence the valley, winding about four miles in one large, &#8747;weeping, narrow curve, opens on a rich view of Cartmel-bay.</p>
<p>About a mile within the valley, in the wide&#8747;t part, &#8747;tands the abbey.  It &#8747;eems to have been con&#8747;tructed in a good &#8747;tyle of Gothic architecture; and has &#8747;uffered, from the hand of time, only &#8747;uch depredations, as picture&#8747;que beauty requires.  The <i>intire plan</i> of the abbey-church, and a large <i>fragment</i> of it, &#8747;till remain.  The tower in the centre, which &#8747;eems never to have been lofty, is perforated with large arches.  At the end of the we&#8747;tern aile &#8747;tand the ruins of a low, &#8747;imple tower, where the bells of the abbey are &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed to have hung: and from the &#8747;outh aile projects a building, which is called the chapter-hou&#8747;e.  The cloy&#8747;ters are continued in the &#8747;ame di-
<pb n="159"/>
rection; one wall of which, and all the internal &#8747;tructure are gone.  At the end of the cloy&#8747;ters ari&#8747;es a very rich and picture&#8747;que fragment, which is called the <i>&#8747;chool</i>.</p>
<p>Round the whole runs an irregular wall, which cro&#8747;&#8747;ing the valley in two places, and mounting it's &#8747;ides, makes a circuit of about two miles.  In many parts it is hid with trees, or &#8747;hrubs: in &#8747;ome parts, where it is di&#8747;covered, it is beautiful; and in very few, di&#8747;gu&#8747;ting.</p>
<p>In this wall are two gates, one to the north, and the other to the we&#8747;t; which &#8747;eem to have been the only outlets of the place.  That to the north has been the great entrance: the other has more the appearance of a po&#8747;tern with a porter's lodge.</p>
<p>The proprietor of this noble &#8747;cene is lord George Cavendi&#8747;h, who is a faithful guardian of it, and, I am informed, takes care to prevent any further depredations.</p>
<p>From Amble&#8747;ide we &#8747;et out for Ke&#8747;wick, which is about eighteen miles farther north.</p>
<p>We were now about to enter the middle, and mo&#8747;t formidable part, of that va&#8747;t chain
<pb n="160"/>
of mountains, which I have before mentioned, as the barrier between Cumberland, and We&#8747;tmoreland; and which promi&#8747;ed, from a di&#8747;tant view, to pre&#8747;ent us with a great variety of very grand &#8747;cenery.  Our morning's voyage on the &#8747;mooth expan&#8747;e of the lake aided our pre&#8747;ent expedition with all the powers of contra&#8747;t.</p>
<p>But before we enter the&#8747;e maje&#8747;tic &#8747;cenes, it may be nece&#8747;&#8747;ary to premi&#8747;e a di&#8747;tinction between a <i>&#8747;cene of mountains</i>, and a <i>mountain &#8747;cene</i>.</p>
<p>Mountainous countries mo&#8747;t commonly pre&#8747;ent only the former.  The objects are grand; but they are huddled together, confu&#8747;ed, without connection; and the painter con&#8747;iders them onoly as <i>&#8747;tudies</i>; and forms them into pictures by <i>imaginary combinations</i>.</p>
<p>We &#8747;omtimes however &#8747;ee a mountainous country, in which nature it&#8747;elf hath made the&#8747;e beautiful combinations -- where one part relates to another, and the effect of a whole is produced.  This is what I call a <i>mountain &#8747;cene</i>.</p>
<pb n="161"/>
<p>Of this latter kind is almo&#8747;t the whole road between Amble&#8747;ide, and Ke&#8747;wick.  The mountains are <i>naturally</i> combined into &#8747;cenes; which if not, in all parts, purely picture&#8747;que; are, in all parts, marked with the great lines of compo&#8747;ition; tho often on too wide a &#8747;cale for imitation.</p>
<p>The fir&#8747;t object of our attention, on leaving Amble&#8747;ide, was Rydal-hall, the &#8747;eat of Sir Michael le Fleming.  It &#8747;tands on a ri&#8747;ing lawn.  On the north and ea&#8747;t it is &#8747;heltered by lofty mountains.  In front, towards the &#8747;outh, it commands a noble di&#8747;tance, con&#8747;i&#8747;ting of the exten&#8747;ive vale of Windermere, bounded by the lake.  The mountain, on the north, called Rydal-cragg, ri&#8747;ing clo&#8747;e behind the hou&#8747;e, is high and rocky.  That on the ea&#8747;t, is of inferior &#8747;ize, but is covered with wood.  Between the&#8747;e mountains runs a narrow, wooded valley; through which a con&#8747;iderable &#8747;tream, falling down a quick de&#8747;cent, along a rocky channel, forms a &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ion of ca&#8747;cades.</p>
<p>One of the&#8747;e, tho but a miniature, is &#8747;o beautiful both in it&#8747;elf, and in it's accompaniments, as to de&#8747;erve particular notice. -- It is
<pb n="162"/>
&#8747;een from a &#8747;ummer-hou&#8747;e; before which it's rocky cheeks circling on each &#8747;ide form a little area; appearing through the window like a picture in a frame.  The water falls within a few yards of the eye, which being rather above it's level, has a long per&#8747;pective view of the &#8747;tream, as it hurries from the higher grounds; tumbling, in various, little breaks, through it's rocky channel, darkened with thicket, till it arrive at the edge of the precipice, before the window; from whence it ru&#8747;hes into the ba&#8747;on, which is formed by nature in the native rock.  The dark colour of the &#8747;tone, taking &#8747;till a deeper tinge from the wood, which hangs over it, &#8747;ets off to wonderful advantage the &#8747;parkling lu&#8747;tre of the &#8747;tream; and produces an uncommon effect of light.  It is this effect indeed, from which the chief beauty of the &#8747;cene ari&#8747;es.  In every repre&#8747;entation, truly picture&#8747;que, the &#8747;hade &#8747;hould greatly overbalance the light. The face of nature, under the glow of noon, has rarely this beautiful appearance.  The arti&#8747;t therefore generally courts her charms in a morning, or an evening hour, when the &#8747;hadows are deep, and extended; and when the &#8747;loping &#8747;un-beam affords rather a catching,
<pb n="163"/>
than a glaring light.  In this little exhibition we had an admirable idea of the magical effect of light picture&#8747;quely di&#8747;tributed.</p>
<p>On leaving Rydal, we entered a va&#8747;t cha&#8747;m between two mountains, which may properly be called a portal to the &#8747;cenes we approached.</p>
<p>On pa&#8747;&#8747;ing it, we were pre&#8747;ented with a grand <i>&#8747;cene of mountains</i>; adorned by a lake, called Rydal-water, on the left; not indeed adequate to the greatne&#8747;s of the &#8747;urrounding objects; but of &#8747;uch beauty, as immediately to fix the eye.  In the mid&#8747;t of it is a rocky i&#8747;land, covered with wood.  The little river Rotha, winding round a promontory, enters it on the north.</p>
<p>Leaving the&#8747;e &#8747;cenes, we a&#8747;cended a very &#8747;teep hill; from the &#8747;ummit of which was di&#8747;played a pro&#8747;pect of de&#8747;olation in a very dignified form.  It was an amphitheatre of craggy mountains, which appeared to &#8747;weep round a circumference of at lea&#8747;t thirty miles; tho in fact, perhaps it did not include half that &#8747;pace.  But great objects naturally form a
<pb n="164"/>
wide &#8747;cale of men&#8747;uration. -- The &#8747;oul involuntarily &#8747;huddered at the fir&#8747;t a&#8747;pect of &#8747;uch a &#8747;cene. -- At the di&#8747;tant part of it lay Gra&#8747;mer-lake; which being &#8747;o far removed from the eye, &#8747;eemed only a bright &#8747;pot at the bottom of the mountains.</p>
<p>To this lake the road directly led.  A nearer approach pre&#8747;ented us with &#8747;ome beautiful views on it's banks; tho, on the whole, it's principal merit con&#8747;i&#8747;ted in refre&#8747;hing the eye with a &#8747;mooth expan&#8747;e of water, in the mid&#8747;t of &#8747;uch a variety of rough mountain-&#8747;cenery.  As we &#8747;kirted it's limits, it &#8747;eemed larger, than that of Rydal; and tho it appeared like a &#8747;pot at a di&#8747;tance, became now the principal feature of this va&#8747;t vale.</p>
<p>From hence the road led us into another amphitheatre, wild, and immen&#8747;e like the former; but varied greatly in the &#8747;hapes of the mountains; which were here more broken and irregular; &#8747;hooting, in many places, into craggy &#8747;ummits, and broken points.</p>
<p>And yet even the&#8747;e wild &#8747;cenes, covered, as they are, with craggs, and &#8747;carce furni&#8747;hing the lea&#8747;t tint of vegetation, are &#8747;ubject to rights,
<pb n="165"/>
for which none but the hard inhabitant would think it worth his while to contend.  You &#8747;ee every where their bare, and barren &#8747;ides marked with partition-walls -- &#8747;tones without morter, laid upon each other, cro&#8747;&#8747;ing at right angles; and running down &#8747;teeps, and along precipices, where the eye can &#8747;carce conceive they could have any foundation.  All the&#8747;e <i>partitions of de&#8747;olation</i>, as they may be called, have their inhabitants; each maintaining a few &#8747;tunted &#8747;heep, which picking the meagre tufts of gra&#8747;s, which grow under the &#8747;heltered &#8747;ides of craggs, and &#8747;tones, earn, like their owners, a hard &#8747;ub&#8747;i&#8747;tence.</p>
<p>At the conclu&#8747;ion of this immen&#8747;e amphitheatre, into which we la&#8747;t entered, we found an exit, equal to the &#8747;cene -- another grand mountain-gap, or portal, through which the road carried us up another &#8747;teep mountain -- At the top we pau&#8747;ed, and looking back on the &#8747;cenes we had left, were pre&#8747;ented with a view, which wholly filled the imagination.</p>
<p>It was a <i>retro&#8747;pect</i> of the amphitheatre we had pa&#8747;&#8747;ed; but in a &#8747;tyle &#8747;till grander, than the pro&#8747;pect of it.  It was more &#8747;trongly marked with great out-lines of compo&#8747;ition; and was, of cour&#8747;e, more a whole.</p>
<pb n="166"/>
<p>A wide vale, thrown by per&#8747;pective into a circular form, lay before the eye.  Here al&#8747;o the di&#8747;tant part &#8747;eemed occupied by the lake of Gra&#8747;mer; but a greyi&#8747;h mi&#8747;t left the idea ambiguous.  Beyond the lake aro&#8747;e various mountains, which bounded it: and &#8747;till beyond the&#8747;e, appeared the blue heads of other mountains.  Tho&#8747;e, which formed the &#8747;ide-&#8747;creens of the vale, advancing forward from the di&#8747;tant mountains beyond the lake, approached the eye in a grand &#8747;weep, by the ea&#8747;y gradations of per&#8747;pective.  The promontories, and rece&#8747;&#8747;es, of the more removed parts were marked by a faint &#8747;hadow; till by degrees both the &#8747;ide-&#8747;creens, growing boldly on the eye, were lo&#8747;t behind the two cheeks of the craggy portal, which, with the road between them, formed a fore-ground equal to the &#8747;cene.  The whole view is entirely of the horrid kind.  Not a tree appeared to add the lea&#8747;t chearfulne&#8747;s to it.</p>
<p>With regard to the adorning of &#8747;uch a &#8747;cene with figures, nothing could &#8747;uit it better than a group of banditti.  Of all the &#8747;cenes I ever &#8747;aw, this was the mo&#8747;t adapted to the perpetration of &#8747;ome dreadful deed.  The imagination can hardly avoid conceiving a band of robbers lurking under the &#8747;helter of &#8747;ome pro-
<pb n="167"/>
jecting rock; and expecting the traveller, as he approaches along the valley below.</p>
<p>Nothing however of this kind was ever heard of in the country.  The depredations of foxed, are the only depredations, to which the cottages in the&#8747;e vallies are expo&#8747;ed.  Our po&#8747;tilion pointed to a rugged part on the &#8747;ummit of a rocky mountain on the left, which, he told us, was the great harbour of the&#8747;e animals.  Here they bred; from hence they infe&#8747;ted the country; and to this inacce&#8747;&#8747;ible a&#8747;ylum they retreated in the hour of alarm.</p>
<p>After we left the two amphitheatres, ju&#8747;t de&#8747;cribed, we met with nothing bery intere&#8747;ting, till we came to the celebrated pa&#8747;s, known by the name of <i>Dunmail-Rai&#8747;e</i>, which divides the counties of Cumberland, and We&#8747;tmoreland.</p>
<p>The hi&#8747;tory of this rude monument, which con&#8747;i&#8747;ts of a mon&#8747;trous pile of &#8747;tones, heaped on each &#8747;ide of an earthen mound, is little known.  It was probably intended to mark a divi&#8747;ion, not between tho&#8747;e two northern counties; but rather between the two kingdoms of England, and Scotland, in elder times, when the Scotti&#8747;h border extended
<pb n="168"/>
beyond it's pre&#8747;ent bounds.  And indeed this chain of mountains &#8747;eems to be a much more natural divi&#8747;ion of the two kingdoms, in this part, than a little river in a champaign country, like the E&#8747;k, which now divides them.  It is &#8747;aid, this divi&#8747;ion was made by a Saxon prince, on the death of Dunmail the la&#8747;t king of Cumberland, who was here &#8747;lain in battle. -- But for whatever purpo&#8747;e this rude pile was fabricated, it hath yet &#8747;uffered little change in it's dimen&#8747;ions; and is one of tho&#8747;e monuments of antiquity, which may be characterized by the &#8747;criptural phra&#8747;e of <i>remaining to this very day</i>.</p>
<p>The entrance<ptr target="n7"/> into Cumberland pre&#8747;ents us with a &#8747;cene very &#8747;trongly marked with the &#8747;ublime; grander, tho le&#8747; picture&#8747;que, than the amphitheatre we had pa&#8747;&#8747;ed.  It is a vi&#8747;ta of mountains pur&#8747;uing each other, if I may &#8747;o phra&#8747;e it, through an ea&#8747;y de&#8747;cent
<pb n="169"/>
of not le&#8747;s than &#8747;ix, or &#8747;even miles; and clo&#8747;ed at the di&#8747;tant end by Wyburn-lake, a con&#8747;iderable piece of water.</p>
<note id="n7">There are three pa&#8747;&#8747;ages, over this chain of mountains, into Cumberland.  This by <i>Amble&#8747;ide</i>, is the wilde&#8747;t, and mo&#8747;t picture&#8747;que.  A &#8747;econd by <i>Brough</i> over Stainmore, is dreary, rather than wild: and a third by <i>Shap</i>, is both.</note>
<p>This &#8747;cene is great in all it's parts; and in it's general compo&#8747;ition.  The mountains, of which the &#8747;ide-&#8747;creens of this vi&#8747;ta are formed, fall generally in ea&#8747;y lines, and range at the di&#8747;tance of a mile and a half, or two miles, from each other.  But it is difficult to a&#8747;certain a di&#8747;tance of this kind: for as the mountain ri&#8747;es <i>gradually</i> from it's ba&#8747;e, we cannot ea&#8747;ily fix where it begins.  It is enough to ob&#8747;erve, that through the whole immen&#8747;ity of the view before us there appeared no di&#8747;proportion.</p>
<p>Among the mountains, which compo&#8747;e this magnificent &#8747;cene, there is one on the right, of &#8747;uperior grandeur,; &#8747;tretching, near a league and a half, in one va&#8747;t concave ridge.  This mountain is known by the name of <i>Helvellin</i>; with which three mountains only, through this va&#8747;t region, di&#8747;pute the point of altitude -- Cro&#8747;s-fell -- Gra&#8747;mer -- and Skiddaw.  The inhabitants of it's invirons give it univer&#8747;ally for Helvellin: but, I believe, it is no where el&#8747;e treated with &#8747;uch re&#8747;pect.</p>
<pb n="170"/>
<p>Be&#8747;ides the general grandeur of this view, there is a wonderful variety in the &#8747;hapes of the &#8747;everal mountains, which compo&#8747;e it.  Nature's vi&#8747;tas are never formed by rule, and compa&#8747;s.  Whenever &#8747;he deviates towards a regular &#8747;hape, &#8747;he does it with that negligent air of greatne&#8747;s, which marks &#8747;ublimity of genius.  No attention to trifles characterizes her &#8747;cenes.  Her very regularities di&#8747;cover tho&#8747;e &#8747;trong touches of contra&#8747;t, that range of imagination, which de&#8747;troys every idea of &#8747;amene&#8747;s.</p>
<p>Of all the rude &#8747;cenery we had yet vi&#8747;ited, none is equalled this in <i> de&#8747;olation</i>.  The whole is one immen&#8747;ity of barrenne&#8747;s.  The mountains are univer&#8747;ally over&#8747;pread with craggs, and &#8747;tones, which are &#8747;ometimes &#8747;cattered carele&#8747;sly over their &#8747;urfaces; and &#8747;ometimes appear &#8747;hivering in ca&#8747;cades of crumbling fragments down their &#8747;ides.  Helvellin, through all it's &#8747;pace, is one intire pavement.  Nor is the view disfigured by the abundance of this more ordinary &#8747;pecies of rock<ptr target="n8"/>.  In it's va&#8747;tne&#8747;s the parts coale&#8747;ce; and become a

whole. -- The fractured rock, &#8747;o beautiful in it&#8747;elf, is calculated rather for &#8747;maller pictures.  Here it would be lo&#8747;t.</p>
<note id="n8">See pages 108.</note>
<p>The&#8747;e va&#8747;t regions, who&#8747;e parts are thus ab&#8747;orbed in the immen&#8747;ity of a whole, have the &#8747;tronge&#8747;t effect on the imagination.  They di&#8747;tend the mind, and fix it in a kind of &#8747;tupor:</p>

<p>We now approached the lake of Wyburn, or Thirlmer, as it is &#8747;ometimes called; an object every way &#8747;uited to the ideas of de&#8747;olation, which &#8747;urround it.  No tufted verdure graces it's banks, nor hanging woods throw rich reflections on it's &#8747;urface: but every form, which it &#8747;ugge&#8747;ts, is &#8747;avage, and de&#8747;olate.  It is about two miles in length, and half as much in breadth, &#8747;urrounded by barren mountains, and precipices, &#8747;helving into it in all directions:</p>

<pb n="172"/>
<p>And to impre&#8747;s &#8747;till more the characteri&#8747;tic idea of the place; the road hanging over it, ran along the edge of a precipice. -- One peculiar feature al&#8747;o belongs to it.  About the middle of the lake, the &#8747;hores, on each &#8747;ide, nearly uniting, are joined by an Alpine bridge.  I did no ob&#8747;erve any picture&#8747;que beauty ari&#8747;ing from this circum&#8747;tance: but rather a formality; at lea&#8747;t from the &#8747;tand, where I viewed it.  A communication however of this kind rather increa&#8747;es the romantic idea.</p>
<p>Beyond Wyburn-lake we deviated into a mere <i>&#8747;cene of mountains</i>.  Nature &#8747;eemed to have aimed at &#8747;ome mode of compo&#8747;ition, which &#8747;he had left unfini&#8747;hed; but it was difficult to conceive, what &#8747;pecies of land&#8747;cape &#8747;he meant; a <i>valley</i>, or a <i>woody rece&#8747;s</i>; a <i>barren &#8747;cene</i>, or a <i>cultivated one</i>.  There was a mixture of all.</p>
<p>This mi&#8747;cellaneous pa&#8747;&#8747;age however did not continue long.  It appeared only a &#8747;hort interruption of the grand vi&#8747;ta, from which we had deviated at the lake of Wyburn; and into which we now returned.  Nature however &#8747;eemed to have &#8747;pent her force in her fir&#8747;t
<pb n="173"/>
effort; which was greatly &#8747;uperior to the &#8747;econd.</p>
<p>The thickets among the&#8747;e mountains, and indeed many other parts of the country, are frequented by the wild-cat; which Mr. Pennant calls the Briti&#8747;h tyger; and &#8747;ays, it is the fierce&#8747;t, and mo&#8747;t de&#8747;tructive bea&#8747;t we have.  He &#8747;peaks of it as being three or four times as large as the common cat.  We &#8747;aw one dead, which had been hunted on the day we &#8747;aw it; and it &#8747;eemed very little inferior, if at all, to the &#8747;ize he mentions.</p>
<p>By this time we approached Ke&#8747;wick; and from the de&#8747;cent of Ca&#8747;tle-hill, at about two miles di&#8747;tance, had an exten&#8747;ive view of the whole country around that celebrated &#8747;cene of romantic beauty.</p>
<p>Before us lay a plain many leagues in circumference, divided into two large portions; each of which is floated by a lake.  <i>Derwent-water</i> over&#8747;preads the nearer; and <i>Ba&#8747;&#8747;enthwait</i>, the more di&#8747;tant.  Surrounding the whole, ri&#8747;es a va&#8747;t, circular chain of mountains; and tow-
<pb n="174"/>
ering over them all, on the ea&#8747;tern &#8747;ide of the i&#8747;thmus, &#8747;tands the mountain of Skiddaw.  We had heard too much of this mountain, to meet it properly: it has none of tho&#8747;e bold projections, and &#8747;haggy majesty about it, which we expected to have &#8747;een in this king of mountains.  It is a tame, inanimate object; except at &#8747;uch a di&#8747;tance, as &#8747;mooths the imbo&#8747;&#8747;ed work of all the&#8747;e rich fabrics; and where it's double top makes it a di&#8747;tingui&#8747;hed object to mark, and characterize a &#8747;cene. -- But if the mountain di&#8747;appointed us; the &#8747;cene, over which it pre&#8747;ided, went beyond our imagination.</p>
<p>This rich, exten&#8747;ive view was aided, when we &#8747;aw it, by all the powers (or, more properly, the re&#8747;plendency) of light and &#8747;hade.  The morning had been fine: but in the afternoon the clouds began to gather, threatening rain.  A heavy &#8747;ky over&#8747;pread the higher, and middle regions o the air with all the &#8747;olemnity of gloom; dropping it's dark mantle to the &#8747;kirts of the horizon.  Ju&#8747;t as we arrived at the brow of the hill, with the &#8747;cenery of the two lakes, and their accompaniments before us, the &#8747;etting &#8747;un bur&#8747;t forth in a glow of &#8747;plendor.</p>
<pb n="175"/>
<p>If a <i>common</i> &#8747;un-&#8747;et often gives a beautiful appearance even to an <i>ordinary</i> land&#8747;cape; what mu&#8747;t have been the effect of an <i>uncommon</i> one, on &#8747;uch a land&#8747;cape as this -- a &#8747;un-&#8747;et not merely a <i>flood of &#8747;plendor</i>, but contra&#8747;ted by the fulle&#8747;t depth of &#8747;hade?  Here we had the beauties of the little &#8747;ummer-hou&#8747;e &#8747;cene, on the mo&#8747;t exten&#8747;ive &#8747;cale.  The effect was a&#8747;toni&#8747;hing.  The whole was a &#8747;cene of glory -- but a &#8747;cene of glory painted by the hand of nature.  Tho every part glowed with tran&#8747;cendent lu&#8747;tre; the whole was in nice&#8747;t harmony.  But it was a tran&#8747;itory vi&#8747;ion.  While we gazed; it faded: and in a few moments nothing was left, but the great outlines -- the grand compo&#8747;ition of the &#8747;cene.  We &#8747;hould have &#8747;tood over it even thus, in rapture; if we had not ju&#8747;t &#8747;een what a &#8747;plendid addition it was capable of receiving.</p>
<p>We have a grand picture from the pencil of a great ma&#8747;ter, of the clo&#8747;e of &#8747;uch an evening.</p>

<p>Here we have all the re&#8747;plendency of light; but not a &#8747;ufficient balance of &#8747;hade.  Milton gives the balance in the other &#8747;cale.  If Thom&#8747;on had introduced, like Milton, <i>the louring element &#8747;cowling over his darkened land&#8747;cape</i>, his re&#8747;plendent tints would have had their full force; and the effect had been complete.</p>

&#8747;uperior to Amble&#8747;ide.  Between the two places there is a great re&#8747;emblance.  Ke&#8747;wick &#8747;tands at the north-point of Derwent-water; which is the very point, that Amble&#8747;ide occupies on Windermere.  But the &#8747;ituation of Amble&#8747;ide is more romantic, as it &#8747;tands more in the middle of that chain of mountains, which &#8747;eparates the two counties.  At Ke&#8747;wick the roughne&#8747;&#8747;es of the country are wearing off: for in a few miles beyond it, this great barrier ends.</p>
<p>Here we re&#8747;olved to fix our head-quarters for a few days; and from thence to vi&#8747;it &#8747;uch of the neighbouring lakes, and mountains, as had been mo&#8747;t recommended to our notice.</p>

<p>ON the 9th of June we &#8747;et out on <i>hor&#8747;eback</i> (which I mention, as it is the only conveyance the road will admit) on an expedition into Borrodale; a wild country &#8747;outh-we&#8747;t of Ke&#8747;wick.  Our road led along the lake of <i>Derwent</i>, which was the fir&#8747;t object we &#8747;urveyed.</p>
<p>But before we examined the particulars of this grand &#8747;cene, we took a general view of the whole, from it's northern &#8747;hore; which is the only part unblockaded by mountains.  This is the i&#8747;thmian part, which joins the valley of Derwent-water with that of Ba&#8747;&#8747;enthwait.  It was ea&#8747;y from the higher grounds of this i&#8747;thmus to obtain the &#8747;tation we de&#8747;ired.</p>
<pb n="180"/>
<p>The <i>lake of Derwent</i>, or <i>Ke&#8747;wick-lake</i>, as it is generally called, is contained within a circumference of about ten miles; pre&#8747;enting it&#8747;elf in a circular form, tho in fact it is rather oblong.  It's area is inter&#8747;per&#8747;ed with four or five i&#8747;lands: three of which only are of con&#8747;equence, <i>Lord's i&#8747;land</i>, <i>Vicar's i&#8747;land</i>, and <i>St. Herbert's i&#8747;land:</i> but none of them is comparable to the i&#8747;land on Windermere, in point either of &#8747;ize, or beauty.</p>
<p>If a painter were de&#8747;irous of &#8747;tudying the whole circumference of the lake from one &#8747;tation, St. Herbert's i&#8747;land is the &#8747;pot he &#8747;hould choo&#8747;e; from whence, as from a centre, he might &#8747;ee it in rotation.  I have &#8747;een a &#8747;et of drawings taken from this &#8747;tand; which were hung round a circular room, and intended to give a general idea of the boundaries of the lake.  But as no repre&#8747;entation could be give of the lake it&#8747;elf; the idea was lo&#8747;t, and the drawings made but an awkward appearance.</p>
<pb n="181"/>
<p>Lord's i&#8747;land had it's name being the place, where once &#8747;tood a plea&#8747;ure-hou&#8747;e, belonging to the unfortunate family of Derwent-water, which took it's title from this lake.  The ancient manor-hou&#8747;e &#8747;tood on Ca&#8747;tle-hill above Ke&#8747;wick; where antiquarian traces al&#8747;o the ve&#8747;tiges of a Roman fort.  But an heire&#8747;s of Derwent-water marring into the family of the Ratcliffs; the family-&#8747;eat was removed from Ke&#8747;wick to Dil&#8747;ton in Northumberland.</p>
<p>As the boundaries of this lake are more mountainous than tho&#8747;e of Windermere; they, of cour&#8747;e, afford more <i>romantic &#8747;cenery</i>.  But tho the whole &#8747;hore, except the &#8747;pot where we &#8747;tood, is incircled with mountains; they rarely fall abruptly into the water; which is girt almo&#8747;t round by a margin of meadow -- on the we&#8747;tern &#8747;hores e&#8747;pecially.  On the ea&#8747;tern, the mountains approach nearer the water; and in &#8747;ome parts fall perpendicularly into it.  But as we &#8747;tood viewing the lake from it's northern &#8747;hores, all the&#8747;e marginal parts were lo&#8747;t; and
<pb n="182"/>
the mountains (tho in fact they de&#8747;cribe a circle of twenty miles, which is double the circumference of the lake) appeared univer&#8747;ally to ri&#8747;e from the water's edge.</p>
<p>Along it's we&#8747;tern &#8747;hores on the right, they ri&#8747;e &#8747;mooth and uniform; and are therefore rather lumpi&#8747;h.  The more removed part of this mountain-line is elegant: but, in &#8747;ome parts, it is di&#8747;agreeably broken.</p>
<p>On the ea&#8747;tern &#8747;ide, the mountains are both grander, and more picture&#8747;que.  The line is plea&#8747;ing; and is filled with that variety of objects, broken-ground, -- rocks, -- and wood, which being well combined, take from the heavine&#8747;s of a mountain; and give it an airy lightne&#8747;s.</p>
<p>The <i>front</i>-&#8747;creen, (if we may &#8747;o call a portion of a circular form,) is more formidable, than either of the &#8747;ides.  But it's line is le&#8747;s elegant, than that of the ea&#8747;tern-&#8747;creen.  The fall of Lodoar, which adorns that part of the lake, is an object of no con&#8747;equence at the di&#8747;tance we now &#8747;tood.  But in our intended ride we propo&#8747;ed to take a nearer view of it.</p>
<pb n="183"/>
<p>Of all the lakes in the&#8747;e romantic regions, the lake we are now examining, &#8747;eems to be mo&#8747;t generally admired.  It was once admirably characterized by an ingenious per&#8747;on,<ptr target="n9"/> who, on his fir&#8747;t &#8747;eeing it, cryed out, <i>Here is beauty indeed -- Beauty lying in the lap of Horrour!</i>  We do not often find a happier illu&#8747;tration.  Nothing conveys an idea of <i>beauty</i> more &#8747;trongly, than the lake; nor of <i>horrour</i>, than the mountains; and the former <i>lying in the lap</i> of the latter, expre&#8747;&#8747;es in a &#8747;trong manner the mode of their combination.  The late Dr. Brown, who was a man of ta&#8747;te, and had &#8747;een every part of this country, &#8747;ingled out the &#8747;cenery of this lake for it's peculiar beauty<ptr target="n10"/>.  And unque&#8747;tionably it is, in many places, very &#8747;weetly romantic; particularly along it's ea&#8747;tern, and &#8747;outhern &#8747;hores: but to give it <i>pre-eminence</i> may be paying it perhaps as much too high a compliment; as it would be too
<pb n="184"/>
rigorous to make any but a few comparative objections.</p>
<note id="n9">The late Mr. Avi&#8747;on, organi&#8747;t of St. Nicholas at Newca&#8747;tle upon Tyne.</note>
<note id="n10">In a letter to Lord Lyttelton, quoted above.</note>
<p>In the fir&#8747;t place, it's form, which in appearance is circular, is le&#8747;s intere&#8747;ting, I think, than the winding &#8747;weep of Windermere, and &#8747;ome other lakes; which lo&#8747;ing them&#8747;elves in va&#8747;t reaches, behind &#8747;ome cape or promontory, add to their other beauties the varieties of di&#8747;tance, and per&#8747;pective.  Some people object to this, as touching rather on the character of the river.  But does that injure it's beauty?  And yet I believe there are very few rivers, which form &#8747;uch reaches, as the lake of Windermere.</p>
<p>To the formality of it's &#8747;hores may be added the formality of it's i&#8747;lands.  They are round, regular, and &#8747;imilar &#8747;pots, as they appear from mo&#8747;t points of view; formal in their &#8747;ituation, as well as in their &#8747;hape; and of little advantage to the &#8747;cene.  The i&#8747;lands of Windermere are in them&#8747;elves better &#8747;haped; more varied; and uniting together, add a beauty, and contra&#8747;t to the whole.</p>
<p>But among the greate&#8747;t objections to this lake is the abrupt, and broken line in &#8747;everal of the mountains, which compo&#8747;e it's &#8747;creens, (e&#8747;pecially on the we&#8747;tern, and on part of
<pb n="185"/>
the &#8747;outhern &#8747;hore) which is more remarkable, than on any of the other lakes.  We have little of the ea&#8747;y &#8747;weep of a mountain-line: at lea&#8747;t the eye is hurt with too many tops of mountains, which injure the ideas of &#8747;implicity, and grandeur.  Great care therefore &#8747;hould be taken in &#8747;electing views of this lake.  If there is a littlene&#8747;s even amid&#8747;t the grand ideas of the original, what can we expect from repre&#8747;entations on paper, or canvas?  I have &#8747;een &#8747;ome views of this lake, injudiciou&#8747;ly cho&#8747;en, or taken on too exten&#8747;ive a &#8747;cale, in which the mountains appear like hay-cocks. -- I would be under&#8747;tood however to &#8747;peak chiefly of the appearance, which the lines of the&#8747;e mountains <i>occa&#8747;ionally</i> make.  When we change our point of view, the mountain-line changes al&#8747;o, and may be beautiful in one point, tho it is di&#8747;plea&#8747;ing in another.</p>
<p>Having thus take a view of the <i>whole lake together</i> from it's northern point, we proceeded on our rout to Borrodale, &#8747;kirting the ea&#8747;tern coa&#8747;t along the edge of the water.  The grand &#8747;ide-&#8747;creen, on the left hung over us; and we found it as beautifully romantic,
<pb n="186"/>
and plea&#8747;ing to the imagination, when it's rocks, precipices, and woods became a fore-ground; as it appeared from the northern point of the lake, when we examined it in a more removed point of view.</p>
<p>Nor do the&#8747;e rocky &#8747;hores recommend them&#8747;elves to us only as fore-grounds.  We found them every where the happie&#8747;t &#8747;tations for obtaining the mo&#8747;t picture&#8747;que views of the lake.  The inexperienced conductor, &#8747;hewing you the lake, carries you to &#8747;ome gari&#8747;h &#8747;tand, where the eye may range far and wide.  And &#8747;uch a view indeed is well calculated, as we have ju&#8747;t &#8747;een, to obtain a general idea of the whole.  But he, who is in que&#8747;t of the picture&#8747;que &#8747;cenes of the lake, mu&#8747;t travel along the rough &#8747;ide-&#8747;creens that adorn it; and catch it's beauties, as they ari&#8747;e in &#8747;maller portions -- it's little bays, and winding &#8747;hores -- it's deep rece&#8747;&#8747;es, and hanging promontories -- it's garni&#8747;hed rock, and di&#8747;tant mountain.  The&#8747;e are, in general, the picture&#8747;que &#8747;cenes, which it affords.</p>
<p>Part of this mountain is known by the name of Lady's-rake, from a tradition, that a young lady of the Derwentwater family, in the time of &#8747;ome public di&#8747;turbance, e&#8747;caped a pur&#8747;uit
<pb n="186.1"/>

<pb n="187"/>
by climbing a precipice, which had been thought inacce&#8747;&#8747;ible. -- A romantic place &#8747;eldom wants a romantic &#8747;tory to adorn it.</p>
<p>Detached from this <i>continent</i> of precipice, if I may &#8747;o &#8747;peak, &#8747;tands a rocky hill, known by the name of <i>Ca&#8747;tellet</i>.  Under the beetling brow of the natural ruin we pa&#8747;&#8747;ed; and as we viewed it upwards from it's ba&#8747;e, it &#8747;eemed a fabric of &#8747;uch grandeur, that alone it was &#8747;ufficient to give dignity to any &#8747;cene.  We were de&#8747;ired to take particular notice of it for a rea&#8747;on, which &#8747;hall afterwards be mentioned.</p>
<p>As we proceeded in our rout along the lake, the road grew wilder, and more romantic.  There is not an idea more tremendous, than that of riding along the edge of a precipice, unguarded by an parapet, under impending rocks, which threaten above; while the &#8747;urges of a flood, or the whirlpools of a rapid river, terrify below.</p>
<p>Many &#8747;uch roads there are in various parts of the world; particularly among the mountains of Norway and Sweden; where they are
<pb n="188"/>
carried along precipices of &#8747;uch frightful height, that the trees at the bottom a&#8747;&#8747;ume the azure tint of di&#8747;tance; and the cataracts which roar among them, cannot even be heard, unle&#8747;s the air be perfectly &#8747;till.  The&#8747;e tremendous roads are often not only without rail, or parapet of any kind; but &#8747;o narrow, that travellers in oppo&#8747;ite directions cannot pa&#8747;s, unle&#8747;s one of the draw him&#8747;elf up clo&#8747;e to the rock.  In &#8747;ome places, where the precipice does not afford footing even for this narrow &#8747;helf; or, where it may have foundered, a cleft pine is thrown acro&#8747;s the cha&#8747;m.  The appalled traveller arriving at the &#8747;pot, &#8747;urveys it with di&#8747;may. -- Return, he dare not -- for he knows what a variety of terrors he has already pa&#8747;&#8747;ed. -- Yet if his foot &#8747;lip, or the plank, on which he re&#8747;ts, give way; he will find his death, and his grave together; and never more be heard of.</p>
<p>But here we had not even the miniature of the&#8747;e dreadful ideas, at lea&#8747;t on the &#8747;ide of the lake: for in the &#8747;teepe&#8747;t part, we were &#8747;carce rai&#8747;ed thirty of forty feet above the water.</p>
<pb n="189"/>
<p>As we edged the precipices, we every where &#8747;aw fragments of rock, and large &#8747;tones &#8747;cattered about, which being loo&#8747;ened by fro&#8747;tsw and rains, had fallen from the cliffs above; and &#8747;hew the traveller what dangers he has e&#8747;caped.</p>
<p>Once we found our&#8747;elves in hands more capricious than the elements.  We rode along the edge of a precipice, under a &#8747;teep woody rock; when &#8747;ome large &#8747;tones came rolling from the top, and ru&#8747;hing through the thickets above us, bounded acro&#8747;s the road, and plunged into the lake.  At that in&#8747;tant we had made a pau&#8747;e to ob&#8747;erve &#8747;ome part of the &#8747;cenery; and by half a dozen yards e&#8747;caped mi&#8747;chief.  The wind was loud, and we conceived the &#8747;tones had been di&#8747;lodged by it's violence: but on riding a little further, we di&#8747;covered the real cau&#8747;e.  High above our heads, at the &#8747;ummit of the cliff, &#8747;at a group of mountaineer children, amu&#8747;ing them&#8747;elves with pu&#8747;hing &#8747;tones from the top; and watching, as they plunged into the lake. -- Of us they knew nothing, who were &#8747;creened from them by intervening thickets.</p>
<pb n="190"/>
<p>As we approached the head of the lake, we were de&#8747;ired to turn round, and take a view of Ca&#8747;tellet, that rocky hill, which had appeared &#8747;o enormous, as we &#8747;tood under it.  It had now &#8747;hrunk into nothing in the mid&#8747;t of that &#8747;cene of greatne&#8747;s, which &#8747;urrounded it.  I mention this circum&#8747;tance, as in the&#8747;e wild countries, compari&#8747;on is the only &#8747;cale u&#8747;ed in the men&#8747;uration of mountains.  At lea&#8747;t it was the only &#8747;cale to which we were ever referred.  In countries graced by a <i>&#8747;ingle</i> mountain, the inhabitants may be very accurate in their inve&#8747;tigations of it's height.  The altitude and circumference of the <i>Wrekin</i>, I have no doubt, is accurately known in Shrop&#8747;hire; but in a country like this, where chain is linked to chain exactne&#8747;s would be endle&#8747;s.</p>
<p>By this time we approached the head of the lake; and could now di&#8747;tingui&#8747;h the full &#8747;ound of the fall of Lodoar; which had before reached our ears, as the wind &#8747;uffered, indi&#8747;tinctly in broken notes.</p>
<pb n="191"/>
<p>This water-fall is a noble object, both in it&#8747;elf, and as an ornament of the lake.  It appears more as an object <i>connected with the lake</i>, as we approach by water.  By land, we &#8747;ee it over a promontory of low ground, which, in &#8747;ome degree, hides it's grandeur.  At the di&#8747;tance of a mile, it begins to appear with dignity.</p>
<p>But of whatever advantage the fall of Lodoar may be as a piece of <i>di&#8747;tant</i> &#8747;cenery, it's effect is very noble, when examined <i>on the &#8747;pot</i>.  As a &#8747;ingle object, it wants non accompaniments of off&#8747;kip; which would rather injure, than a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;t it.  They would di&#8747;turb it's &#8747;implicity, and repo&#8747;e.  The greatne&#8747;s of it's parts affords &#8747;cenery enough.  Some in&#8747;truments plea&#8747;e in concert: others you wi&#8747;h to hear alone.</p>
<p>The &#8747;tream falls through a cha&#8747;m between two towering perpendicular rocks.  The intermediate part, broken into large fragments, forms the rough bed of the ca&#8747;cade.  Some of the&#8747;e fragments &#8747;tretching out in &#8747;helves, hold a depth of &#8747;oil &#8747;ufficient for large trees.  Among the&#8747;e broken rocks the &#8747;tream finds it's way through a fall of at lea&#8747;t an hundred feet; and in heavy rains, the water is every way &#8747;uited to the grandeur of the &#8747;cene.  Rocks and
<pb n="192"/>
water in oppo&#8747;ition can hardly produce a more animated &#8747;trife.  The ground at the bottom al&#8747;o is very much broken, and overgrown with trees, and thickets; among&#8747;t which the water is &#8747;wallowed up into an aby&#8747;s; and at length finds it's way, through deep channels, into the lake.  We di&#8747;mounted, and got as near as we could: but were not able to approach &#8747;o near, as to look into the woody cha&#8747;m, which receives the fall.</p>
<p>Having viewed this grand piece of natural ruin, we proceeded in our rout towards the mountains of Borrodale; and &#8747;haping our cour&#8747;e along the &#8747;outhern &#8747;hores of the lake, we came to the river Derwent, which is a little to the we&#8747;t of the Lodoar.</p>
<p>The&#8747;e two rivers, the Lodoar, and the Derwent, furni&#8747;h the chief &#8747;upplies of Derwentwater.  But tho&#8747;e of the latter are much ampler.  The Lodoar accordingly is lo&#8747;t in the lake: while the Derwent, fir&#8747;t giving it's name to it, retains it's own to the &#8747;ea.</p>
<pb n="192.1"/>
<gap desc="unclear landscape orientated oval picture"/>
<pb n="193"/>
<p>On pa&#8747;&#8747;ing this river, and turning the fir&#8747;t great promontory on our left, we found our&#8747;elves in a va&#8747;t rece&#8747;s of mountains.  We had &#8747;een them at a di&#8747;tance, from the northern extremity of the lake.  They were more than objects of grandeur.  But now they had a&#8747;&#8747;umed their full maje&#8747;tic form; &#8747;urrounding us on every &#8747;ide with their lofty barriers; and &#8747;hutting out, in appearance, every idea of an e&#8747;cape.  Wild and various beyond conception were their &#8747;hapes: but they participated rather of the de&#8747;olate, than of the fanta&#8747;tic idea.  From the bottom of the lake indeed they formed too great a combination of pointed &#8747;ummits.  But here all the&#8747;e grote&#8747;que &#8747;hapes di&#8747;appeared.  The &#8747;ummits receded far behind; and we only &#8747;aw the bur&#8747;ting rocks, and bold protuberances, with which the &#8747;ides of the&#8747;e enormous ma&#8747;&#8747;es of &#8747;olid earth are charged.  Many of them are covered, like the &#8747;teeps of Helvellin, with a continued pavement of craggs.</p>
<p>The winding of the Derwent was the clue we followed in our pa&#8747;&#8747;age through the&#8747;e regions of de&#8747;olation.  An aperture between the
<pb n="194"/>
mountains brought us into another wild rece&#8747;s, where a &#8747;imilar &#8747;cene opened; diver&#8747;ified from the fir&#8747;t only by &#8747;ome new forms, or new po&#8747;ition, or varied furniture, of the incumbent mountains.</p>
<p>As we doubled one promontory, another unfolded; and we found our&#8747;elves, not in, what appeared at firt, a rece&#8747;s of moutnains; but in a narrow, winding valley; the &#8747;cenes of which, by quick tran&#8747;itions, were continually &#8747;hifting.  This valley &#8747;o replete with hideous grandeur, is known by the name of the &#8747;traits of Borrodale.</p>
<p>In the middle of one of the rece&#8747;&#8747;es of the valley lies an enormous &#8747;tone; which is called in the country <i>Boother-&#8747;tone</i>.  Ma&#8747;&#8747;y rocks of immen&#8747;e &#8747;ize, rent from mountains, are every where found: but this &#8747;tone appears to be of a different kind.  It does not &#8747;eem to have been the appendage of a mountain; but it&#8747;elf an independent creation.  It lies in a &#8747;ort od diagonal po&#8747;ition; over&#8747;hadowing a &#8747;pace, &#8747;ufficient to &#8747;helter a troop of hor&#8747;e.</p>
<pb n="195"/>
<p>Not far from hence ari&#8747;es a woody hill, called <i>Ca&#8747;tell-cragg</i>; which is al&#8747;o detached from the &#8747;cenery around it.  On the &#8747;ummit of this hill, &#8747;tood formerly a fortre&#8747;s, &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed to be of Roman origin; intended to guard this avenue into the country.  After it had been relinqui&#8747;hed by the Romans, it was occupied by the Saxons; and, after their day, it was given, with all the lands about Borrodale, by one of the lords of Derwent-water, to the monks of Furne&#8747;s.  By the&#8747;e religious it was &#8747;till maintained in it's military capacity; which is perhaps a &#8747;ingular in&#8747;tance of the kind.  But as the Scots, in tho&#8747;e days, made frequent irruptions even thus far into the country; and as the monks had great po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ions to defend in the valley of Borrodale; where one of their principal magazines was e&#8747;tabli&#8747;hed; the holy fathers thought it proper to adopt this uncommon mea&#8747;ure.  Be&#8747;ides their tythe-corn, they ama&#8747;&#8747;ed here the valuable minerals of the country; among which, &#8747;alt, produced from a &#8747;pring in the valley, was no incon&#8747;iderable article.</p>

<p>We had now travelled three of four miles in this winding valley; which, as we advanced, began to a&#8747;&#8747;ume a &#8747;ofter form.  The hills became cloathed with verdure; and the little rece&#8747;&#8747;es of the valley, &#8747;haded with wood.  The&#8747;e rece&#8747;&#8747;es al&#8747;o, which were before &#8747;hut up, and confined by rocky barriers, now opened in different &#8747;hapes; and many of them were plea&#8747;antly varied with wooded hillocs: while the &#8747;tony banks of the Derwent, began to change into meadows; &#8747;canty indeed; but affording pa&#8747;turage for a few cattle; and a plea&#8747;ant tint of verdure, as a contra&#8747;t with the rocky &#8747;cenery in it's neighbourhood.</p>
<p>We were now in that part of the valley, which is <i>properly</i> called the valley of Borrodale -- a large, circular rece&#8747;s, con&#8747;i&#8747;ting of much broken ground; and, except where the valley &#8747;till pur&#8747;ues it's cour&#8747;e, &#8747;urrounded by lofty mountains; from which pour innumerable rills and torrents, tho little intere&#8747;ting in the &#8747;cene, as objects of picture&#8747;que beauty.</p>

<p>Here the &#8747;ons, and daughters of &#8747;implicity enjoy health, peace, and contentment, in the mid&#8747;t of what city-luxury would call the extreme of human nece&#8747;&#8747;ity;</p>

this article is &#8747;ought either in pits, or on the &#8747;urface of the earth.  Here the inhabitants are obliged to get it on the tops of mountains; which abounding with mo&#8747;&#8747;y grounds, &#8747;eldom found in the vallies below, &#8747;upply them with peat.  The difficulty lies in conveying it from &#8747;uch immen&#8747;e heights.  In doing this they have recour&#8747;e to a &#8747;trange, and dangerous expedient; tho &#8747;imilar to the modes of conveyance, which nece&#8747;&#8747;ity dictates in other mountainous countries.  They make their peat into bundles, and fa&#8747;ten it upon &#8747;ledges; on each of which a man &#8747;its, and guides the machine with his foot down the precipice.  We &#8747;aw many tracks along the &#8747;ides of mountains, made by the&#8747;e &#8747;ledges; &#8747;everal of which were four of five hundred feet high, and appeared from the bottom almo&#8747;t perpendicular.</p>
<p>After a long and fatiguing morning we refre&#8747;hed our&#8747;elves at the village of Ro&#8747;thwait on eggs, and mils; and they who cannot be &#8747;atisfied with &#8747;uch a meal in a mountainous country, mu&#8747;t carry their larder with them.</p>

<p>FROM Ro&#8747;thwait the valley pur&#8747;ues it's cour&#8747;e towards the ea&#8747;t; and lo&#8747;ing again it's milder features, grows every &#8747;tep more wild, and de&#8747;olate.  After a march of two miles farther, we came to the village of <i>Satterthwait</i>, &#8747;till more intrenched in mountains, than Ro&#8747;thwait it&#8747;elf.  Here, in the depth of winter, the &#8747;un never &#8747;hines.  As the &#8747;pring advances, his rays begin to &#8747;hoot over the &#8747;outhern mountains; and at high noon to tip the chimney tops of the village.  That radiant &#8747;ign &#8747;hews the cheerle&#8747;s winter to be now over; and rou&#8747;es the hardy pea&#8747;ant to the labours of the coming year.</p>
<p>A little beyond this &#8747;cene of de&#8747;olation, the Derwent, on who&#8747;e banks we &#8747;till continued, ru&#8747;hes down a long declivity between two
<pb n="200"/>
mountains. At the fall of Lodoar the higher level comes <i>abruptly</i> upon the lower: here, the two levels are united by a <i>gradual</i> de&#8747;cent.  The &#8747;treams of cour&#8747;e taking the &#8747;ame modes of precipitations as the land, the Lodoar forms a perpendicular fall; and the Derwent, a declivous one.  But the fall of the Derwent is more &#8747;ingular; and is the only one of the kind perhaps in the country.</p>
<p>And here I cannot help remarking the &#8747;ingular character of this mountain-&#8747;tream.  There is not perhaps a river in England, which pa&#8747;&#8747;es through &#8747;uch a variety of different &#8747;cenes.  What wild, romantic channel it &#8747;hapes, before it enter the vale of Borrodale, is to us unknown.  There fir&#8747;t we commenced our acquaintance with it.  It's pa&#8747;&#8747;age through that mountain-cha&#8747;m, is marked with objects, not only great in them&#8747;elves; but rarely to be found el&#8747;ewhere in &#8747;uch intere&#8747;ting combinations.</p>
<p>From a mountain-&#8747;tream it &#8747;oon a&#8747;&#8747;umes a new character, and changes into a lake; where it di&#8747;plays the wonders, we have ju&#8747;t &#8747;een.</p>
<p>From hence emerging, it again becomes a river: but &#8747;oon forms the lake of Ba&#8747;&#8747;enthwait;
<pb n="201"/>
of form, and dimen&#8747;ions very different from that of Ke&#8747;wick.</p>
<p>Contracting it&#8747;elf again into a river, it puts on a character intirely new.  Hitherto it has adorned only the wild, rough &#8747;cenes of nature.  All the&#8747;e it now relinqui&#8747;hes -- rocks -- lakes -- and mountains; and enters a &#8747;weet delightful country, where all it's accompaniments are &#8747;oft, and lovely.  Among other places it vi&#8747;its the noble, and picture&#8747;que ruins of Cockermouth-ca&#8747;tle; under the walls of which it glides.</p>
<p>From hence it pa&#8747;&#8747;es to the &#8747;ea, which many &#8747;treams of greater con&#8747;equence never meet under their own names; but are ab&#8747;orbed by larger rivers: while the Derwent, after all the a&#8747;tonishing &#8747;cenes it has adorned, adds to it's other beauties, tho&#8747;e of an e&#8747;tuary.</p>
<p>In this la&#8747;t part of it's cour&#8747;e it vi&#8747;its Workington-hall, one of the grande&#8747;t and mo&#8747;t beautiful &#8747;ituations of the country.  Be&#8747;ides it's hanging woods, and &#8747;loping lawns, it is remarkable for having been the fir&#8747;t pri&#8747;on-hou&#8747;e of the unfortunate Mary of Scotland, after &#8747;he had landed within the dominions of her rival.  Here the Derwent becomes navigable; and forms the be&#8747;t natural harbour in Cumberland.</p>
<pb n="202"/>
<p>I have often thought, that if a per&#8747;on wi&#8747;hed particularly to amu&#8747;e him&#8747;elf with picture&#8747;que &#8747;cenes, the be&#8747;t method he could take, would be to placed before him a good map of England; and to &#8747;ettle in his head the cour&#8747;e of all the chief rivers of the country.  The&#8747;e rivers &#8747;hould be the great directing lines of his excur&#8747;ions.  On their banks he would be &#8747;ure, not only to find the mo&#8747;t beautiful views; but would al&#8747;o obtain a compleat &#8747;y&#8747;tem of every kind of land&#8747;cape.  He would have no occa&#8747;ion to keep &#8747;o clo&#8747;e to the river he pur&#8747;ued, as not to deviate a little, for the &#8747;ake of a beautiful &#8747;cene.  Ca&#8747;tles, and abbeys this plan would almo&#8747;t univer&#8747;ally comprehend; for mo&#8747;t of them are &#8747;eated either on rocks, or knolls projecting into rivers; or in &#8747;ome &#8747;weet valley which opens to them.  Bridges of cour&#8747;e it would include; which make a plea&#8747;ing &#8747;pecies of &#8747;cenery.  Mountains, and lakes I need not mention: the former produce rivers; and the latter are produced by them.  It would al&#8747;o include &#8747;ea-coa&#8747;t views; many of which are very intere&#8747;ting, when the e&#8747;tuary opens to
<pb n="203"/>
&#8747;ome beautiful, winding &#8747;hore, with views of di&#8747;tant country.</p>
<p>I once attempted to analyze the Thames in this way.  But I was obliged to divide &#8747;o magnificent a &#8747;ubject.  Indeed it naturally divided it&#8747;elf into three parts -- from Oxford to Wind&#8747;or -- from Wind&#8747;or to London -- from London to the &#8747;ea.  An imperial river, like the Thames, mu&#8747;t be navigated; at lea&#8747;t it's two lower divi&#8747;ions: but inferior rivers are be&#8747;t examined by an excur&#8747;ion along their banks.</p>
<p>We left the Derwent in it's declivious cour&#8747;e between two mountains.  One of them, under who&#8747;e &#8747;hadow the torrent pours, is called Eagle's-cragg; as it's tremendous rocks are the chief habitation of the&#8747;e birds; and &#8747;eem to be con&#8747;idered by them as a &#8747;ort of ca&#8747;tle, which from time immemorial they have po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ed.  It is a common &#8747;pecies of traffic in this country to &#8747;upply the curious with young eagles; in the taking of which the inhabitants are very expert.  They ob&#8747;erve the ne&#8747;ts from the bottom; and judging of the age of the young birds, they catch the opportunity,
<pb n="204"/>
when the old eagles are abroad, and let them&#8747;elves down by ropes from the &#8747;ummits of the cliffs.  We &#8747;aw one which had been ju&#8747;t taken.  It was only &#8747;ix weeks old; and was nearly of the &#8747;ize of a turkey-hen.  It &#8747;eemed to have acquired already a full &#8747;hare of ferocity; and &#8747;creamed violently, if we offered to touch it.</p>
<p>Many large birds we &#8747;aw among&#8747;t the&#8747;e mountains, &#8747;ailing about the air, which we imagine to be eagles: but one of our company, being a naturali&#8747;t, bad us ob&#8747;erve their tail feathers.  If their tails were forked, they were of the buzzard &#8747;pecies: the tail of the eagle is circular.</p>
<p>Among the anecdotes we heard in this country of eagles, one was rather curious -- An eagle was &#8747;een at a di&#8747;tance, to pounce on it's prey; which it carried, in a perpendicular a&#8747;cent, aloft into the air; and hanging dubious for &#8747;ome time, it was at length ob&#8747;erved to de&#8747;cend in the &#8747;ame direct line; and it's fall, as it approached, &#8747;eemed attended with an odd, tumbling motion.  The cau&#8747;e was &#8747;oon di&#8747;covered.  It fell &#8747;tone dead on the ground; and a wea&#8747;el, which it had carried up, and which had had the addre&#8747;s to
<pb n="205"/>
kill it's adver&#8747;ary in the air, being now at liberty, ran away.</p>
<p>We had accompanied the valley of Borrodale as far to the ea&#8747;t, as Eagle's-cragg.  It &#8747;tretches al&#8747;o to the we&#8747;t; tho in a more broken, and abrupt form.</p>
<p>Somewhat further, on this &#8747;ide, than Eagle's cragg lies on the other, ri&#8747;e tho&#8747;e mountains, where the celebrated black-lead mine is wrought.  I could not help feeling a friendly attachment to this place, which every lover of the pencil mu&#8747;t feel, as deriving from this mineral one of the be&#8747;t in&#8747;truments of his art; the free&#8747;t and readie&#8747;t expo&#8747;itor of his ideas.  We &#8747;aw the &#8747;ite of the mine at a di&#8747;tance, marked with a dingy yellow &#8747;tain, from the ochery mixtures thrown from it's mouth, which &#8747;hiver down the &#8747;ides of the mountain.</p>
<p>During the periodical &#8747;ea&#8747;on of working it, for it is opened only once in &#8747;even years, many people pick up a comfortable &#8747;ub&#8747;i&#8747;tence from the &#8747;craps of black-lead, which e&#8747;cape among&#8747;t the coar&#8747;er &#8747;trata.  The&#8747;e are hone&#8747;t gains.  But a late prolific genius in fraud took a very indirect method of po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ing a
<pb n="206"/>
&#8747;hare of this rich mineral.  A part of the mountain, contiguous to the mine, was his property.  Here, at the expence of great labour, he &#8747;ank a &#8747;haft, which he carried diagonally, till he entered the mine; where, with &#8747;ubterraneous wickedne&#8747;s, he continued his depredations for &#8747;ome time undi&#8747;covered.  At length his fraud was brought to light; and he was tried at Carli&#8747;le.  The peculiarity of his ca&#8747;e had no precedent.  He &#8747;aved his life; but a law was obtained by the proprietors of the mine, to defend their property from &#8747;uch indirect attacks for the future.</p>
<p>The &#8747;un was now declining, and it was too late to take a nearer view of the mine: nor indeed did it promi&#8747;e more on the &#8747;pot, than it di&#8747;covered at a di&#8747;tance.  Be&#8747;ides, the beauties of Watenlath had been &#8747;o &#8747;trongly repre&#8747;ented to us; that we were re&#8747;olved to go in que&#8747;t of tho&#8747;e &#8747;cenes, in preference to any other.</p>
<p>Watenlath is that tract of mountainous country (it&#8747;elf &#8747;urrounded by mountains &#8747;till higher) which coming boldly forward, breaks down abruptly from the &#8747;outh, upon the vale
<pb n="207"/>
of Ke&#8747;wick.  The &#8747;tream, which forms the fall of Lodoar, adorns fir&#8747;t the &#8747;cenes of Watenlath.</p>
<p>"Which way to Watenlath?" &#8747;aid ones of our company to a pea&#8747;ant, as we left the vale of Borrodale.  "That way," &#8747;aid he, pointing up a lofty mountain, &#8747;teeper than the tiling of a hou&#8747;e.</p>
<p>To tho&#8747;e, who are accu&#8747;tomed to mountains, the&#8747;e perpendicular motions may be amu&#8747;ing: but to us, who&#8747;e ideas were le&#8747;s elevated, they &#8747;eemed rather peculiar.  And yet there is &#8747;omething unmanly in conceiving a difficulty in traver&#8747;ing a path, which, we were told, the women of the country would a&#8747;cend on hor&#8747;eback, with their panniers of eggs, and butter, and return in the night.  To move upwards, keeping a &#8747;teady eye on the objects before us, was no great exerci&#8747;e to the brain: but it rather gave it a rotation to look back on what was pa&#8747;t -- an to &#8747;ee our companions below <i>clinging</i>, as it appeared, to the mountain's &#8747;ide; and the ri&#8747;ing brea&#8747;ts and bellies of their hor&#8747;es, &#8747;training up a path &#8747;o &#8747;teep, that it &#8747;eemed, as if the lea&#8747;t fal&#8747;e &#8747;tep would have carried them rolling many hundred yards to the bottom.</p>
<pb n="208"/>
<p>We had another apprehen&#8747;ion; that of mi&#8747;taking our way.  If a mi&#8747;t had &#8747;uddenly over&#8747;pread the mountain, which is a very common incident, we might have wandered all night: for we had not the precaution to take a guide.  The que&#8747;tion we a&#8747;ked of the pea&#8747;ant, at the bottom of the mountain; "Which <i>way</i> to Watenlath?" we found was a very improper one.  We &#8747;hould have a&#8747;ked, in what <i>direction</i> we were to &#8747;eek it?  For <i>way</i> there was none; except here and there a blind path; which being it&#8747;elf often bewildered, of cour&#8747;e, &#8747;erved only to bewilder us.  The inhabitants pay little attention to <i>paths:</i> they &#8747;teer along the&#8747;e wilds by <i>landmarks</i>, which to us were unknown.</p>
<p>At length however, after a painful perpendicular march of near two miles, and many a breathing pau&#8747;e, which our hor&#8747;es required, we gained the top.  Here we expected at lea&#8747;t to be rewarded by an amu&#8747;ing pro&#8747;pect over the neighbouring country.  But in this too we were di&#8747;appointed.  We found our&#8747;elves in the mid&#8747;t of a bog, with &#8747;till higher grounds around us: &#8747;o that after all our toil, we had a view only of a vile circum&#8747;cribed wa&#8747;te.</p>
<pb n="209"/>
<p>It was our bu&#8747;ine&#8747;s now to get out of this unplea&#8747;ant &#8747;cene, as &#8747;oon as we could, which was a matter of no great difficulty.  An ea&#8747;y, and &#8747;hort de&#8747;cent, on the other &#8747;ide of the mountain, brought us quickly to Watenlath.  Here our labours were amply rewarded.  We fell into a piece of &#8747;cenery, which for beauty, and grandeur, was equal, if not &#8747;uperior, to any thing we had yet &#8747;een.</p>
<p>The fir&#8747;t object we found was a &#8747;mall lake, about two miles in circumference, through which flows the Lodoar, and after a cour&#8747;e of three miles farther, forms that noble ca&#8747;cade, which we had &#8747;een, in the morning, at the head of Derwentwater.</p>
<p>The accompaniments of this river, from the lake of Watenlath to it's fall, make the &#8747;cenery, of which we came hither in que&#8747;t.</p>
<p>It is a valley &#8747;o contracted, that it affords room for little more than the river, and a path, at the bottom; while the mountains, on each &#8747;ide, are &#8747;o perpendicular, that their &#8747;ummits are &#8747;carce more a&#8747;under than their ba&#8747;es.  It was a new idea.  Many mountains we had &#8747;een hanging over the &#8747;ides of vallies:
<pb n="210"/>
but to be immured, through a &#8747;pace of almo&#8747;t three miles, within a cha&#8747;m of rifted rocks, (for that was in fact the idea pre&#8747;ented by the &#8747;cene before us,) was a novel circum&#8747;tance tho we had now been two or three days the inhabitants of mountains.</p>
<p>The form of this valley was very different from the valley of Borrodale.  The one led us through a winding rout: the other is nearly a vi&#8747;ta.  Each hath it's mode of grandeur.  The valley of Borrodale has more variety: but this is certainly the more maje&#8747;tic &#8747;cene.  The whole is only one va&#8747;t effort.  In point of immen&#8747;ity indeed it yields to the vi&#8747;ta at the entrance into Cumberland.  It is not &#8747;o va&#8747;t a <i>whole:</i> but being contracted within a &#8747;maller compa&#8747;s, we examine it's limits with more ea&#8747;e: and with regard to the grandeur and variety of the &#8747;everal <i>objects</i>, it lo&#8747;es nothing.  As we &#8747;tood <i>under</i> the beetling cliffs on each &#8747;ide, they were too near for in&#8747;pection: their har&#8747;h features wanted &#8747;oftening: but we had noble views of them all in order, both in <i>pro&#8747;pect</i>, and <i>retro&#8747;pect</i>.  Not only the de&#8747;ign, and compo&#8747;ition, but the very &#8747;trokes of nature's pencil might be traced through the whole &#8747;cene; every fractured rock, and every
<pb n="211"/>
hanging &#8747;hrub, which adorned it, was brought within the compa&#8747;s of the eye: each touch &#8747;o carele&#8747;s, and yet &#8747;o determined: &#8747;o wildly irregular; and yet all conducing to one whole.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the clo&#8747;e of the valley, the grandeur of the &#8747;cene increa&#8747;ed.  It opened into an amphitheatre, the area of which, like the valley, that led to it, was contracted; &#8747;carce containing the circumference of a mile: but the mountains, which invironed it, were grand and beautiful.</p>
<p>In mo&#8747;t of the &#8747;cenes we had pa&#8747;&#8747;ed, we were obliged to look for contra&#8747;t in the different modes of de&#8747;olation: but here barrenne&#8747;s was contra&#8747;ted with all the tints of vegetation.  The mountains in front, and on the left, were covered with wood, which mantled from the top to the bottom.  Tho&#8747;e on the right were barren; yet broken &#8747;o variou&#8747;ly, as even in them&#8747;elves to make a contra&#8747;t.  We admire the ruins of a Roman amphitheatre: but what are the mo&#8747;t magnificent of the works of art, compared with &#8747;uch an amphitheatre as this?  Were the Colo&#8747;&#8747;eum it&#8747;elf brought hither, and placed within this area, the grandeur of the idea would be lo&#8747;t;
<pb n="212"/>
and the ruin, magnificent as it is, would dwindle into the <i>ornament of a &#8747;cene</i>.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the amphitheatre, another bridge mountain-torrent joins the Lodaor from the ea&#8747;t, and forms it into a more con&#8747;iderable &#8747;tream.  With increa&#8747;ed velocity, (the ground growing every &#8747;tep more declivous) it now pours along with great rapidity; and throwing it&#8747;elf into the thicke&#8747;t of the woods, which clo&#8747;e the &#8747;cene, di&#8747;appears.  The imagination pur&#8747;ues it's progre&#8747;s.  It's roar is heard through the woods; and it is plain from the &#8747;ound, that it &#8747;uffers &#8747;ome great convul&#8747;ion.  But all is clo&#8747;e; impervious rocks and thickets intervene, and totally exclude the &#8747;ight.</p>
<p>We indeed had been behind the &#8747;cenes; and knew we were, at that in&#8747;tant, upon the &#8747;ummit of the fall of Lodaoar: but the imagination of a &#8747;tranger would be held in &#8747;timulating &#8747;u&#8747;pen&#8747;e.  The grandeur of the &#8747;ound would proclaim the dignity of the fall; and his eye would wi&#8747;h to participate of what his ear alone could inadequately judge.</p>
<p>Tho we had &#8747;een the fall of Lodoar from the bottom, we had a curio&#8747;ity to &#8747;ee how
<pb n="213"/>
it appeared from the top; and di&#8747;mounting, we contrived, by winding round the thickets, and clinging to the projections of the rocks, to get a dangerous peep down the aby&#8747;s.  There was nothing picture&#8747;que in the view, but &#8747;omething immen&#8747;ely grand.  We &#8747;tood now above tho&#8747;e two cheeks of the cha&#8747;m, through which the water forced it's way; and which in the morning, when &#8747;een from the bottom, appeared towering to a great height, and were the mo&#8747;t intere&#8747;ting parts of the view.  But amid&#8747;t the greatne&#8747;s of the objects, which now &#8747;urrounded them they were totally lo&#8747;t; appearing le&#8747;s than warts upon tho&#8747;e va&#8747;t limbs of nature, to which they adhered.</p>
<p>In our pa&#8747;&#8747;age through the valley of Watenlath, we met with many fragments of rocks, in which the &#8747;everal component &#8747;trata were very &#8747;trongly marked.  In &#8747;ome they could not have been more regularly formed by a rule and chi&#8747;&#8747;el: and in a few, (who&#8747;e &#8747;ofter lamina the weather had decayed,) as perfect cornices remained, as art could have produced.</p>
<pb n="214"/>
<p>Having taken a view of all this &#8747;cenery, and the evening beginning now to clo&#8747;e, we thought it time to put a &#8747;top to our curio&#8747;ity, and return to Ke&#8747;wick; from which we were about four miles di&#8747;tant.  In the morning we rode along the edge of the lake: but as we were now upon the higher grounds, we were obliged to make a compa&#8747;s round the mountains.</p>
<p>The&#8747;e de&#8747;olate grounds are very little inhabited.  We heard of a de&#8747;ign to introduce goats among them, with a view to make Ke&#8747;wick as celebrated for drinking goat's-whey, as &#8747;everal of the mountainous parts of Scotland.  In &#8747;ome places indeed, where there are valuable woods, the goat might be a pernicious inmate.  But in many places, as we rode, the bare and craggy &#8747;ides of hills &#8747;eemed capable of feeding nothing el&#8747;e.  Frequent little plots of herbage grow every where among the rocks, inaccessible to any other animal.  Even &#8747;heep on many of the&#8747;e &#8747;loping &#8747;helves could find no footing.  All this pa&#8747;turage
<pb n="215"/>
therefore is lo&#8747;t for want of goats to brouze it.</p>
<p>In a picture&#8747;que light, no ornament is more adapted to a mountainous, and rocky country, than the&#8747;e animals.  Their colours are beautiful, (in tho&#8747;e particularly of a darker hue) often playing into each other with great harmony.  But among the&#8747;e animals, (as among all others) the pied are the mo&#8747;t unplea&#8747;ing; in which oppo&#8747;ite colour come full upon each other, without any intervening tint.</p>
<p>The &#8747;haggine&#8747;s of the goat al&#8747;o is as beautiful, as the colours, which adorn him; his hair depending in that ea&#8747;y flow, which the pencil wi&#8747;hes to imitate.</p>
<p>His actions are &#8747;till more plea&#8747;ing.  It would add new terror to a &#8747;cene, to &#8747;ee an animal brouzing on the &#8747;teep of a perpendicular rock; or hanging on the very edge of a projecting precipice.  Virgil &#8747;eems to have looked at the&#8747;e attitudes of terror with delight:</p>

<p>IN our rout to Borrodale, we pa&#8747;&#8747;ed through the ea&#8747;tern, and &#8747;outhern parts of that mountainous country, which bounds the lake of Derwent: -- in our next expedition we propo&#8747;ed to view the we&#8747;tern.</p>
<p>From Ke&#8747;wick we mounted the hills on the north-we&#8747;t of the lake; and, on the other &#8747;ide, fell into the valley of Newlands, which we traver&#8747;ed from end to end.  It was a lovely &#8747;cene, totally different from the rude vallies we had yet met with.  The mountains, in general, on this &#8747;ide of the lake wear a &#8747;moother form, than tho&#8747;e either in the ea&#8747;t, or on the &#8747;outh.  Of this &#8747;moothne&#8747;s of feature in the <i>higher</i> grounds the <i>lower</i> participate.  The mountain vallies we had hitherto &#8747;een, were wild, rocky, and de&#8747;olate.  But here
<pb n="218"/>
the idea of terror was excluded.  The valley of Newlands was even adorned with beauties of luxuriant nature.  We travelled through groves, which were &#8747;ometimes open, and &#8747;ometimes clo&#8747;e; with a &#8747;parkling &#8747;tream, the common attendant of the&#8747;e vallies, accompanying us, through the whole &#8747;cene.</p>
<p>Having been amu&#8747;ed with this &#8747;weet &#8747;cenery about three miles, we entered another valley, or rather a mountain rece&#8747;s, called the valley of Ga&#8747;cadale.  I call it a rece&#8747;s, becau&#8747;e it is &#8747;oon terminated by a mountain running athwart, which denies any further pa&#8747;&#8747;age.  In&#8747;tead therefore of entering Ga&#8747;cadale, we were obliged to climb the hill, which forms one of it's &#8747;ides: and from the &#8747;ummit, we had a view not only of Ga&#8747;cadale, but of many other mountain rece&#8747;&#8747;es, all which participate more or le&#8747;s, of the &#8747;moothne&#8747;s of the high grounds in their neighbourhood.  Some of them were &#8747;cooped, and hollowed into very beautiful forms; in which woods alone was wanting.</p>
<p>The valley of Ga&#8747;cadale had nothing to recommend it, but novelty.  It was (a &#8747;cene
<pb n="219"/>
wholly new in this rugged country) a deep mountain rece&#8747;s, invironed on every &#8747;ide, except the entrance, by &#8747;mooth, &#8747;loping hills, which are adorned neither with wood, nor rock, nor broken ground; but &#8747;weep down from &#8747;ide to &#8747;ide, with the greate&#8747;t regularity.  We &#8747;carce remembered to have &#8747;een in any place, an operation of nature more completely formal.  At the head of this rece&#8747;s is a grand ca&#8747;cade.  We &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed it to be no great object of beauty, as it was probably void of all accompaniments: but it's poverty hid beneath a veil.  The clouds which were gathering upon the mountains, and &#8747;weeping along the vallies, began to intercept our view.  Every thing was wrapped in ob&#8747;curity.  When we &#8747;tood even on the &#8747;ummit of the ca&#8747;cade, we could only hear the torrent roar; but could not obtain the lea&#8747;t glimp&#8747;e of it, tho no object intervened.  The whole valley of Ga&#8747;cadale &#8747;moaked like a boiling caldron; and we got our ideas of it only by catches, as the volumes of clouds di&#8747;per&#8747;ed, at intervals, into purer air.</p>
<p>But what we lo&#8747;t in one re&#8747;pect by the gro&#8747;&#8747;ne&#8747;s of the atmo&#8747;phere, we gained in another.  Tho it is probable &#8747;ome views were
<pb n="220"/>
ob&#8747;cured, which might have plea&#8747;ed us; it is equally probable, that many of tho&#8747;e di&#8747;gu&#8747;ting features, with which we might have been pre&#8747;ented, were &#8747;oftened, and rendered more agreeable to the eye. -- Here indeed the mi&#8747;ty hue was, in general, laid on with too full a pencil.  The face of nature was rather blotted out, than ob&#8747;cured.  The whole view was in that &#8747;tate, which Thom&#8747;on &#8747;o well de&#8747;cribes:</p>
<poem>
	<line> ---- No more the mountain fills the eye</line>
	<line>With great variety; but in a night</line>
	<line>Of gathering vapour, from the baffled &#8747;en&#8747;e,</line>

	<line>The huge du&#8747;k gradual, &#8747;wallows up the plain.</line>
	<line>Vani&#8747;h the woods.  The dim &#8747;een river &#8747;eems</line>
	<line>Sullen and &#8747;low to rowl the mi&#8747;ty wave.</line>
</poem>
<p>Among the beautiful appearances of fogs, and mi&#8747;ts, their <i>gradually going off</i> may be ob&#8747;erved.  A land&#8747;cape takes a variety of plea&#8747;ing hues, as it pa&#8747;&#8747;es, in a retiring fog, through the different modes of ob&#8747;curity into full &#8747;plendor.</p>
<pb n="221"/>
<p>There is great beauty al&#8747;o in a fog's <i>partially clearing up at once</i>, as it often does; and pre&#8747;enting &#8747;ome di&#8747;tant piece of land&#8747;cape under great radiance; when all the &#8747;urrounding parts are &#8747;till in ob&#8747;curity.  The curtain is not intirely drawn up; it is only ju&#8747;t rai&#8747;ed, to let in &#8747;ome beautiful, tran&#8747;ient view; and perhaps falling again, while we admire, leaves us that ardent reli&#8747;h, which we have for plea&#8747;ing objects &#8747;uddenly removed. -- Some very beautiful ideas of this kind were di&#8747;played on the &#8747;ummits of Ga&#8747;cadale.  Tho the mountains around us, and the contracted vallies in our neighbourhood, were all &#8747;o much ab&#8747;orbed in the dark atmo&#8747;phere of clouds and vapours; we could di&#8747;cover, in catches, through their thinner &#8747;kirts, the vale of Ke&#8747;wick, at a di&#8747;tance, over&#8747;pread with &#8747;erenity and &#8747;un-&#8747;hine.</p>
<p>The mountain, over which we pa&#8747;&#8747;ed, is called, in the language of the country, a <i>haw&#8747;e</i>, or &#8747;toppage, in pa&#8747;&#8747;in from one di&#8747;trict to another; the valley being clo&#8747;ed, and no other way left.  This <i>haw&#8747;e</i>, tho not &#8747;o &#8747;teep as the mountain, which led us to Watenlath,
<pb n="222"/>
was of much longer continuance; and in &#8747;ome parts carried us very near the edges of precipices: but &#8747;urrounded by fogs, we kept the path before us; and if there was danger, we &#8747;eldom &#8747;aw it.</p>
<p>As we began to de&#8747;cend, we breather a purer air; and got a &#8747;ight of the land&#8747;cape before us.  It was a &#8747;cene, unlike what we had ju&#8747;t pa&#8747;&#8747;ed; but only, as the botani&#8747;t &#8747;peaks, a variety of the &#8747;ame genus; corre&#8747;ponding intirely with the character of the country, which we now traver&#8747;ed.  Three broad mountains, &#8747;loping into each other, formed a tripartite valley, centering in one point.  The &#8747;urface of each mountain was &#8747;mooth to it's very &#8747;ummit; except that, here and there, a few large &#8747;tones lay &#8747;cattered about: &#8747;ome of them fixed in the &#8747;oil; but none of them de&#8747;erving the appellation of a rock.  Through two of the divi&#8747;ions of this valley ran different &#8747;treams; each of them as unfringed, and &#8747;imple, as the mountains they &#8747;evered.  The&#8747;e &#8747;treams uniting in the centre, formed a third.  The whole was a peculiar and novel &#8747;cene; but neither intere&#8747;ting, nor picture&#8747;que.</p>
<pb n="223"/>
<p>The&#8747;e &#8747;mooth-coated mountains, tho of little e&#8747;timation in the painter's eye, are however great &#8747;ources of plenty.  They are the nur&#8747;eries of &#8747;heep; which are bred here, and fatted in the vallies.</p>
<p>But the life of a &#8747;hepherd, in this country, is not an Arcadian life.  His occupation &#8747;ubjects him to many difficulties, in the winter e&#8747;pecially, when he is often obliged to attend his flock on the bleak &#8747;ide of a mountain, which engages him in many a painful vigil.  An when the mountains are covered with &#8747;now, which is frequently the ca&#8747;e, his employment becomes then a dangerous one.  It &#8747;eldom happens, but that &#8747;ome part of his flock is &#8747;nowed up; and pre&#8747;erving their lives, he mu&#8747;t often expo&#8747;e his own.</p>
<p>After winding about two miles along the edge of one of the&#8747;e mountains, we dropped at once into a beautiful vale, called the vale of Butermer, the bottom of which was adorned by a lake of the &#8747;ame name.</p>
<pb n="224"/>
<p>This lake is &#8747;mall; about a mile and a half in length, and half a mile in breadth; of an oblong form; &#8747;weeping, at one end, round a woody promontory.  But this &#8747;weep is rather forced; and from &#8747;ome points makes too acute an angle.  It is one of tho&#8747;e lines, which would have a better effect from a boat<ptr target="n11"/>.  A lower point would &#8747;often it's abruptne&#8747;s.  In other parts al&#8747;o the lines of this lake are rather too &#8747;quare.  The &#8747;cenery however about it is grand, and beautiful.</p>
<note id="n11">See page 96.</note>
<p>On the we&#8747;tern &#8747;ide, a long range of mountainous declivity extends from end to end; falling every where precipitately into the water, at lea&#8747;t it had that appearance to the eye: tho on the &#8747;pot probably a margin of meadow might &#8747;hoot from the bottom of the mountain, as we ob&#8747;erved at Ke&#8747;wick.  Of the line, which the &#8747;ummit of this mountain formed, we could not ea&#8747;ily judge; as it was in a great mea&#8747;ure hid in clouds.</p>
<p>The ea&#8747;tern &#8747;ide of the lake is woody; and contra&#8747;ts happily with the we&#8747;tern.  But the wood is of that kind, which is periodically
<pb n="225"/>
cut down, and was not in perfection, when we &#8747;aw it.</p>
<p>Near the bottom of this lake, is the loftie&#8747;t ca&#8747;cade we had ever &#8747;een.  It hardly, I think, falls through a le&#8747;s de&#8747;cent than three or four hundred yards.  But it is an object of no beauty; it is barren of accompaniments; and appears, at a di&#8747;tance, like a white ribbon bi&#8747;ecting the mountain.  The people of the country, alluding to the whitene&#8747;s of it's foam, call it <i>&#8747;our-milk-force</i>.</p>
<p>The vale of Butermer is rather confined in that part, which the lake occupies.  Below, it extends a con&#8747;iderable way: but our rout led us fir&#8747;t above, in que&#8747;t of &#8747;ome rocky mountains, which are &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed to be the highe&#8747;t precipices in the country.  The&#8747;e &#8747;cenes, which are known by the name of <i>Gate&#8747;garth-dale</i>, open at the head of the lake.</p>
<p>Here we found two vallies, formed by a mountain on each &#8747;ide, and one in the middle.  The right hand valley was &#8747;oon clo&#8747;ed by a <i>haw&#8747;e:</i> that on the left led directly to the &#8747;cenes we &#8747;ought.</p>
<p>The tran&#8747;ition here, contrary to the u&#8747;ual proce&#8747;s of nature, is abrupt.  We had been travelling, all the morning, among mountains
<pb n="226"/>
perfectly &#8747;mooth, and covered with herbage; and now found our&#8747;elves &#8747;uddenly among craggs and rocks, and precipices, as wild, and hideous, as any we had &#8747;een.</p>
<p><i>Gate&#8747;garth-dale</i>, into which we &#8747;oon entered, is indeed a very tremendous &#8747;cene.  Like all the vallies we had yet found, it had a peculiar character.  It's features were it's own.  It was not a vi&#8747;ta like the valley of Watenlath; nor had it any of the &#8747;udden turns of the valley of Borrodale: but would &#8747;lowly, and &#8747;olemnly in one large segment.  It was a wider al&#8747;o than either of tho&#8747;e vallies; being at lea&#8747;t half a quarter of a miles from &#8747;ide to &#8747;ide; which di&#8747;tance it pretty uniformly ob&#8747;erved; the rocky mountains, which invironed it, keeping their line with great exactne&#8747;s; at lea&#8747;t, never breaking out into any violent projections.</p>
<p>The area of this valley is, in general, concave; the &#8747;ides almo&#8747;t perpendicular, compo&#8747;ed of a kind of broken craggy rock, the ruins of which every where &#8747;trew the valley; and five it &#8747;till more the idea of de&#8747;olation.</p>
<pb n="226.1"/>
<gap desc="unclear landscape orientated oval picture"/>
<pb n="227"/>
<p>The river al&#8747;o, which runs through it, and is the principal &#8747;upply of the lake, is as wild as the valley it&#8747;elf.  It has no banks, but the fragments of rocks; no bed, but a channel compo&#8747;ed of rocky &#8747;trata, among which the water forces it's cour&#8747;e.  It's channel, as well as it's bank, is formed of loo&#8747;e &#8747;tones, and fragments, which break, and divide the &#8747;tream into a &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ion of wild, impetuous eddies.</p>
<p>A &#8747;tream , which is the natural &#8747;ource of plenty, is perhaps when unaccompanied with verdure, the &#8747;tronge&#8747;t emblem of de&#8747;olations.  It &#8747;hews the &#8747;pot to be &#8747;o barren, that even the greate&#8747;t &#8747;ource of abundance can produce nothing.  The whole valley indeed joined in impre&#8747;&#8747;ing the &#8747;ame idea.  Fruitful nature, making in every part of her ample range, unremitting efforts to vegetate, could not here produce a &#8747;ingle germin.</p>
<p>As we proceeded, the grandeur of the valley increa&#8747;ed.  We had been prepared indeed to &#8747;ee the highe&#8747;t precipices, which the country produced.  Such a preface is generally productive of di&#8747;appointment; but on this occa&#8747;ion it did no injury.  The fancy had &#8747;till it's &#8747;cope.  We found the mountains &#8747;o over-hung with
<pb n="227.1"/>
<gap desc="unclear landscape orientated oval picture"/>
<pb n="228"/>
clouds, that we could form little judgment of their height.  Our guide told us, they were twice as high, as we could &#8747;ee: which however we did not believe from the ob&#8747;ervations we were able to make, as the clouds, at intervals, floated pa&#8747;t; and di&#8747;covered, here and there, the &#8747;hadowy forms of the rocky &#8747;ummits.  A great height however they certaily were; and the darkne&#8747;s, in which they were wrapped, gave us a new illu&#8747;tration of the grandeur of tho&#8747;e ideas, which ari&#8747;e from ob&#8747;curity.  "Dark, confu&#8747;ed, uncertain images, Mr. Burk very ju&#8747;tly ob&#8747;erves, have a greater power on the fancy to form the grander pa&#8747;&#8747;ions, than tho&#8747;e, which are more clear, and determinate.  For hardly any thing can &#8747;trike the mind with it's greatne&#8747;s, which does not make &#8747;ome &#8747;ort of approach towards infinity; which nothing can do, whil&#8747;t we are able to perceive it's bounds, is one, and the &#8747;ame thing.  A clear idea therefore is another name for a little idea<ptr target="n12"/>."</p>

<pb n="229"/>
<p>The middles of the valley is adorned, as the&#8747;e vallies, in &#8747;ome part, often are, by a craggy hill; on the top of which &#8747;tands the fragment of a rock; that looks, in O&#8747;&#8747;ian's language, like the <i>&#8747;tone of power</i> -- the rude deity of de&#8747;olation, to which the &#8747;cene is &#8747;acred.</p>
<p>This valley is not more than &#8747;ix miles from the black-lead mines; and would have led us to them, if we had pur&#8747;ued it's cour&#8747;e.</p>
<p>Having travelled about three miles in this dreary &#8747;cene; and having take &#8747;uch a view, as we could obtain, of the bold inclo&#8747;ures, which contained it; we returned by the &#8747;ame rout we came, threading the valley, and &#8747;kirting the lake along it's ea&#8747;tern coa&#8747;t, till we arrived at the bottom of it.  Here we fell into a country very different from that we had left.</p>
<p>The vale of Butermer, which extends many miles below the lake, is a wide, variegated &#8747;cene, full of ri&#8747;ing and falling ground; woody
<pb n="230"/>
in many parts; well inhabited in &#8747;ome; fruitful, and luxuriant in all.</p>
<p>Here we found a village, where we made a luxurious repa&#8747;t, as u&#8747;ual, on eggs and milk; and met, in the chearful and health looks of the inhabitants, new proofs of the narrow limits, in which all the real wants of life are comprized.</p>

The two lakes bear a great re&#8747;emblance to each other.  Both are oblong: both wind
<pb n="2"/>
round promontories; and both are &#8747;urrounded by mountains.  But the lower lake is near a mile longer, than the upper; the lines it forms are much ea&#8747;ier; and tho it has le&#8747;s wood on it's banks, the lo&#8747;s is compen&#8747;ated by a richer di&#8747;play of rocky &#8747;cenery.  The forms of the&#8747;e rocks are in general, beautiful; mo&#8747;t of them being broken into a grand &#8747;quare &#8747;urfaces.  This &#8747;pecies, as we have already ob&#8747;erved<ptr target="n13"/>, are in a greater &#8747;tyle, than the cragg, which is &#8747;hattered into more diminutive parts.</p>
<note id="n13">See Page, 108.</note>
<p>With this rocky &#8747;cenery much hilly ground is intermixed.  Patches of meadow al&#8747;o, here and there, on the banks of the lake, improve the variety.  Nothing is wanting but a little more wood, to make this lake, and the vale in which it lies, a very inchanting &#8747;cene: or rather a &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ion of inchanting &#8747;cenes: for the hills and ri&#8747;ing grounds, into which it every where &#8747;wells, acting in due &#8747;ubordination to the grand mountains, which inviron the whole vale, break and &#8747;eparate the area of it into &#8747;maller parts.  Many of the&#8747;e form
<pb n="3"/>
them&#8747;elves into little vallies, and other rece&#8747;&#8747;es, which are very picture&#8747;que.</p>
<p>Not far from the lake the mountain of Gra&#8747;mer appears ri&#8747;ing above all the mountains in it's neighbourhood.  A lake of this name we had already &#8747;een in our road between Amble&#8747;ide, and Ke&#8747;wick; but there is no connection between the lake, and the mountain.</p>
<p>This mountain forms rather a va&#8747;t ridge, than a pointed &#8747;ummit: and is connected with two or three other mountains of inferior dignity: it&#8747;elf is &#8747;aid to be equal to Skiddaw; which is the common gage of altitude through the whole country; and therefore may be &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed the highe&#8747;t.  No mountain a&#8747;pires to be higher than Skiddaw: &#8747;ome boa&#8747;t an equal height: but two or three only have real preten&#8747;ions.</p>
<p>Gra&#8747;mer, and the mountains in it's neighbourhood, form the ea&#8747;tern boundary of the vale, which we now traver&#8747;ed; a vale at lea&#8747;t five miles in length, and one third of that &#8747;pace in breadth.  Our road carried us near
<pb n="4"/>
the village of Brackenthwait, which lies at the bottom of Gra&#8747;mer.</p>
<p>Here we had an account of an inundatation occa&#8747;ioned by the bur&#8747;ting of a water-&#8747;pout.  The particulars, which are well authenticated, are curious.  But it will be nece&#8747;&#8747;ary fir&#8747;t to exhibit the geography of the mountain.</p>
<p>In that part, where Gra&#8747;mer is connected with the other high lands in it's neighbourhood, three little &#8747;treams take their origin; of which the Li&#8747;&#8747;a is the lea&#8747;t incon&#8747;iderable.  The cour&#8747;e of this &#8747;tream down the mountain is very &#8747;teep, and about a mile in length.  It's bed, which is a deep <i>gully</i>, and the &#8747;ides of the mountain all around, are profu&#8747;ely &#8747;pread with loo&#8747;e &#8747;tones, and gravel.  On leaving the mountain, the Li&#8747;&#8747;a divides the vale, through which we now pa&#8747;&#8747;ed; and, after a cour&#8747;e of four or five miles, joins the Cocker.</p>
<p>On the 9th of September 1760, about midnight, the water-&#8747;pout fell upon Gra&#8747;mer, nearly, as was conjectured, where the three little &#8747;treams, ju&#8747;t mentioned, i&#8747;&#8747;ue from their fountains.</p>
<pb n="5"/>
<p>At fir&#8747;t it &#8747;wept the whole &#8747;ide of the mountain, and charging it&#8747;elf with all the rubbi&#8747;h it found there, made it's way into the vale, following chiefly the direction of the Li&#8747;&#8747;a.  At the foot of the mountain it was received by a piece of arable ground; on which it's violence fir&#8747;t broke.  Here it tore away trees, &#8747;oil, and gravel; and laid all bare, many feet in depth, to the naked rock.  Over the next ten acres it &#8747;eems to have made an immen&#8747;e roll; covering them with &#8747;o va&#8747;t a bed of &#8747;tones; that no human art can every again re&#8747;tore the &#8747;oil</p>
<p>When we &#8747;aw the placed, tho twelve years after the even, many marks remained, &#8747;till flagrant, of this &#8747;cene of ruin.  We &#8747;aw the natural bed of the Li&#8747;&#8747;a, a mere contracted rivulet; and on it's banks the ve&#8747;tiges of a &#8747;tony channel, &#8747;preading far and wide, almo&#8747;t enough to contain the waters of the Rhine, or the Danube.  It was computed from the flood-marks, that in many parts the &#8747;tream mu&#8747;t have been five or &#8747;ix yards deep; and near a hundred broad; and if it's great velocity be added to this weight of water, it's moment will be found equal to almo&#8747;t any effect.</p>
<pb n="6"/>
<p>On the banks of this &#8747;tony channel, we &#8747;aw a few &#8747;cattered hou&#8747;es, a part of the village of Brackenthwait, which had a wonderful e&#8747;cape.  They &#8747;tood at the bottom of Gra&#8747;mer, rather on a ri&#8747;ing ground; and the current, taking it's fir&#8747;t direction towards them, would have undermined them in a few moments, (for the &#8747;oil was in&#8747;tantly laid bare) had not a projection of native rock, the interior &#8747;tratum, on which the hou&#8747;es had unknowingly been founded, re&#8747;i&#8747;ted the current, and given it a new direction.  Unle&#8747;s this had intervened, it is probable, the&#8747;e hou&#8747;es, and all the inhabitants of them (&#8747;o in&#8747;tantaneous was the ruin) had been &#8747;wept away together.</p>
<p>In pa&#8747;&#8747;ing farther along the vale, we &#8747;aw other marks of the fury of the inundation; where, bridges had been thrown down, hou&#8747;es carried off, and woods rooted up.  But it's effects upon a &#8747;tone-cau&#8747;eway were thought the mo&#8747;t &#8747;urprizing.  This fabric was of great thickne&#8747;s; and &#8747;upported, on each &#8747;ide, by an enormous bank of earth.  The memory of man could trace it, unaltered in any particular, near a hundred years: but by the &#8747;oundne&#8747;s and firmne&#8747;s of it's parts and texture, it &#8747;eemed
<pb n="7"/>
as if it had &#8747;tood for ages.  It was almo&#8747;t a doubt, whether it were a work of nature, or of art.  This ma&#8747;&#8747;y mole the deluge not only carried off; but, as if it turned it into &#8747;port, made it's very foundations the channel of it's own &#8747;tream.</p>
<p>Having done all this mi&#8747;chief, not only here, but in many other parts, the Li&#8747;&#8747;a threw all it's waters into the Cocker, where an end was put to it's deva&#8747;tation: for tho the Cocker was unable to contain &#8747;o immen&#8747;e an increa&#8747;e; yet as it flows through a more level country, the deluge &#8747;pread far and wide, and wa&#8747;ted it's &#8747;trength in one va&#8747;t, &#8747;tagnant inundation.</p>
<p>Having pa&#8747;&#8747;ed through the vale of Butermer, we entered another beautiful &#8747;cene, the vale of Lorton.</p>
<p>This vale, like all the pa&#8747;t, pre&#8747;ents us with a &#8747;cene intirely new.  No lakes, no rocks are here, to blend the idea of dignity, and grandeur with that of beauty.  All is &#8747;implicity, and repo&#8747;e.  Nature, in this &#8747;cene, lays totally a&#8747;ide her maje&#8747;tic frown, and wears only a lovely &#8747;mile.</p>
<pb n="8"/>
<p>The vale of Lorton is of the extended kind, running a con&#8747;iderable way between mountains, which range at about a mile's di&#8747;tance.  They are near enough to &#8747;creen it from the &#8747;torm; and yet not &#8747;o impending as to exclude the &#8747;un.  Their &#8747;ides, tho not &#8747;mooth, are not much diver&#8747;ified.  A few knolls and hollows ju&#8747;t give a little variety to the broad lights and &#8747;hades, which over-&#8747;pread them.</p>
<p>This vale, which enjoys a rich &#8747;oil, is in general a rural, cultivated &#8747;cene; tho in many parts the ground is beautifully broken, and abrupt.  A bright &#8747;tream, which might almo&#8747;t take the name of a river, pours along a rocky channel; and &#8747;parkles down numberle&#8747;s little ca&#8747;cades.  It's banks are adorned with wood; and varied with different objects; a bridge; a mill; a hamlet; a glade over-hung with wood; or &#8747;ome little &#8747;weet rece&#8747;s; or natural vi&#8747;ta, through which the eye ranges, between irregular trees, along the windings of the &#8747;tream.</p>
<p>Except the mountains, nothing in all this &#8747;cenery is <i>great</i>; but every part is filled with tho&#8747;e &#8747;weet engaging pa&#8747;&#8747;ages of nature, which
<pb n="9"/>
tend to &#8747;ooth the mind, and in&#8747;till tranquility.</p>

<p>Scenes of this kind, (however plea&#8747;ing) in which few objects occur, either of <i>grandeur</i> or <i>peculiarity</i>, in a &#8747;ingular manner elude the powers of verbal de&#8747;cription.  They almo&#8747;t elude the power of colours.  The &#8747;oft and elegant form of beauty is hard to hit: while the &#8747;trong, har&#8747;h feature is a mark, which every pencil can &#8747;trike.</p>
<p>But tho a <i>peculiar</i> difficulty attends the verbal de&#8747;cription of the&#8747;e mild, and quiet haunts of nature; yet undoubtedly <i>all</i> her &#8747;cenery is ill-attempted in language.</p>
<p>Mountains, rocks, broken ground, water, and wood, are the &#8747;imple materials, which &#8747;he employs in all her beautiful pictures: but the variety and harmony, with which &#8747;he employs them, are infinite.  In de&#8747;cription the&#8747;e words &#8747;tand only for general ideas: on her charts each is detailed into a thou&#8747;and
<pb n="10"/>
varied forms.  Words may give the great outlines of a &#8747;cene.  They can mea&#8747;ure the dimen&#8747;ions of a lake.  They can hang it's &#8747;ides with wood.  They can rear a ca&#8747;tle on &#8747;ome projecting rock: or place an i&#8747;land near this, or the other &#8747;hore.  But their range extends no farther.  They cannot mark the characteri&#8747;tic di&#8747;tinctions of each &#8747;cene -- the touches of nature -- her living tints -- her endle&#8747;s varieties, both in form and colour. -- In a word, all her elegant peculiarities are beyond their reach.  Language is equally unable to convey the&#8747;e to the eye; as the eye is to convey the various divi&#8747;ions of &#8747;ound to the ear.</p>
<p>The pencil, it is true, offers a more perfect mode of de&#8747;cription.  It &#8747;peaks a language more intelligible; and de&#8747;cribes the &#8747;cene in &#8747;tronger, and more varied terms.  The &#8747;hapes, and hues of objects it delineates, and marks, with more exactne&#8747;s.  It gives the lake the louring &#8747;hade of tempe&#8747;t; or the glowing blu&#8747;h of &#8747;un-&#8747;et.  It &#8747;preads a warmer, or a colder tint on the tufts of the fore&#8747;t.  It adds form to the ca&#8747;tle; and tips it's &#8747;hattered battlements with light. -- But all this, all that words can expre&#8747;s, or even the pencil de&#8747;cribe,
<pb n="11"/>
are gro&#8747;s, in&#8747;ipid &#8747;ub&#8747;titutes of the living &#8747;cene<ptr target="n14"/>.  We may be plea&#8747;ed with the de&#8747;cription, and the picture: but the &#8747;oul can <i>feel</i> neither, unle&#8747;s the force of our own imagination aid the poet's, or the painter's art; exalt the idea; and <i>picture things un&#8747;een</i>.</p>
<p>Hence it perhaps follows, that the perfection of the art of painting is not &#8747;o much attained by an endeavour to form an exact re&#8747;emblance of nature in a <i>nice repre&#8747;entation of all her minute parts</i>, which we con&#8747;ider as almo&#8747;t impracticable, ending generally in flatne&#8747;s, and in&#8747;ipidity; as by aiming to give tho&#8747;e bold, tho&#8747;e &#8747;trong characteri&#8747;tic touches, which excite the imagination; and lead it to form half the picture, it&#8747;elf.  Painting is the <i>art of deceiving</i>; and it's great perfection lies in the exerci&#8747;e of this art.</p>
<note id="n14">This is not at all incon&#8747;i&#8747;tent with what is &#8747;aid in the 119th page.  <i>Here</i> we &#8747;peak chiefly of the <i>detail</i> of nature's works: <i>there</i> of the <i>compo&#8747;ition</i>.  The nearer we approach the character of nature in every mode of imitation, no doubt the better: yet &#8747;till there are many irregularities and deformities in the natural &#8747;cene, which we may wi&#8747;h to correct -- that is, to correct, by improving one part of nature by another.</note>
<p>Hence it is that genius, and knowledge are as requi&#8747;ite in &#8747;urveying a picture, as in
<pb n="12"/>
painting one.  The cold, untutored eye, (tho it may enjoy the <i>real</i> &#8747;cene, (be it hi&#8747;tory,<ptr target="n15"/> land&#8747;cape, or what it will) is unmoved at the fine&#8747;t <i>repre&#8747;entation</i>.  It does not &#8747;ee an <i>exact</i> re&#8747;emblance of what it &#8747;ees abroad; and having not internal pencil, if I may &#8747;o &#8747;peak, to work within; it is utterly unable to <i>admini&#8747;ter</i> a picture to it&#8747;elf.  Whereas the learned eye<ptr target="n16"/>, ver&#8747;ed equally in nature, and

<pb n="13"/>
art, ea&#8747;ily compares the picture with it's archetype: and when it finds the characteristic touches of nature, the imagination immediately takes fire; and glows with a thou&#8747;and beautiful ideas, &#8747;ugge&#8747;ted only by the canvas.  When the canvas therefore is &#8747;o artificially wrought, as to &#8747;ugge&#8747;t the&#8747;e ideas in the &#8747;tronge&#8747;t manner, the picture is then mo&#8747;t perfect.  This is generally be&#8747;t done by little
<pb n="14"/>
labour, and great knowledge.  It is knowledge only, which in&#8747;pires that free, that fearle&#8747;s, and determined pencil, &#8747;o expre&#8747;&#8747;ive in a &#8747;kilful hand.  As to the <i>minuti&#230;</i> of nature, the picture&#8747;que eye will generally &#8747;ugge&#8747;t them better it&#8747;elf; and yet give the arti&#8747;t, as he de&#8747;erves, the credit of the whole.</p>
<note id="n15">Hi&#8747;tory-painting is certainly the mo&#8747;t elevated &#8747;pecies.  Nothing exalts the human mind &#8747;o much, as to &#8747;ee the great actions of our fellow-creatures brought before the eye.  But this plea&#8747;ure we &#8747;eldom find in painting.  So ,much is required from the hi&#8747;tory-painter, &#8747;o intimate a knowledge both of nature and art, that we rarely &#8747;ee a hi&#8747;tory-piece, even from the be&#8747;t ma&#8747;ters, that is able to <i>rai&#8747;e raptures</i>.  We may admire the colouring, or the execution; or &#8747;ome under-part; but the <i>&#8747;oul is &#8747;eldom reached</i>.  The imagination &#8747;oars beyond the picture.  In the inferior walks of painting, where le&#8747;s is required, more of cour&#8747;e is performed: and tho we have few good pictures in hi&#8747;tory, we have many in portrait, in land&#8747;cape, in animal-life, dead-game, fruit, and flowers.  Hi&#8747;tory painting is a mode of epic; and tho the literary world abounds with admirable production in the lower walks of poetry, an epic is the wonder of an age.</note>
<note id="n16"><p>The admirers of painting may be divided into two cla&#8747;&#8747;es: -- The inferior admirer values him&#8747;elf on <i>di&#8747;tingui&#8747;hing the ma&#8747;ter</i> -- on knowing the peculiar touch of each pencil; and the ruling tint of every pallet.  But he has no <i>feeling</i>.  If the picture be an <i>original</i>, or if it be in the ma&#8747;ter's <i>be&#8747;t manner</i> (which may be the ca&#8747;e of many a bad picture) it is the object of his veneration; tho the &#8747;tory be ill-told, the characters feebly marked, and a total deficiency appear in every excellence of the art.</p>
<p>The more liberal profe&#8747;&#8747;or, (and who alone is here con&#8747;idered as capable of <i>admini&#8747;tring</i> a picture to him&#8747;elf) thinks the knowledge of names, (any further than as it marks excellence, till we get a better criterion,) is the bane of the art he admires.  A work, worthy of admiration, may be produced by an inferior hand; and a paltry compo&#8747;ition may e&#8747;cape from a ma&#8747;ter.  He would have the <i>intrin&#8747;ic merit</i> of a work, not any <i>arbitrary &#8747;tamp</i> proclaim it's excellence.  In examining a picture, he leaves the <i>name</i> entirely out of the que&#8747;tion.  It may mi&#8747;lead, it cannot a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;t, his judgment.  The characters of nature, and the knowledge of art, are all he looks for: the re&#8747;t, be they Guido's, Carrache's, or Raphael's, he de&#8747;pi&#8747;es as the bubbles of picture-dealers; the mere &#8747;weepings, and refu&#8747;e of Italian garrets.</p></note>
<p>We &#8747;ometimes indeed &#8747;ee pictures <i>highly fini&#8747;hed</i>, and <i>yet full of &#8747;pirit</i>.  They will bear a nice examination at hand, and yet lo&#8747;e nothing of their di&#8747;tant effect.  But &#8747;uch pictures are &#8747;o exceedingly rare, that I &#8747;hould think, few painters would in prudence attempt a laboured manner.  Indeed, as pictures are not de&#8747;igned to be &#8747;een through a micro&#8747;cope, but at a proper di&#8747;tance, it is labour thrown away<ptr target="n17"/>.</p>
<note id="n17">In the higher walks of painting I know of no arti&#8747;t, who does not lo&#8747;e his &#8747;pirit in attempting to fini&#8747;h highly.  In the inferior walks we have a few.  Among the fir&#8747;t we may rank Van Huy&#8747;um, who painted flowers, and fruits, with equal labour and &#8747;pirit.  And yet even here, I own I have more plea&#8747;ure in helping my&#8747;elf to the&#8747;e delicacies from the bolder works of Bapti&#8747;te.</note>
<p>Hence it is that even a rough &#8747;ketch, by the hand of a ma&#8747;ter, will often &#8747;trike the imagination beyond the mo&#8747;t fini&#8747;hed work.
<pb n="15"/>
I have &#8747;een the learned eye pa&#8747;s unmoved along rows of pictures by the cold, and inanimate pencil of &#8747;uch a ma&#8747;ter as Carlo Marat; and &#8747;tart a&#8747;toni&#8747;hed, when it came to a &#8747;ketch of Rubens.  In one ca&#8747;e the painter endeavouring in vain to admini&#8747;ter every thing by giving the full roundne&#8747;s, and &#8747;moothne&#8747;s to every part, in&#8747;tead of the bold, characteri&#8747;tic touches of nature, had done too much: in the other, tho the work was left unfini&#8747;hed, yet many of the bold characteri&#8747;tic touches being thrown in, enough was done to excite the imagination of the &#8747;pectator, which could ea&#8747;ily &#8747;upply the re&#8747;t.</p>
<p>A very ingenious writer <ptr target="n18"/> indeed gives another rea&#8747;on for our being better plea&#8747;ed with a &#8747;ketch, than with a fini&#8747;hed piece.  <i>The imagination</i>, &#8747;ays he, <i>is entertained with the promi&#8747;e of &#8747;omething more</i>; <i>and does not acquie&#8747;ce in the pre&#8747;ent object of the &#8747;en&#8747;e</i>.  But this ob&#8747;ervation, I think is &#8747;carce founded on truth.  It is true <i>the imagination does not acquie&#8747;ce in the pre&#8747;ent object of the &#8747;en&#8747;e:</i> but, I &#8747;hould &#8747;uppo&#8747;e, not becau&#8747;e it is entertained with a <i>promi&#8747;e of &#8747;omething more</i>; but becau&#8747;e it has the power, of <i>creating &#8747;omething more it&#8747;elf</i>.  If <i>a promi&#8747;e of &#8747;omething more</i>, were the cau&#8747;e of this plea&#8747;ure, it &#8747;hould &#8747;eem, that a &#8747;ketch, in it's rude&#8747;t form, would be more plea&#8747;ing, than when it is more advanced: for the imagination mu&#8747;t have &#8747;till <i>higher</i> entertainment in proportion to the <i>largene&#8747;s</i> of the promi&#8747;e.  But this is not the ca&#8747;e.  The &#8747;ketch, in it's naked chalk-lines, affects us little in compari&#8747;on.  The in&#8747;trument mu&#8747;t be turned higher, to excite vibrations in the imagination.</p>

<p>Again, on the &#8747;ame &#8747;uppo&#8747;ition, one would imagine, that the rude beginning, or rough plan of a hou&#8747;e, would plea&#8747;e us more than the compleat pile; for <i>the imagination is entertained with the promi&#8747;e of &#8747;omething more</i>.  But, I believe, no one was ever &#8747;o well plea&#8747;ed with an unfini&#8747;hed &#8747;hell, amid&#8747;t all it's rubbi&#8747;h of &#8747;caffolding, paper-windows, and other deformities; as with a &#8747;tructure compleat in all it's members, and &#8747;et off with all it's proper decorations. -- But on the &#8747;uppo&#8747;ition I have ventured to &#8747;ugge&#8747;t, we &#8747;ee why the <i>&#8747;ketch</i> may plea&#8747;e beyond the <i>picture</i>; tho the <i>unfini&#8747;hed fabric</i> di&#8747;appoints.  An elegant hou&#8747;e is a
<pb n="17"/>
<i>compleat object</i>.  The imagination can ri&#8747;e no higher.  It receives full &#8747;atisfaction.  But a picture is <i>not an object it&#8747;elf</i>; but only the <i>repre&#8747;entation</i> of an object.  We may ea&#8747;ily therefore conceive, that it may fall below it's archetype; and al&#8747;o below the imagination of the &#8747;pectator, who&#8747;e fancy may be more picture&#8747;que, than the hand of the arti&#8747;t, who compo&#8747;ed the picture.  In this ca&#8747;e, a &#8747;ketch may afford the &#8747;pectator more plea&#8747;ure, as it gives his imagination freer &#8747;cope; and &#8747;uffers it to compleat the arti&#8747;t's imperfect draught from the fund of it's own richer, and more perfect ideas.</p>
<p>The variety of &#8747;cenes, which nature exhibits; and their infinite combinations, and peculiarities, to which neither language, nor colours, unaided by imagination, can, in any degree, do ju&#8747;tice; gave occa&#8747;ion to the&#8747;e remarks, which have carried me perhaps too far into digre&#8747;&#8747;ion.</p>
<p>We had to regret, that we &#8747;aw the vale of Lorton only in half it's beauty.  It was at too late an hour; and the evening be&#8747;ides was dark.  The morning had been cloudy;
<pb n="18"/>
in &#8747;ome part of it rather tempe&#8747;tuous; and we thought our&#8747;elves then very happy in the di&#8747;po&#8747;ition of the weather: for as we had before &#8747;een the mountains in a clear atmo&#8747;phere; it was a de&#8747;irable variety to &#8747;ee the grand effects they produced in a &#8747;torm.  A mountain is nan object of grandeur; and it's dignity receives new force by mixing with the clouds; and arraying it&#8747;elf in the maje&#8747;ty of darkne&#8747;s.  Here the idea of <i>infinity</i> <ptr target="n19"/> produces &#8747;trongly the &#8747;ublime.  But the chearful &#8747;cenes of &#8747;uch a vale as this, pretend not to dignity: they are mere &#8747;cenes of tranquillity.  The early blu&#8747;h of dawn, the noon-tide &#8747;hade, or evening-glow, are the circum&#8747;tances, in which they mo&#8747;t rejoice: a &#8747;torm, in any &#8747;hape, will injure them.  Here therefore we might have di&#8747;pen&#8747;ed with more light, and &#8747;un&#8747;hine.  Or at the clo&#8747;e of day we might have wi&#8747;hed for a quiet, tranquil hour, when the glimmering &#8747;urfaces of things are &#8747;ometimes perhaps more plea&#8747;ing -- at all times certainly more &#8747;oothing, than images of the brighte&#8747;t hue:</p>

</poem>
<p>The evening, which grew more tempe&#8747;tuous, began to clo&#8747;e upon us, as we left the more beautiful parts of the vale of Lorton.  We were &#8747;till about &#8747;ix miles from Ke&#8747;wick; and had before us a very wild country, which probably would have afforded no great amu&#8747;ement even in full day: but amid the ob&#8747;curity, which now over&#8747;pread the land&#8747;cape, the imagination was left at large; and painted many images, which perhaps did not really exi&#8747;t, upon the dead colouring of nature.  Every great and plea&#8747;ing form, whether clear, or ob&#8747;cure, which we had &#8747;een during the day, now played, in &#8747;trong imagery before the fancy: as when the grand chorus cea&#8747;es, ideal mu&#8747;ic vibrates in the ear.</p>
<p>In one part, a view plea&#8747;ed us much; tho perhaps, in &#8747;tronger light, it might have e&#8747;caped notice.  The road made a &#8747;udden dip into a little, winding valley; which being too abrupt for a carriage, was ea&#8747;ed by a
<pb n="20"/>
bridge: and the form of the arch appeared to be what we commonly find in Roman aquaducts.  The winding road; the woody valley, and broken ground below; the mountain beyond; the form of the bridge, which gave a cla&#8747;&#8747;ic air to the &#8747;cene; and the ob&#8747;curity, which melted the whole into one harmonious ma&#8747;s; made all together a very plea&#8747;ing view.</p>
<p>But it &#8747;oon grew too dark even for the imagination to roam.  It was now ten o'clock: and tho in this northern climate, the twilight of a clear &#8747;ummer-evening affords even at that late hour, a bright effulgence; yet now was all dark.</p>

	<line>Threw half an image on the &#8747;training eye.</line>

	<line>And rocks, and mountain-tops, that long retained</line>
	<line>Th' a&#8747;cending gleam, were all one &#8747;wimming &#8747;cene,</line>
	<line>Uncertain if beheld ---- </line>
</poem>
<p>We could ju&#8747;t di&#8747;cern, through the dimne&#8747;s of the night, the &#8747;hadowy forms of the mountains, &#8747;ometimes blotting out half the
<pb n="21"/>
&#8747;ky, on one &#8747;ide; and &#8747;ometimes winding round, as a gloomy barrier on the other.</p>
<p>Often too the road would appear to dive into &#8747;ome dark aby&#8747;s, a cataract roaring at the bottom: while the mountain-torrents on every &#8747;ide ru&#8747;hed down the hills in notes of various cadence, as their quantities of water, the declivities of their fall, their di&#8747;tances, or the intermi&#8747;&#8747;ion of the bla&#8747;t, brought the &#8747;ound fuller, or fainter to the ear; which organ became now more alert, as the imagination depended rather on it, than on the eye for information.</p>
<p>The&#8747;e various notes of water-mu&#8747;ic, an&#8747;wering each other from hill to hill, were a kind of tran&#8747;lation of that pa&#8747;&#8747;age in the p&#8747;alms, in which <i>one deep</i> is repre&#8747;ented <i>calling another becau&#8747;e of the noi&#8747;e of the water-pipes</i>.</p>
<p>Among other images of the night, a lake (for the lake of Ba&#8747;&#8747;enthwait was now in view) appeared through the uncertainty of the gloom, like &#8747;omething of ambiguous texture, &#8747;preading a lengthened gleam of wan, dead light under the dark &#8747;hade of the incumbent mountains: but whether this light
<pb n="22"/>
was owing to vapours arising from the valley; or whether it was water -- and if water, whether it was an arm of the &#8747;ea, a lake, or a river -- tot the uninformed traveller would appear matter of great uncertainty.  Whatever it was, it would &#8747;een &#8747;ufficient to alarm his apprehen&#8747;ions; and to rai&#8747;e in his fancy, (now in the que&#8747;t of dangers,) the idea of &#8747;omething, that might &#8747;top his farther progre&#8747;s.</p>
<p>A good turnpike-road, on which we entered near the village of Lorton, and a knowledge of the country, &#8747;et at naught all &#8747;uch ideas with us: but may ea&#8747;ily be conceived, a that a traveller, wandering in the mid&#8747;t of a &#8747;tormy night, in a mountainous country, unknown, and unbeaten by human foot&#8747;teps, might feel palpitations of a very unea&#8747;y kind.</p>
<p>We have in O&#8747;&#8747;ian &#8747;ome beautiful images, which accompany a night-&#8747;torm in &#8747;uch a country as this.  I &#8747;hall &#8747;ubjoin, with a few alterations, an extract from them; as it will illu&#8747;trate the &#8747;ubject before us.  It is contained in a note on <i>Croma</i>; in which &#8747;everal bards are introduced entertaining their patron with their re&#8747;pective de&#8747;criptions of the night.</p>
<pb n="23"/>
<p>The &#8747;torm gathers on the tops of the mountains; and &#8747;preads it's black mantle before the moon.  It comes forward in the maje&#8747;ty of darkne&#8747;s, moving upon the wings of the bla&#8747;t.  It &#8747;weeps along the vale, and nothing can with&#8747;tand it's force.  The lightning from the rifted cloud fla&#8747;hes before it: the thunder rolls among the mountains in its rear.</p>
<p>All nature is re&#8747;tle&#8747;s, and unea&#8747;y.</p>
<p>The &#8747;tag lies wakeful on the mountain-mo&#8747;s: the hind clo&#8747;e by his &#8747;ide.  She hears the &#8747;torm roaring through the branches of the trees.  She &#8747;tarts -- and lies down again.</p>
<p>The heath-cock lifts his head at intervals; and returns it under his wing.</p>
<p>The owl leaves her unfini&#8747;hed dirge; and &#8747;its ruffled in her feathers in a cleft of the bla&#8747;ted oak.</p>
<p>The fami&#8747;hed fox &#8747;hrinks from the &#8747;torm, and &#8747;eeks the &#8747;helter of his den.</p>
<p>The hunter alarmed, leaps from his pallet in the lonely hut.  He rai&#8747;es his decaying fire.  His wet dogs &#8747;moke around him.  He half-opens his cabin-door, and looks out: but he in&#8747;tantly retreats from the terrors of the night.</p>
<pb n="24"/>
<p>For now the whole &#8747;torm de&#8747;cends.  The mountain-torrents join their impetuous &#8747;treams.  The growing river &#8747;wells.</p>
<p>The benighted traveller pau&#8747;es as he enters the gloomy dell.  The glaring &#8747;ky di&#8747;covers the terrors of the &#8747;cene.  With a face of wild de&#8747;pair he looks round.  He recollects neither the rock above, nor the precipice below.  Still he urges his bewildered way.  His &#8747;teed trembles at the frequent fla&#8747;h.  The thunder bur&#8747;ts over his head -- The torrents roar aloud. -- He attempts the rapid ford. -- Heard you that &#8747;cream? -- It was the &#8747;hriek of death.</p>
<p>How tumultuous is the bo&#8747;om of the lake!  The waves la&#8747;h it's rocky &#8747;ides.  The boat is brimful in the cove.  The oars are da&#8747;hed again&#8747;t the &#8747;hore.</p>
<p>What melancholy &#8747;hade is that &#8747;itting under the tree on the lonely beach? -- I just di&#8747;cern it faintly &#8747;hadowed out by the pale beam of the moon, pa&#8747;&#8747;ing through a thin-robed cloud. -- It is a female form. -- Her eyes are fixed upon the lake.  Her di&#8747;chevelled hair floats loo&#8747;e around her arm, which &#8747;upports her pen&#8747;ive head. -- Ah! mourn-
<pb n="25"/>
ful maid! do&#8747;t thou &#8747;till expect thy lover over the lake? -- Thou &#8747;awe&#8747;t his di&#8747;tant boat, at the clo&#8747;e of day, dancing upon the feathery waves. -- Thy brea&#8747;t throbs with &#8747;u&#8747;pence: but thou knowe&#8747;t not yet, that he lies a corp&#8747;e upon the &#8747;hore.</p>

<p>AFTER a wet, and &#8747;tory night we rejoiced to &#8747;ee the morning ari&#8747;e with all the &#8747;igns of a calm and &#8747;plendid day.  We wi&#8747;hed for the opportunity of &#8747;urveying Ulle&#8747;water in &#8747;erene, bright weather.  This was the next &#8747;cene we propo&#8747;ed to vi&#8747;it; and with which we intended to clo&#8747;e our views of this picture&#8747;que country.</p>
<p>From Ke&#8747;wick we mounted a hill, on the great turnpike road to Penrith.  At the &#8747;ummit we left our hor&#8747;es; and went to examine a Druid temple, in a field on the right.  The diameter of this circle is thirty-two <i>paces</i>; which, as nearly as could be judged from &#8747;o inaccurate a mode of men&#8747;uration, is the diameter of Stonehenge; which I once mea-
<pb n="28"/>
&#8747;ured in the &#8747;ame way.  But the &#8747;tructures are very different; tho the diameters may be nearly equal.  The &#8747;tones here are Sali&#8747;bury-Plain.  If Stonehenge were a cathedral in it's day; this circle was little more than a country church.</p>
<p>The&#8747;e &#8747;tructures, I &#8747;uppo&#8747;e, are by far the mo&#8747;t ancient ve&#8747;tiges of architecture (if we may call them architecture) which we have in England.  Their rude workman&#8747;hip hands down the great barbarity of the times of the Druids: and furni&#8747;hes &#8747;trong proof of the &#8747;avage nature of the religion of the&#8747;e heathen prie&#8747;ts.  Within the&#8747;e magical circles we may conceive any incantations to have been performed; and any rites of &#8747;uper&#8747;tition to have been celebrated.  It is hi&#8747;tory, as well as poetry, when O&#8747;&#8747;ian mentions the <i>circles of &#8747;tones</i>, where our ance&#8747;tors, in their nocturnal orgies, invoked the &#8747;pirits which rode upon the winds -- the awful forms of their decea&#8747;ed forefathers; through which, he &#8747;ublimely tells us, <i>the &#8747;tars dimly twinkled</i>.</p>
<pb n="29"/>
<p>As &#8747;ingular a part as the Druids make in the ancient hi&#8747;tory, not only of Britain, but of other countries, I know not, that I ever &#8747;aw any of their tran&#8747;actions introduced as the &#8747;ubject of a capital picture.  They the can furni&#8747;h a fund of excellent imagery for poetry we know: and I &#8747;ee not why the &#8747;cenes of Caractacus might not be as well &#8747;uited to picture&#8747;que, as dramatic repre&#8747;entation. -- And yet there is a difference.  The drama depends at lea&#8747;t as much on &#8747;entiment, as on repre&#8747;entation.  Whereas the picture depends intirely on the latter.  The beautiful &#8747;entiments of the poet are lo&#8747;t; and the &#8747;pectator mu&#8747;t make out the dialogue, as he is able, from the energetic looks of the figures. -- Hence therefore it follows, that the &#8747;ame &#8747;ubjects are not equally calculated to &#8747;hine in poetry, and in painting.</p>
<p>Tho&#8747;e &#8747;ubjects, no doubt, are be&#8747;t adapted to the pencil, which <i>tell them&#8747;elves by action</i>.  In general, however, all animated &#8747;tories, which admit either of <i>&#8747;trong action</i>, or <i>pa&#8747;&#8747;ion</i>, are judiciou&#8747;ly cho&#8747;en.  Unanimated &#8747;ubjects have little chance of producing an effect; parti-
<pb n="30"/>
cularly love-&#8747;tories; which, of all others, I could wi&#8747;h to exclude from canvas.  The language of love is &#8747;o difficult to tran&#8747;late, that I know not that I ever &#8747;aw a repre&#8747;entation of lovers, who were not &#8747;trongly marked with the character of &#8747;impletons.</p>
<p>But be&#8747;ides &#8747;uch &#8747;ubjects, as admit of &#8747;trong <i>action</i>, or <i>pa&#8747;&#8747;ion</i>, there are other of a more inanimate ca&#8747;t, which, through the peculiarity of the characters, of which they con&#8747;i&#8747;t, can never be mi&#8747;taken.  Such is the &#8747;ettlement of Pen&#8747;ylvania, painted by Mr. We&#8747;t.  From the mixture of Engli&#8747;h, and Indian characters, and a variety of appo&#8747;ite appendages, the &#8747;tory is not only well told; but, as every picture&#8747;que &#8747;tory &#8747;hould be told, it is obvious at &#8747;ight.</p>
<p>Among &#8747;ubjects of this kind, are tho&#8747;e, which occa&#8747;ioned this digre&#8747;&#8747;ion -- druidical &#8747;ubjects.  I know few of the le&#8747;s animated kind, which would admit more picture&#8747;que embelli&#8747;hment, than a Druid-&#8747;acrifice.  The peculiar character, and &#8747;avage features of the&#8747;e barbarous prie&#8747;ts -- their white, flowing ve&#8747;tments -- the branch of mi&#8747;leto, which they hold -- the circular &#8747;tones (if they could be brought into compo&#8747;ition) -- the &#8747;preading oak
<pb n="31"/>
-- the alter beneath it -- and the milk-white &#8747;teer -- might all together form a good picture.</p>
<p>I have often admired an etching by Teipolo, which I have always conceived to be a repre&#8747;entation of this &#8747;ubject<ptr target="n20"/>.  He does not indeed introduce all the circum&#8747;tances of a Druid-&#8747;acrifice, which I have here enumerated: but the characters are &#8747;uch, as exactly &#8747;uit the &#8747;ubject; and the whole &#8747;eems to be an excellent illu&#8747;tration of it.</p>
<note id="n20">It is contained in a book of etchings on emblematical &#8747;ubjects.</note>
<p>After we left the temple of the Druids, we met with little which engaged our attention, till we came to the <i>vale of St. John</i>.  This &#8747;cene appeared from the &#8747;tand, where we viewed it, to be a circular area, of about &#8747;ix, or &#8747;even miles in circumference.  It is &#8747;urrounded intirely by mountains; and is watered by a &#8747;mall river, called the Grata.</p>
<p>The vale of St. John is e&#8747;teemed one of the mo&#8747;t celebrated &#8747;cenes of beauty in the country: but
<pb n="32"/>
it did not an&#8747;wer our expectation.  The ground, con&#8747;i&#8747;ting of patches of fenced meadow, adorned with farm-hou&#8747;es, and clumps of trees, was beautifully tumbled about in many parts: but the whole was rather rich, than picture&#8747;que: and on this account, I &#8747;uppo&#8747;e, it hath obtained it's celebrity.  It's circular form, every where within the &#8747;cope of the eye, wanted that variety, which the <i>winding</i> vale affords; where one part is continually receding from another in all the plea&#8747;ing gradations of per&#8747;pective<ptr target="n21"/>.</p>
<note id="n21">See the &#8747;ame idea applied to water, page 184.</note>
<p>The <i>kind</i> of &#8747;cenery here, is much the &#8747;ame, as in the vale of Lorton: both are compo&#8747;ed of rural objects; but the&#8747;e objects are differently pre&#8747;ented.  In the vale of Lorton, the hou&#8747;es, and hamlets, &#8747;eated on a wandering &#8747;tream, are confined to the &#8747;ame level; and appear of cour&#8747;e, <i>one after another</i>, as &#8747;o many little <i>&#8747;eparate &#8747;cenes</i>.  Here they are &#8747;cattered about the inequalities of the ground, through the area of a vale, circular at lea&#8747;t in appearance; and offer the eye too much at once -- a <i>confu&#8747;ion</i>, rather than a <i>&#8747;uc-
<pb n="33"/>
ce&#8747;&#8747;ion</i>, of &#8747;cenery.  I &#8747;peak however only of the <i>general appearance</i> of the vale: it contains undoubtedly many beautiful &#8747;cenes, if we had had time to explore them.</p>
<p>The plan, or ground-plot, of the vale of Tempe was &#8747;omewhat &#8747;imilar to this of St. John.  Nature &#8747;eems in both to have wrought on the &#8747;ame model; excepting only that the furniture of that very celebrated &#8747;cene of antiquity was more picture&#8747;que.</p>
<p>The vale of Tempe, like this, was circular, and incompa&#8747;&#8747;ed with mountains.  But it's area was compo&#8747;ed of level lawns, (at lea&#8747;t, we &#8747;uppo&#8747;e, not ri&#8747;ing uniformly before the eye,) inter&#8747;per&#8747;ed with wood; which in many parts was thick, and clo&#8747;e; and mu&#8747;t every where have intercepted &#8747;ome portion of the mountain-line, and broken the regularity of a circular <i>&#8747;hape</i>.</p>
<p>The mountains too in Tempe were of a more beautiful &#8747;tructure; abrupt, hung with rock, and finely adorned with wood. -- At the head of the vale was a grand, rocky cha&#8747;m, &#8747;haded with a profu&#8747;ion of wood &#8747;cenery; through which the whole weight of
<pb n="34"/>
the river Peneus forced it's way, with a tremendous &#8747;ound; and having been da&#8747;hed into foam and vapours by the fall, reunited it's &#8747;trength at the bottom, and poured through the vale in a wild, impetuous torrent, roaring over rocks and &#8747;helves, till it found an exit, through the folding of the mountains on the oppo&#8747;ite &#8747;ide.</p>
<p>Elian indeed tells us, that the &#8747;tream was &#8747;mooth: but as Ovid's de&#8747;cription is more picture&#8747;que, the reader will give me leave to con&#8747;ider his authority as more deci&#8747;ive.  His view of Tempe is very noble: but as he meant principally to de&#8747;cribe the palace of a river god, which lay among the caverns, and rece&#8747;&#8747;es of the rocky cha&#8747;m at the entrance of the vale, his &#8747;ubject naturally led him to dwell chiefly on the ca&#8747;cade, which was undoubtedly the greate&#8747;t ornament of the place.</p>

<p>A vale thus circum&#8747;tanced is &#8747;o plea&#8747;ing, that other poets have &#8747;eized the idea in their de&#8747;criptions.  I could multiply quotations: but I &#8747;hall &#8747;elect two, in which the &#8747;ame &#8747;ubject is treated in a different manner.  In one the natural grandeur of the &#8747;cene is &#8747;oftened by little circum&#8747;tances of chearfulne&#8747;s: in the other, it &#8747;trikes in the full majesty of the &#8747;ublime.  The former is more the vale of St. John: the latter approaches nearer the idea of the The&#8747;&#8747;alian vale.</p>

<p>The vale of St. John was, &#8747;ome years ago, the &#8747;cene of one of tho&#8747;e terrible inundations, which wa&#8747;ted lately the vale of Brackenthwait.  I &#8747;hall relate the circum&#8747;tances of it, as they were given to me on the &#8747;pot: but as we had them not perhaps on the be&#8747;t authority, they may, in &#8747;ome particulars, be overcharged.</p>
<p>It was on the 22d of Augu&#8747;t 1749, that this di&#8747;a&#8747;ter happened.  That day, which had been preceded by weather uncommonly clo&#8747;e and &#8747;ultry; &#8747;et in with a gloomy a&#8747;pect.  The blackne&#8747;s gathered, more, and more, from every quarter.  The air was hot beyond &#8747;ufferance.  The whole atmo&#8747;phere, and every thing around was in a &#8747;tate of perfect &#8747;tagnation.  Not a leaf was in motion.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the inhabitants of the vale heard a &#8747;trange noi&#8747;e in various parts around them: but whether it was in the air, or whether it aro&#8747;e from the mountains, they could not a&#8747;certain.  It was like the hollow
<pb n="37"/>
murmur of a ri&#8747;ing wind, among the tops of trees.  This noi&#8747;e (which in a &#8747;maller degree is not an uncommon prelude to a &#8747;torm) continued without intermi&#8747;&#8747;ion about two hours; when a tempe&#8747;t of wind, and rain, and thunder, and lightning &#8747;ucceeded; which was violent, beyond any thing, remembered in former times; and la&#8747;ted, without pau&#8747;e, near three hours.</p>
<p>During this &#8747;torm the cataract fell upon the mountain, on the north of the vale; or as &#8747;ome people thought, tho &#8747;hould &#8747;uppo&#8747;e without any probability, bur&#8747;t from the bowels of it.  The &#8747;ide of that mountain is a continued precipice, through the &#8747;pace of a mile.  This whole tract, we were told, was covered, in an in&#8747;tant, with one continuous ca&#8747;cade of roaring torrent (an appearance, which mu&#8747;t have equalled the fall of Niagara) &#8747;weeping all before it from the top of the mountain to the bottom.  There, like that other inundation, it followed the channel of the brooks it met with; and &#8747;hewed &#8747;imilar effects of it's fury.</p>
<p>One of the&#8747;e effects was a&#8747;toni&#8747;hing.  The fragments of rock, and deluges of &#8747;tone, and &#8747;and, which were &#8747;wept from the mountain
<pb n="38"/>
by the torrent, choked on the &#8747;treams, which received it at the bottom.  The water, thus pent up, and receiving continually va&#8747;t acce&#8747;&#8747;ion of &#8747;trength, after rolling &#8747;ullenly about that part of the vale in frightful whirl-pools, at length forced a new channel through a &#8747;olid rock, which we were informed, it disjointed in &#8747;ome fracture crevice, and made a cha&#8747;m at lea&#8747;t ten feet wide.  Many of the fragments were carried to a great di&#8747;tance; and &#8747;ome of them were &#8747;o large, that a dozen hor&#8747;es could &#8747;carce move them.  We were &#8747;orry afterwards, that we had not &#8747;een this remarkable cha&#8747;m: but we had not time to go in que&#8747;t of it.</p>
<p>From the vale of St. John we a&#8747;cended a &#8747;teep hill, called Branthwait-cragg; where being obliged to leave the great road in our way to Ulle&#8747;water, and inve&#8747;tigate a pathle&#8747;s de&#8747;ert over the mountains, which invironed us; we put our&#8747;elves under the conduct of a guide.</p>
<p>The&#8747;e mountains were covered with a profu&#8747;ion of huge &#8747;tones, and detached rocks; among which we found many old people,
<pb n="39"/>
and children, from the neighbouring villages, gathering a &#8747;pecies of white lychen, that grows upon the craggs; and which we heard had been found very u&#8747;eful in dying a murray-colour.</p>
<p>Among the difficulties of our rout over the&#8747;e mountains, the bogs and mora&#8747;&#8747;es we met with, were the mo&#8747;t trouble&#8747;ome.  We were often obliged to di&#8747;mount; and in &#8747;ome parts the &#8747;urface could hardly bear a man.  Where ru&#8747;hes grew, our guide informed us, the ground was firme&#8747;t.  We endeavoured therefore, as much as po&#8747;&#8747;ible, to make the little tu&#8747;&#8747;ocks of the&#8747;e plants the ba&#8747;is of our foot&#8747;teps.  But as we could not convey this intelligence to our hor&#8747;es, they often plunged very deep.</p>
<p>In &#8747;everal parts of our ride, we had a view of that grand clu&#8747;ter of mountains, which forms a circle in the heart of Cumberland; and makes a back ground to the central views from almo&#8747;t every part of the extremities of that county.  The&#8747;e mountains unite on the &#8747;outh with tho&#8747;e of We&#8747;tmoreland.  The &#8747;ide next us was compo&#8747;ed of Skiddaw -- Threlkate- 
<pb n="40"/>
 
fell, a part of which is called Saddle-back -- and Gri&#8747;edale-fell.  As we rode nearer the northern limit of this chain, Skiddaw, which is by much the highe&#8747;t mountain, appeared, in per&#8747;pective, the lea&#8747;t.  Behind the&#8747;e mountains ari&#8747;e, in order, Mo&#8747;edale-fell -- Carric -- and Caudbeck -- the tops of which we &#8747;ometimes &#8747;aw, from the higher grounds, peering, in their blue attire, over the concave parts of the browner mountains, which &#8747;tood nearer the eye.</p>
<p>Between us, and this circular chain, which occupied the whole horizon on the left, was &#8747;pread a very exten&#8747;ive vale; &#8747;tretching from &#8747;ide to &#8747;ide hardly le&#8747;s than &#8747;even or eight miles; and in length winding out of &#8747;ight.  It is a &#8747;cene of little beauty, except what ari&#8747;es from the gradation of di&#8747;tance: but it &#8747;ugge&#8747;ts and idea of greatne&#8747;s; which &#8747;pace, and grand boundaries, however unadorned, will always &#8747;ugge&#8747;t.</p>
<p>This idea hath &#8747;ometimes mi&#8747;led the ta&#8747;tele&#8747;s improver of little &#8747;cenes.  He has heard, that <i>&#8747;pace gives beauty</i>; but not knowing how to accommodate the rule to circum&#8747;tances, he
<pb n="40.1"/>
<gap desc="unclear landscape orientated oval picture"/>
<pb n="41"/>
often &#8747;hews all that is to be &#8747;een; when, in fact, he &#8747;hould have hid half of it, as a deformity.  <i>Mere</i> &#8747;pace gives the idea of <i>grandeur</i>, rather than of <i>beauty</i>.  Such an idea the ocean pre&#8747;ents.  But a <i>little</i> &#8747;cene cannot pre&#8747;ent it.  <i>Grandeur</i> therefore is not attained by attempting it; while <i>beauty</i> is often lo&#8747;t.</p>
<p>Along this vale ran the great road we had ju&#8747;t left; which was no little ornament to it.  The mazy cour&#8747;e of a river is a &#8747;till nobler object of the &#8747;ame kind: but a great road is no bad &#8747;ub&#8747;titute; and is in &#8747;ome re&#8747;pects &#8747;uperior.  The <i>river</i> being on a level, and contained without banks, is generally too much hid, unle&#8747;s it be viewed from an elevated point: but the <i>road</i> following the inequalities of the ground, is ea&#8747;ily traced by the eye, as it winds along the &#8747;everal elevations and depre&#8747;&#8747;ions it meets with; and has therefore more variety in it's cour&#8747;e.</p>
<p>On the right, forming the other &#8747;ide of this exten&#8747;ive vale, ari&#8747;e &#8747;everal very high
<pb n="42"/>
mountains; among which Hara-&#8747;ide, and White-pike are the mo&#8747;t magnificent.  At the bottom of the&#8747;e, verging towards the &#8747;kirts of the vale, are other hills le&#8747;s formidable: but two of them, called the Mell-fells, are very remarkable; being &#8747;haped like earthen graves, in a country church-yard.</p>
<p>A little before we approached the Mull-fells, the path we pur&#8747;ued, led us under a towering rocky hill, which is known by the name of <i>Wolf's-cragg</i>, and is probably one of the monuments of this animal remaining in Britain.  It is a fortre&#8747;s intirely adapted to a garri&#8747;on of wolves; from whence they might plunder the vale, which was &#8747;pread before them; and make prey of every thing, as far as the eye could reach.  Such a &#8747;cene, in painting, would be highly characterized by &#8747;uch appendages.  It would have plea&#8747;ed Ridinger.  If that picture&#8747;que naturali&#8747;t had been in que&#8747;t of a wolf-&#8747;cene, he could not have found a better.</p>
<pb n="43"/>
<p>When we had pa&#8747;&#8747;ed this range of mountains, we got more into a beaten path, leading to the village of Matterdale, about a mile only from Ulle&#8747;water; which was &#8747;till intirely excluded from our &#8747;ight by high grounds.  Here we di&#8747;mi&#8747;&#8747;ed our guide, and were directed into Gobray-park, which is the northern boundary of the lake.</p>
<p>This part of the country we found well inhabited; and the roads, at this &#8747;ea&#8747;on, much frequented.  It was about the time of a &#8747;tatute-fair; when the young people of the country leave their old &#8747;ervices, and go to their new and we were not a little entertained with the &#8747;implicity, and variety of the &#8747;everal groups and figures we met, both on hor&#8747;eback, and on foot.</p>
<p>The&#8747;e are the picture&#8747;que inhabitants of a land&#8747;cape.  The dre&#8747;&#8747;ed-out figures, and gaudy carriages, along the great roads of the capital, afford them not.  The pencil rejects with indignation the &#8747;plendor of art.  In grand &#8747;cenes, even the pea&#8747;ant cannot be admitted,
<pb n="44"/>
if he be employed in the low occupations of his profe&#8747;&#8747;ion: the &#8747;pade, the &#8747;cythe, and the rake are all excluded.</p>
<p>Moral, and picture&#8747;que ideas do not always coincide.  In a moral light, cultivation, in all it's parts, is plea&#8747;ing; the hedge, and the furrow; the waving corn field, and the ripened &#8747;heaf.  But all the&#8747;e, the picture&#8747;que eye, in que&#8747;t of &#8747;cenes of grandeur, and beauty, looks at with di&#8747;gu&#8747;t.  It ranges after nature, untamed by art, and bur&#8747;ting wildly into all it's irregular forms.</p>
<poem>
	<line> ---- Juvat arva videre</line>
	<line>Non ra&#8747;tris hominum, non ulli abnoxia cur&#230;</line>
</poem>
<p>It is thus al&#8747;o in the introduction of figures.  In a moral view, the indu&#8747;trious mechanic is a more plea&#8747;ing object, than the loitering pea&#8747;ant.  But in a picture&#8747;que light, it is otherwi&#8747;e.  The arts of indu&#8747;try are rejected; and even idlene&#8747;s, if I may &#8747;o &#8747;peak, adds dignity to a character.  Thus the lazy cow-herd re&#8747;ting on his pole; or the pea&#8747;ant lolling on a rock, may be allowed in the grande&#8747;t &#8747;cenes; while the laborious mechanic, with his impliments of labour, would be repul&#8747;ed.
<pb n="45"/>
The fi&#8747;herman, it is true, may follow his calling upon the lake: but he is indebted for this privilege, not to his art; but to the picture&#8747;que apparatus of it -- his boat, and his nets, which qualify his art.  <i>They</i> are the objects: <i>he</i> is but an appendage.  Place him on the &#8747;hore, as a &#8747;ingle figure, with his rod, and line; and his art would ruin him.  In a chearful glade, along a purling brook, near &#8747;ome mill, or cottage, let him angle, if he plea&#8747;e: in &#8747;uch a &#8747;cene the picture&#8747;que eye takes no offence.  But let him take care not to introduce the vulgarity of his employment in a &#8747;cene of grandeur.</p>
<p>At the &#8747;ame time, we mu&#8747;t ob&#8747;erve, that figures, which thus take their importance merely from not mixing with low, mechanic arts, are at be&#8747;t only <i>picture&#8747;que appendages</i>.  They are of a negative nature, neither adding to the grandeur of the idea, nor taking from it.  They merely and &#8747;imply <i>adorn</i> a &#8747;cene.</p>
<p>The characters, which are mo&#8747;t <i>&#8747;uited to the&#8747;e &#8747;cenes</i> of grandeur, are &#8747;uch as impre&#8747;s us with &#8747;ome idea of greatne&#8747;s, wildne&#8747;s, or ferocity; all which touch on the &#8747;ublime.</p>
<pb n="46"/>
<p>Figures in long, folding draperies; gyp&#8747;ies; banditti; and &#8747;oldiers, -- not in modern regimentals; but as Virgil paints them,</p>
<poem>
	<line> ---- longis adnixi ha&#8747;tis, et &#8747;cuta tenentes;</line>
</poem>
<p>are all marked with one or other of the&#8747;e characters: and mixing with the magnificence, wildne&#8747;s, or horror of the place, they properly coale&#8747;ce; and reflecting the &#8747;ame images, add a deeper tinge to the character of the &#8747;cene.</p>
<p>For the truth of all the&#8747;e remarks I might appeal to the deci&#8747;ive judgment of Salvator Ro&#8747;a; who &#8747;eems to have thoroughly &#8747;tudied propriety in figures, e&#8747;pecially in &#8747;cenes of grandeur.  His works are a model on this head.  We have a book of figures, particularly compo&#8747;ed for &#8747;cenery of this kind, and etched by him&#8747;elf.  In this collection there is great variety, both in the characters, groups, and dre&#8747;&#8747;es: but I do not remember, either there, or in any other of his works, a low, mechanic character.  All his figures are either of (what I have called) the <i>negative</i> kind; or marked with &#8747;ome trait of <i>greatne&#8747;s</i>, <i>wildne&#8747;s</i>, or <i>ferocity</i>.  Of this la&#8747;t &#8747;pecies his
<pb n="47"/>
figures generally partook: his grand &#8747;cenes being inhabited chiefly by banditti.</p>
<p>I met with a pa&#8747;&#8747;age, not a little illu&#8747;trative of the&#8747;e remarks on figures, in the travels of Mr. Thickne&#8747;s through Spain.</p>
<p>"The wor&#8747;t &#8747;ort of beggars, &#8747;ays he, in Spain are the troops of male, and female gyp&#8747;ies.  They are of the genuine breed, and differ widely from all other gyp&#8747;ies; and I may &#8747;ay, from all other human beings.  I often met troops of the&#8747;e people; and when an interview happens in roads very di&#8747;tant from towns, or dwellings, it is not very plea&#8747;ing;: for they a&#8747;k, as if they knew they were not to be refu&#8747;ed; and I dare &#8747;ay often commit murders, when they can commit them by &#8747;urprize.  They are extremely &#8747;warthy, with hair as black as jet; and form very picture&#8747;que groups under the &#8747;hade of the rocks and trees of the Pyr&#230;nean mountains, where they &#8747;pend their evenings: and live &#8747;uitably to the climate; where bread, and water, and idlene&#8747;s, are preferable to better fare, and hard-labour."</p>

<p>ON de&#8747;cending the hill from Matterdale, before we came to the lake, we had a beautiful <i>&#8747;pecimen</i> (as the naturali&#8747;ts &#8747;peak) of what in this country is called a <i>gill</i>.  The road carried us along the edge of one of it's precipices: but the cha&#8747;m was &#8747;o intirely filled with wood, that when we looked down, we could not &#8747;ee into it.  Even the &#8747;un-beams, unable to enter, re&#8747;ted only on the tufted foliage of the trees, which grew from the &#8747;ides. -- But though the eye was excluded, the ear was &#8747;oothed by the harmony of an invi&#8747;ible torrent; who&#8747;e notes, &#8747;ounding along innumerable broken falls, and &#8747;oftened by a&#8747;cending through the trees, were very melodious.</p>
<p>A winding road brought us to the bottom; where the torrent tumbling out of the wood, received us.  We had a &#8747;hort view into the
<pb n="50"/>
deep rece&#8747;&#8747;es of the &#8747;cene, through the branches of the trees, which &#8747;tretched over the &#8747;tream; but we had not time, to penetrate the alluring &#8747;hade.</p>
<p>Having pa&#8747;&#8747;ed over more high grounds, we came at length in view of the lake.  The fir&#8747;t catch of it was thus pre&#8747;ented.</p>
<p>A road occupied the neare&#8747;t part of the land&#8747;cape, winding around a broken cliff; which ro&#8747;e con&#8747;iderably on the left.  A portion of a di&#8747;tant mountain appeared on the right, with a &#8747;mall part of the lake at it's foot.  The fore-ground was well-di&#8747;po&#8747;ed; and the di&#8747;tant mountain, which fell into the lake, beautifully tinted.  The compo&#8747;ition, as far as it went, was very correct: but we yet &#8747;aw only enough to excite our curio&#8747;ity; and to give us, from the bearing of the land, a general idea of the lake.</p>
<p>Ulle&#8747;water is the large&#8747;t lake in this country, except Windermere; being eight miles long; and about two broad in the wide&#8747;t part; tho, in general, it rarely exceeds a mile in
<pb n="51"/>
breadth.  It points nearly north, and &#8747;outh; as mo&#8747;t of the&#8747;e lakes do; but being placed at an <i>extremity</i> of the barrier-mountains, it affords a greater variety than is exhibited by &#8747;uch lakes, as are <i>invironed</i> by them.  The&#8747;e having few accompaniments, receive their character chiefly from the &#8747;urrounding de&#8747;olation.  Such a lake is Wythburn.  Windermere, on the other hand, Ke&#8747;wick, Butermer, and Ulle&#8747;water may all be called <i>boundary-lakes</i>.  One end of each participates more of the rugged country; and the other of the cultivated: tho each end participates, in &#8747;ome degree, of both.  A few traits of romantic &#8747;cenery are added to the tamene&#8747;s of one end; and the native horror of the other is &#8747;oftened by a few chearful appendages.</p>
<p>The form of Ulle&#8747;water re&#8747;embles a Z; only there is no angular acutene&#8747;s in it's line.  It &#8747;preads every where in a ea&#8747;y curve; beautifully broken in &#8747;ome parts by promontories. -- The middle reach contains in length near two thirds of the lake.  The &#8747;outhern &#8747;ide is mountainous; and becomes more &#8747;o, as it verges towards the we&#8747;t.  As the mountains approach the north, they glide (as we have &#8747;een is u&#8747;ual in <i>boundary-lakes</i>) into meadows
<pb n="52"/>
and pa&#8747;tures.  The northern and we&#8747;tern &#8747;ides contain a great variety of woody and rocky &#8747;cnes; but the&#8747;e al&#8747;o, as they approach the ea&#8747;t, become &#8747;mooth and fertilized.  At the &#8747;outhern point, under impending mountains, lies the village of Patterdale. -- With this general idea of Ulle&#8747;water, let us return to the de&#8747;cent from Matterdale, where we caught the fir&#8747;t view of it.</p>
<p>As we de&#8747;cended a little further, the whole &#8747;cene of the lake opened before us; and &#8747;uch a &#8747;cene, as almo&#8747;t drew from us the apo&#8747;trophe of the inraptured bard,</p>

</poem>
<p>Among all the <i>vi&#8747;ions</i> of the inchanting country, we had &#8747;een nothing &#8747;o beautifully &#8747;ublime, &#8747;o correctly picture&#8747;que as this. -- And yet I am aver&#8747;e to make compari&#8747;ons; e&#8747;pecially on &#8747;eeing a country but once.  Much depends on the circum&#8747;tances of light, and weather.  I would wi&#8747;h therefore only to &#8747;ay, that I was <i>more plea&#8747;ed</i> with Ulle&#8747;water, than with any lake I had &#8747;een; adding, at the &#8747;ame time, that we were fortunate in a concurrence
<pb n="53"/>
of incidents, that aided it's beauty.  We had hitherto &#8747;een all the lakes we had vi&#8747;ited, under a rough, or cloudy &#8747;ky: and tho their dignity was certainly increa&#8747;ed by the circum&#8747;tance; yet the beauty of a lake in &#8747;plendid, &#8747;erene weather, aided, at this time, by the powers of contra&#8747;t, made a wonderful impre&#8747;&#8747;ion on the imagination.</p>
<p>"The effect of the <i>&#8747;ublime</i>, Mr. Burke informs us, is <i>a&#8747;toni&#8747;hment</i>; and the effect of <i>beauty</i>, is <i>plea&#8747;ure:</i> but when the two ingredients mix, the effect, he &#8747;ays, is in a good mea&#8747;ure de&#8747;troyed in both.  They con&#8747;titute a &#8747;pecies &#8747;omething different both from the &#8747;ublime and beautiful, which I have before called <i>fine:</i> but this kind, I imagine, has not &#8747;uch a power on the pa&#8747;&#8747;ions, either as va&#8747;t bodies have, which are endowed with the corre&#8747;pondent qualities of the &#8747;ublime; or as the qualities of beauty have, when united in a &#8747;mall object.  The affection produced by large bodies, adorned with the &#8747;poils of beauty, is a tention conti-

<note id="n22">Sublime and beautiful, part IV. &#8747;ect. 25.</note>
<p>This refined rea&#8747;oning does not &#8747;eem intirely grounded on experience. -- I do not remember any &#8747;cene in which beauty and &#8747;ublimity, according to my idea, are more blended than in this: and tho Mr. Burke's ideas of beauty are perhaps more exceptionable, than his ideas od the &#8747;ublime; yet it happens, that mo&#8747;t of the qualities, which hee predicates of both, unite al&#8747;o in this &#8747;cene.  Their effect therefore, according to his argument, &#8747;hould be de&#8747;troyed.  But the feelings of every lover of nature, on viewing the&#8747;e &#8747;cenes, I adre be bold to &#8747;ay, would reevolt from &#8747;uch rea&#8747;oning.</p>
<p>The fore-ground of the grand view before us, is a part of Gobray-park, which belongs to the duke of Norfolk; rough, broken, and woody.  Among the old oaks, which inriched it, herds of deer, and cattle grazed in groups.  Beyond this is &#8747;pread an exten&#8747;ive reach of the lake, winding round a rocky promontory on the left;
<pb n="54.1"/>
<gap desc="unclear landscape orientated picture"/>
<pb n="55"/>
which is the point of a mountain, called Martindale-fell, or Place-fell; the &#8747;outhern boundary of the lake.  This promontory uniting with the mountain, lets it ea&#8747;ily down into the water, as by a &#8747;tep.  An <i>he&#8747;itation</i>, if I may &#8747;o call it, of this kind, ea&#8747;es greatly the heavine&#8747;s of a line.  In a <i>di&#8747;tance</i>, it is of le&#8747;s con&#8747;equence: but in all the <i>nearer</i> grounds, it is nece&#8747;&#8747;ary.  I &#8747;peak chiefly however of tho&#8747;e &#8747;cenes, in which beauty, and grandeur are combined.  In tho&#8747;e of &#8747;imple grandeur, and &#8747;ublimity, as in that of Penmanmaur, for in&#8747;tance, in north wales, the heavy line, which is very remarkable in that &#8747;cene, perhaps &#8747;trengthens the effect.</p>
<p>Martindale-fell is intirely unplanted: but it's line, and &#8747;urface are both well varied.  Numberle&#8747;s breaks (little vallies, and knolls) give it a lightne&#8747;s, without injuring it's &#8747;implicity.</p>
<p>Such was the di&#8747;po&#8747;ition of the objects, on the left of the lake: on the right, two woody promontories, pur&#8747;uing each other in per&#8747;pective, made a beautiful contra&#8747;t with the &#8747;mooth continuity of Martindale-fell.</p>
<p>In front, the di&#8747;tance was compo&#8747;ed of mountains, falling gently into the lake; near
<pb n="56"/>
the edge of which lies the village of Patterdale.</p>
<p>We took this view at a point, which had ju&#8747;t &#8747;o much elevation, as to give a variety to the lines of the lake.  As we de&#8747;cended to the water, the view was &#8747;till grand, and beautiful, but had lo&#8747;t &#8747;ome of it's more picture&#8747;que beauties: it had lo&#8747;t the fore-ground: it had lo&#8747;t the &#8747;weeping line round the mountain on the left: and it had lo&#8747;t the rece&#8747;s between the two woody promontories on the right.  The whole margin of the lake was nearly reduced to one &#8747;traight line. -- The beauty of a view, e&#8747;pecially in lake-&#8747;cenery, we have before ob&#8747;erved<ptr target="n23"/>, depends greatly on the nice po&#8747;ition of it's point.</p>
<note id="n23">See page 96.  Vol. I.</note>
<p>Having &#8747;pent &#8747;ome time in examining this very inchanting &#8747;cene, we &#8747;kirted the lake towards Patterdale, on a tolerable road, which runs from one end of it to the other: on the &#8747;outh it is continued to Amble&#8747;ide; on the north, to Penrith.  I call it a tolerable road; but I mean only for hor&#8747;es.  It has not the
<pb n="57"/>
quartering and commodious width of a carriage road.</p>
<p>As we left Gobray-park, we took our rout along the margin of the fir&#8747;t of tho&#8747;e woody promontories on the right.  We were carried by the &#8747;ide of the lake, through clo&#8747;e lanes, and thick groves: and yet no &#8747;o thick, but that we had every where, through the openings of the trees, and windings of the road, views in front, and on the right, into woody rece&#8747;&#8747;es; &#8747;ome of which were very plea&#8747;ing: and on the left, the lake and all it's di&#8747;tant furniture, broke frequently upon us.</p>
<p>After &#8747;kirting the fir&#8747;t wooded promontory, which carried us about a mile, the road turned &#8747;uddenly to the right, and led us round into the &#8747;econd, ri&#8747;ing a con&#8747;iderable height above the water. -- In this promontory, a new &#8747;cene opened: the woods became intermixed with rock; and a great variety of very beautiful fore-grounds were produced.  The rocks, through which the road was &#8747;ometimes cut, were chiefly on our right. -- In this promon-
<pb n="58"/>
tory al&#8747;o, as well as in the other, we were amu&#8747;ed with catches of the lake, and of Martindale-fell, through the tree.</p>
<p>Scenes, like the&#8747;e, are adapted to every &#8747;tate of the &#8747;ky.  They were beautiful in the calm &#8747;ea&#8747;on, in which we &#8747;aw them; and in which indeed we wi&#8747;hed to &#8747;ee them.  But they would have received peculiar advantages al&#8747;o from &#8747;torm.  The objects are all in that great &#8747;tyle, which is &#8747;uited to the violences of nature.  The imagination would have ri&#8747;en with the tempe&#8747;t, and give a double grandeur to every awful form. -- The trees, in the mean time, which rear them&#8747;elves &#8747;tage above &#8747;tage, upon the mountain's brow, and &#8747;pread down to the very road, would have made a noble in&#8747;trument for the hollow bla&#8747;t to &#8747;ound, con&#8747;i&#8747;ting of various notes: while the &#8747;urges of the lake, re&#8747;ounding among the caverns, and da&#8747;hing again&#8747;t the rocks, many fathoms below, would have aided the concert with new notes of terrific harmony.</p>

<p>The mind is not always indeed in uni&#8747;on with &#8747;uch &#8747;cenes, and circum&#8747;tances, as the&#8747;e.  When it does not happen to be &#8747;o, no effect can be produced.  Sometimes indeed the &#8747;cene may draw the mind into uni&#8747;on; if it be not under the impre&#8747;&#8747;ion of any &#8747;trong pa&#8747;&#8747;ion of an oppo&#8747;ite kind; but in a &#8747;ort of neutral &#8747;tate.  The effect however will always be &#8747;tronge&#8747;t, when the mind happens to be po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ed of ideas congenial to the &#8747;cene -- when, in a <i>kindly mood of melancholy</i>, it feels it&#8747;elf &#8747;oother by the objects around.</p>
<p>But be&#8747;ides the mu&#8747;ic of winds are tempe&#8747;ts, the ecchoes, which are excited in different parts of this lake, are &#8747;till more grand, and affecting.  More or le&#8747;s they accompany all lakes, that circum&#8747;cribed by lofty, and rocky &#8747;cenes.  We found them on Windermere; we found them on Derwentwater.  But
<pb n="60"/>
every lake, being &#8747;urrounded by rocks and mountains of a &#8747;tructure peculiar to it&#8747;elf, forms a variety of <unclear>in&#8747;truments</unclear> and, of cour&#8747;e, a variety of &#8747;ounds.  The ecchoes therefore of no two lakes are alike; unle&#8747;s they are mere monotoni&#8747;ts.</p>
<p>We took notice of a very grand eccho on the we&#8747;tern &#8747;hores of the great i&#8747;land in Windermere: but the mo&#8747;t celebrated ecchoes are &#8747;aid to be found on Ulle&#8747;water; in &#8747;ome of which the &#8747;ound of a cannon is di&#8747;tinctly reverberated &#8747;ix, or &#8747;even times.  It fir&#8747;t rolls over the head in one va&#8747;t peal. -- Then &#8747;ub&#8747;iding a few &#8747;econds, it ri&#8747;es again in a grand, interrupted bur&#8747;t, perhaps on the right. -- Another &#8747;olemn pau&#8747;e en&#8747;ues.  Then the &#8747;ound ari&#8747;es again on the left. -- Thus thrown from rock to rock, in a &#8747;ort of aerial per&#8747;pective, it is caught again perhaps by &#8747;ome nearer promontory; and returning full on the ear, &#8747;urprizes you, after you thought all had been over, with as great a peal as at fir&#8747;t.</p>
<p>But the grande&#8747;t effect of this kind is produced by a <i>&#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ive</i> di&#8747;charge of cannon<ptr target="n24"/>;

<pb n="61"/>
at the interval of a few &#8747;econds between each di&#8747;charge.  The effect of the fir&#8747;t is not over, when the ecchoes of the &#8747;econd, the third, or perhaps of the &#8747;econd, the third, or perhaps of the fourth, begin.  Such a variety of awful &#8747;ounds, mixing, and commixing, and at the &#8747;ame moment heard from all &#8747;ides, have a wonderful effect on the mind; as if the every foundations of every rock on the lake were giving way; and the whole &#8747;cene, from &#8747;ome &#8747;trange convul&#8747;ion, were falling into general ruin.</p>
<note id="n24">The duke of Portland, who has property in this neighbourhood, has a ve&#8747;&#8747;el on the lake, with bra&#8747;s guns, for the purpo&#8747;e of exciting ecchoes.</note>
<p>The&#8747;e &#8747;ounds, which are all of the terrific kind, are &#8747;uited chiefly to &#8747;cenes of grandeur during &#8747;ome moment of wildne&#8747;s, when the lake is under the agitation of a &#8747;torm.  In a calm, &#8747;till evening, the gradations of an eccho, dying away in di&#8747;tant thunder, are certainly heard with mo&#8747;t advantage.  But that is a different idea.  You attend then only to the <i>ecchoes</i> them&#8747;elves.  When you take the <i>&#8747;cene</i> into the combination; and attend to the effect of the <i>whole together</i>; no doubt &#8747;uch &#8747;ounds, as are of the mo&#8747;t violent kind, are be&#8747;t &#8747;uited to moments of the greate&#8747;t uproar.</p>
<p>But there is another &#8747;pecies of ecchoes, which are as well adapted to the lake in all it's &#8747;tillne&#8747;s, and tranquillity, as the others
<pb n="62"/>
are to it's wildne&#8747;s, and confu&#8747;ion: and which recommend them&#8747;elves chiefly to tho&#8747;e feelings, which depend on the gentler movements of the mind.  In&#8747;tead of cannon, let a few French-horns, and clarionets be introduced.  Softer mu&#8747;ic than &#8747;uch loud wind-in&#8747;truments, would &#8747;carce have power to vibrate.  The effect is now wonderfully changed.  The &#8747;ound of a cannon is heard in bur&#8747;ts. It is the mu&#8747;ic only of thunder.  But the <i>continuation</i> of <i>mu&#8747;ical &#8747;ounds</i> forms a <i>continuation</i> of <i>mu&#8747;ical ecchoes</i>; which reverberating around the lake, are exqui&#8747;itely melodious in their &#8747;everal gradations; and form a thou&#8747;and &#8747;ymphonies, playing together from every part.  The variety of notes is inconceivable.  The ear is not equal to their innumerable combinations.  It li&#8747;tens to a &#8747;ymphony dying away at a di&#8747;tance; when other melodious &#8747;ounds ari&#8747;e clo&#8747;e at hand.  The&#8747;e have &#8747;carce attracted the attention; when a different mode of harmony ari&#8747;es from another quarter.  In &#8747;hort, every rock is vocal, and the whole lake is transformed into a kind of magical &#8747;cene; in which every promontory &#8747;eems peopled by aerial beings, an&#8747;wering each other in cele&#8747;tial mu&#8747;ic.</p>

<p>We had now almo&#8747;t &#8747;kirted the two woody promontories in our rout to Patterdale.  The conclu&#8747;ion is the grande&#8747;t part of the whole &#8747;cenery.  It is a bold projection of rock finely marked, and adorned with hanging woods; under the beetling &#8747;ummit of which the road makes a &#8747;udden turn.  This is the point of the &#8747;econd promontory; and, I believe, is known by the name of <i>Stibray-cragg</i>.</p>
<p>The trees which compo&#8747;e the whole &#8747;cenery through both the&#8747;e promontories, are in general, oak.</p>
<p>From hence through lanes of the &#8747;ame kind, though le&#8747;s &#8747;uperbly decorated, we came to the village of Patterdale; &#8747;ituated on ri&#8747;ing ground, among two or three little
<pb n="64"/>
rivers, or branches of a river, which feed the lake.  It lies in a cove of mountains, open in front to the &#8747;outhern reach of the lake; beyond which appear the high and woody lands of Gobray-park.  The &#8747;ituation is magnificent.</p>
<p>Among the cottages of this village, there is a hou&#8747;e, belonging to a per&#8747;on of a &#8747;omewhat better condition; who&#8747;e little e&#8747;tate, which he occupies him&#8747;elf, lies in the neighbourhood.  As his property, incon&#8747;iderable as it is, is better than that of any of his neighbours, it has gained him the title of <i>King of Patterdale</i>, in which his family name is lo&#8747;t.  His ance&#8747;tors have long enjoyed the title before him.  We had the honour of &#8747;eeing this prince, as he took the diver&#8747;ion of fi&#8747;hing on the lake; and I could not help thinking, that if I were inclined to envy the &#8747;ituation of any potentate in Europe, it would be that of the king of Patterdale.  The pride of Wind&#8747;or and Ver&#8747;ailles would &#8747;hrink in a compari&#8747;on with the magnificence of his dominions.</p>
<pb n="65"/>
<p>The great &#8747;implicity of this country, and that rigid temperance, and economy, which nece&#8747;&#8747;ity injoins to all it's inhabitants, may be exemplified by the following little hi&#8747;tory.</p>
<p>A clergyman, of the name of Matti&#8747;on, was mini&#8747;ter of this place &#8747;ixty years; and died lately at the age of ninety.  During the early part of his life, his benefice brought him in only twelve pounds a year.  It was afterwards increa&#8747;ed, (I &#8747;uppo&#8747;e by the queen's bounty,) to eighteen; which it never exceeded.  On this income he married -- brought up four children -- lived comfortably among his neighbours -- educated a &#8747;on, I believe, at college -- and left upwards of 1000&#163;. behind him.</p>
<p>With that &#8747;ingular &#8747;implicity, and inattention to forms which characterize a country like this; he him&#8747;elf read the burial-&#8747;ervice over his mother; he married his father to a &#8747;econd wife; and afterwards buried him al&#8747;o.  He publi&#8747;hed his own banns of marriage in the church, with a woman, whom he had formerly chri&#8747;tened; and him&#8747;elf married all his four children.</p>
<pb n="66"/>
<p>From this &#8747;pecimen, the manners of the country may ea&#8747;ily be conceived.  At a di&#8747;tance from the refinements of the age, they are at a di&#8747;tance al&#8747;o from it's vices.  Many &#8747;age writers, and Monte&#8747;quieu <ptr target="n25"/> in particular, have &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed the&#8747;e rough &#8747;cenes of nature to have a great effect on the human mind: and have found virtues in mountainous countries, which were not the growth of tamer regions.  Many opinions perhaps have pa&#8747;&#8747;ed current among mankind, which have le&#8747;s foundation in truth.  Monte&#8747;quieu is in que&#8747;t chiefly of political virtue -- liberty -- bravery -- and the arts of bold defence: but, I believe, private virtue is equally befriended by the&#8747;e rough &#8747;cenes.  It is &#8747;ome happine&#8747;s indeed to the&#8747;e people, that they have no great roads among them; and that their &#8747;imple villages, on the &#8747;ides of lakes, and mountains, are in no line of communication with any of the bu&#8747;y haunts of men.  Ignorance is &#8747;ometimes called the mother of vice.  I apprehend it to be as often the nur&#8747;e of innocence.</p>

<p>Much have tho&#8747;e travellers to an&#8747;wer for, who&#8747;e ca&#8747;ual intercour&#8747;e with this innocent, and &#8747;imple people tends to corrupt them; di&#8747;&#8747;eminating among them ideas of extravagance, and di&#8747;&#8747;ipation -- giving them a ta&#8747;te for plea&#8747;ures, and gratifications, of which they had no ideas -- in&#8747;piring them with di&#8747;content at home -- and tainting their rough, indu&#8747;trious manners with idlene&#8747;s, and a thir&#8747;t after di&#8747;hone&#8747;t means.</p>
<p>If travellers would frequent this country with a view to examine it's grandeur, and beauty -- or to explore it's varied, and curious regions with the eye of philo&#8747;ophy -- or, if that could be hoped, to adore the great Creator in the&#8747;e his &#8747;ublimer works -- if, in their pa&#8747;&#8747;age through it, they could be content with &#8747;uch fare as the country produces; or, at lea&#8747;t reconcile them&#8747;elves to it by manly exerci&#8747;e, and fatigue (for there is a time, when the &#8747;tomach, and the plaine&#8747;t food will be found in perfect harmony) -- if they could thus, in&#8747;tead of corrupting the manners of an innocent people; learn to amend their own,
<pb n="68"/>
by &#8747;eeing in how narrow a compa&#8747;s the wants of human life may be compre&#8747;&#8747;ed -- a journey through the&#8747;e wild &#8747;cenes might be attended perhaps with more improvement, than a journey to Rome, or Paris.  Where manners are poli&#8747;hed into vicious refinement, &#8747;implifying is the be&#8747;t mode of improving; and the example of innocence is a more in&#8747;tructive le&#8747;&#8747;on, than any that can be taught by arti&#8747;ts, and literati.</p>
<p>But the&#8747;e &#8747;cenes are too often the re&#8747;ort of gay company, who are under no impre&#8747;&#8747;ions of this kind -- who have no ideas, but of extending the &#8747;phere of their amu&#8747;ements -- or, of varying a life of di&#8747;&#8747;ipation.  The grandeur of the country is not taken into the que&#8747;tion: or, at lea&#8747;t it is no otherwi&#8747;e con&#8747;idered, than as affording &#8747;ome new mode of plea&#8747;urable enjoyment.  Thus even the diver&#8747;ions of Newmarket are introduced -- diver&#8747;ions, one would imagine, more foreign to the nature of this country, than any other.  A number of hor&#8747;es are carried into the middle of a lake in a flat boat.  A plug is drawn from the bottom: the boat &#8747;inks, and the hor&#8747;es are left floating on the &#8747;urface.  In dif-

ferent directions they make to land; and the hor&#8747;e, which &#8747;oone&#8747;t arrives, &#8747;ecures the prize.</p>

<p>HAVING &#8747;pent two hours at Patterdale, in refre&#8747;hing our hor&#8747;es, and in &#8747;urveying the beauty of it's &#8747;ituation; we left it with regret, and &#8747;et out for Penrith.</p>
<p>We had now the whole length of the lake to &#8747;kirt; part of which we had already traver&#8747;ed in our rout from Gobray-park: but we felt no reluctance at taking a &#8747;econd view of it.</p>
<p>As we traver&#8747;ed the two woody promontories, which we had pa&#8747;&#8747;ed in the morning, we had a grand exhibition of the middle reach of the lake; which, I have ob&#8747;erved, is by far the longe&#8747;t.  Martindale-fell, &#8747;hooting into the water, which before adorned the left
<pb n="72"/>
of the land&#8747;cape, now took it's &#8747;tation on the right.  The left was compo&#8747;ed of the high woody grounds about Gobray-park. -- In the center, the hills gently declining, formed a boundary at the bottom of the lake; &#8747;tretching far to the ea&#8747;t. -- As a fore-ground, we had the woods, and rocks of the two promontories, through which we pa&#8747;&#8747;ed.</p>
<p>Such were the outlines, and compo&#8747;ition of the view before us; but it's colouring was &#8747;till more exqui&#8747;ite.</p>
<p>The &#8747;un was now de&#8747;cending low, and ca&#8747;t the broad &#8747;hades of evening athwart the land&#8747;cape: while his beams, gleaming with yellow lu&#8747;tre through the vallies, &#8747;pread over the inlightened &#8747;ummits of the mountains, a thou&#8747;and lovely tints -- in &#8747;ober harmony, where &#8747;ome deep rece&#8747;s was faintly &#8747;hadowed -- in &#8747;plendid hue, where jutting knolls, or promontories received the fuller radiance of the diverging ray.  The air was &#8747;till: the lake one va&#8747;t expan&#8747;e of cry&#8747;tal mirror.  The mountain-&#8747;hadows, which &#8747;ometimes give the water a deep, black hue (in many circum&#8747;tances, extremely picture&#8747;que;) were &#8747;oftened here
<pb n="73"/>
into a mild, blue tint, which &#8747;wept over half the &#8747;urface.  The other half received the fair impre&#8747;&#8747;ion of every radiant form, that glowed around.  The inverted land&#8747;cape was touched in fainter colours, than the real one.  Yet it it was more than <i>laid in</i>.  It was almo&#8747;t fini&#8747;hed.  The la&#8747;t touches alone were wanting.</p>
<p>What an admirable &#8747;tudy for the pallet is &#8747;uch a &#8747;cene as this! infinitely beyond the camera's contracted bounds.  Here you &#8747;ee nature in her full dimen&#8747;ions.  You are let into the very my&#8747;tery -- into every artifice, of her pencil.  In the <i>reflected picture</i>, you &#8747;ee the <i>ground &#8747;he lays in</i> -- the great effects pre&#8747;erved -- and that veil of expre&#8747;&#8747;ive ob&#8747;curity thrown over all, in which what is done, is done &#8747;o exqui&#8747;itely, that if you wi&#8747;h the <i>fini&#8747;hing touches</i>, you wi&#8747;h them only by the &#8747;ame inimitable hand that gave &#8747;ketch.  Turn from the &#8747;hadow to the reality, and you have them.  There the ob&#8747;curity is detailed.  The picture, and the &#8747;ketch reflect mutual graces on each other.</p>
<p>I dwell the longer on this &#8747;cene, becau&#8747;e during five days, which we &#8747;pent in this romantic country, where we took a view of &#8747;o
<pb n="74"/>
many lakes, this was the only moment, in which we were &#8747;o fortunate, as to &#8747;ee the water in a <i>pure</i>, reflecting &#8747;tate.  Partial exhibitions of this kind we had often met with: but here we were pre&#8747;ented with a &#8747;cene of the utmo&#8747;t magnificence.</p>
<p>Having examined this very lowly land&#8747;cape, &#8747;o perfect both in compo&#8747;ition, and in colouring, we proceeded in our rout along the lake.</p>
<p>We now re-entered Gobray-park; which afforded us, for near three miles, a great variety of beautiful &#8747;cenes on the left, compo&#8747;ed of rocky, and broken-ground, fore&#8747;t-trees, cop&#8747;e-wood, and wooded-hills: while the lake, and mountains, who&#8747;e &#8747;ummits were now glowing with the full &#8747;plendor of an evening &#8747;un, were a continued fund of varied entertainment on the right.  The eye was both amu&#8747;ed, and relieved by &#8747;urveying the two different modes of &#8747;cenery in &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ion: the broad &#8747;hades, and bright diver&#8747;ified tints, of the di&#8747;tant mountains, on one &#8747;ide; and the beautiful forms, and objects of the fore-ground, on the other.</p>
<pb n="75"/>
<p>One part of the fore-ground was marked with &#8747;ingular wildne&#8747;s.  It was a kind of rocky pa&#8747;s near the margin of the lake; known, I believe, by the name <i>Yew-cragg</i>.  If C&#230;&#8747;ar had &#8747;een it, it would have &#8747;truck him in a military light; and he would have de&#8747;cribed it as a defile, "angu&#8747;tum, &amp; difficile, inter montem, &amp; lacum; quo vix &#8747;inguli carri ducerentur.  Mons alti&#8747;&#8747;imus impendebat; ut facile perpauci tra&#8747;itum prohibere po&#8747;&#8747;ent<ptr target="n26"/>."</p>
<note id="n26">C&#230;s. Com. lib. I.</note>
<p>But our imaginations were more amu&#8747;ed with picture&#8747;que, than military ideas.  It &#8747;truck us therefore merely as an object of beauty. -- It's features were the&#8747;e.</p>
<p>At a little di&#8747;tance from the lake, the broken &#8747;ide of a mountain falls abruptly to the ground in two noble tiers of rock; both which are &#8747;hattered in every direction.  This rocky &#8747;cene was ornamented in the riche&#8747;t manner with wood.  The road &#8747;kirted the lake; and between it and the rocks, all was rough, broken-ground, intangled with brakes, and impa&#8747;&#8747;ible.  Among the rocks aro&#8747;e a grove of fore&#8747;t-trees
<pb n="76"/>
of various height, according to the inequality of the ground.  Here and there, a few &#8747;cattered oaks, the fathers of the fore&#8747;t, reared there peeled, and withered trunks acro&#8747;s the glade; and &#8747;et off the vivid green of the more luxuriant trees.  The deer &#8747;tarting from the brakes, as the feet of our hor&#8747;es approached, added new wildne&#8747;s to the native character of the view; while the &#8747;creams of a hernery (the wilde&#8747;t notes in nature) allowed the ear to participate in the &#8747;cene.</p>
<p>The illumination of this grand ma&#8747;s of rock was as intere&#8747;ting, as the compo&#8747;ition of it.  It was over&#8747;pread, when we &#8747;aw it, with a deep evening-&#8747;hadow, with many a darker tint in the clo&#8747;er rece&#8747;&#8747;es.  A mild ray, ju&#8747;t tinged with the blu&#8747;h of a &#8747;etting &#8747;un, tipped the &#8747;ummits of the trees:</p>

<p>Were a man di&#8747;po&#8747;ed to turn hermit, I know not where he could fix his abode more agreeably than here. The projecting rocks would
<pb n="77"/>
afford a &#8747;heltered &#8747;ituation for his cell; which would open to a &#8747;cene every way fitted for meditation.  He might wander along the bottom of a mountain; and by the &#8747;ide of a lake, almo&#8747;t unfrequented, except by the foot of curio&#8747;ity, or of &#8747;ome ha&#8747;ty &#8747;hepherd, &#8747;eeking for the &#8747;tragglers of his flock.  Here he might enjoy the contemplation of nature in all her &#8747;implicity and grandeur.  This &#8747;ingle &#8747;cene, the mere invirons of his cell, under all the varieties of light, and &#8747;hade -- &#8747;un-&#8747;hine, and &#8747;torm -- morning, and evening, would it&#8747;elf afford an inexhau&#8747;ted fund of entertainment: while the ample tome expanded daily before his eye, would bani&#8747;h the littlene&#8747;s of life; and naturally impre&#8747;s his mind with great ideas.</p>
<p>From this wild &#8747;cene we &#8747;oon entered another of a different ca&#8747;t.  It was a circular plain, about half a mile in diameter; &#8747;urrounded by mountains, with an opening to the lake.  The plain was &#8747;mooth, but varied: the mountains, rather low, but rugged.</p>
<pb n="78"/>
<p>A valley, like this, con&#8747;idered as a <i>whole</i>, has little picture&#8747;que beauty.  But a picture&#8747;que eye will find it's objects even here.  It will inve&#8747;tigate the hills, and pick out &#8747;uch portions, as are mo&#8747;t plea&#8747;ing.  The&#8747;e it will form into back-grounds, and inrich the fore-ground (which can only be a plain) with cattle, trees, or other objects. -- Even &#8747;uch &#8747;imple &#8747;cenes, by the aid of judicious lights, may form pictures.</p>
<p>We had the &#8747;ame kind of &#8747;cene, &#8747;oon after, repeated, -- a circular valley, &#8747;urrounded with mountains, tho varied in many particulars from the other.  Both however were equally unadored; and as bother were capable, by a few well-cho&#8747;en accompaniments, of being formed into good pictures; &#8747;o likewise both were capable of being made delightful &#8747;cenes in nature, by a little judicious planting; tho we mu&#8747;t &#8747;till have wi&#8747;hed this planting to have had the growth of a century.</p>
<pb n="79"/>
<p>It is remarkable, that we find &#8747;carce any di&#8747;po&#8747;ition of ground, that belongs to a mountainous country, of which Virgil has not taken notice.  The &#8747;cenes we now examined, he exactly de&#8747;cribes: only he has given his hills the ornament of wood, which he knew was their mo&#8747;t picture&#8747;que dre&#8747;s.</p>

</poem>
<p>Not far from the&#8747;e circular plains appears <i>Gobray-hall</i>; once the capital of the&#8747;e domains; but now a neglected man&#8747;ion.  If &#8747;ituation can recommend a place, this &#8747;eems to enjoy one in great perfection.  It &#8747;tands on high ground, with higher &#8747;till behind it.  We did not ride up to the hou&#8747;e; but it &#8747;eemed to command a noble view of the lake, and of the &#8747;cenery around it.</p>
<p>Nearly at the point where Ulle&#8747;water makes it's la&#8747;t curve, &#8747;tands the village of <i>Water-
<pb n="80"/>
-Mullock</i>; &#8747;ituated rather within the land.  Through this place the road carried us to the la&#8747;t reach of the lake; which is the lea&#8747;t beautiful part.  Here the hills grow &#8747;mooth, and lumpi&#8747;h; and the country, at every &#8747;tep, lo&#8747;es &#8747;ome of the wild &#8747;trokes of nature; and degenerates, if I may &#8747;o &#8747;peak, into cultivation.</p>
<p>At the end of the lake &#8747;tands <i>Dunmallet</i>, a remarkable hill, which overlooks the la&#8747;t reach; but is it&#8747;elf rather a di&#8747;gu&#8747;ting object.  Shaped with conic exactne&#8747;s; planted uniformly with Scotch firs; and cut as uniformly into walks verging to a center, it becomes a vile termination of a noble &#8747;cene. -- Once probably it was more intere&#8747;ting; when the Roman eagle was planted, as it formerly was, upon it's &#8747;ummit -- when it's bold, rough &#8747;ides were in uni&#8747;on with the objects around -- and a noble ca&#8747;tle frowned, from it's precipices over the lake.  This fortre&#8747;s, who&#8747;e ramparts may yet ea&#8747;ily be traced, mu&#8747;t once have been of con&#8747;iderable importance, as it commanded all the avenues of the country.</p>
<pb n="81"/>
<p>We had now fini&#8747;hed our view of Ulle&#8747;water, which contains a wonderful variety of grand, and picture&#8747;que &#8747;cenes, compre&#8747;&#8747;ed within a very narrow compa&#8747;s. -- In one part, not far from Water-Mullock, the road carried us to the higher grounds, from whence we had a view of the whole lake, and all it's va&#8747;t accompaniments together -- a troubled &#8747;ea of mountains; a broken &#8747;cene -- amu&#8747;ing, but not picture&#8747;que.</p>
<p>In our evening's ride, we had &#8747;kirted only one &#8747;ide of the lake; and wi&#8747;hed our time would have allowed us to &#8747;kirt the other al&#8747;o.  It is probable the &#8747;outhern coa&#8747;t might have afforded very noble di&#8747;tant views of the woods, and rocks of Gobray-park, and the adjacent loft grounds.</p>
<p>We could have wi&#8747;hed al&#8747;o to have navigated the lake: for though views from the <i>water</i>, are in general le&#8747;s beautiful, than the &#8747;ame views from the <i>land</i>, as they want the
<pb n="82"/>
advantage of a fore-ground, and al&#8747;o bring the horizon too low<ptr target="n27"/>; yet it is probable the grand reaches of this lake, and the woody promontories, round which the water winds, would have di&#8747;played many beautiful pa&#8747;&#8747;ages from a boat.</p>
<note id="n27">See Page. 96</note>
<p>One view from the water, we heard much commended, that of the la&#8747;t reach of the lake, towards the conic hill of Dunmallet.  The &#8747;ides of the lake -- it's gliding away into the river Eamot, which carries it off -- Poolybridge, which is thrown over that river, at the bottom of the lake -- and the country beyond -- were all much extolled: but we could not conceive, that any views, at this end of the lake, could be comparable to what we had &#8747;een near the &#8747;hores of Patterdale: e&#8747;pecially any views, in which the regular form of Dunmallet made &#8747;o con&#8747;iderable a part.</p>

<p>It would have added al&#8747;o to our amu&#8747;ement, to have taken a view of the lake by moon-

light.  For tho it is very difficult <i>in painting</i> to manage &#8747;o feeble an effu&#8747;ion of light in &#8747;uch a manner, as, at the &#8747;ame time, to <i>illuminate objects</i>, and <i>produce an effect</i>; yet the <i>reality</i>, in &#8747;uch &#8747;cenes as the&#8747;e, is attended often with a wonderful &#8747;olemnity and grandeur.  That &#8747;hadowy form of great objects, which is &#8747;ometimes traced out by a &#8747;ilver thread, and &#8747;ometimes by a kind of bright ob&#8747;curity on a darker ground, almo&#8747;t oppre&#8747;&#8747;es the imagination with &#8747;ublime ideas.  Great effects al&#8747;o we &#8747;ometimes &#8747;ee of light and &#8747;hade, tho only faintly marked.  In the ab&#8747;ence of colour, the clair-ob&#8747;cur is more &#8747;triking;</p>

<p>I cannot leave the &#8747;cenes of Ulle&#8747;water, without taking notice of an uncommon fi&#8747;h, which frequents it's waters; and which is equally the object of the naturali&#8747;t, and of the epicure.  It is of the trout-&#8747;pecies; beautifully clad in &#8747;cales of &#8747;ilver; firm, and finely
<pb n="84"/>
flavoured; and of &#8747;uch dimen&#8747;ions, that it has &#8747;ometimes been known to weigh between thirty, and forty pounds.</p>
<p>Having now pa&#8747;t the limits of the lake, we traver&#8747;ed a very plea&#8747;ant country in our road to Penrith, keeping the Eamot commonly within view on our right; and leaving on the left, the ruins of Dacre-ca&#8747;tle, the ancient &#8747;eat of the noble family of that name.</p>
<p>No part of Cumberland is more inhabited by the genteeler families of the county, than this.  Within the circumference of a few miles &#8747;tand many of their hou&#8747;es; &#8747;ome of which have formerly been ca&#8747;tles: but the road carried us in view only of two or three of them.</p>
<p>Before we arrived at Penrith, one of the&#8747;e fortre&#8747;&#8747;es, which is known by the name of Penrith-ca&#8747;tle, pre&#8747;ented us with a very noble ruin; and under the mo&#8747;t intere&#8747;ting circum&#8747;tances.  The &#8747;un, which, through the length
<pb n="84.1"/>
<gap desc="unclear landscape orientated oval picture"/>
<pb n="85"/>
of a &#8747;ummer-day, had befriended us with all his morning, noon, and evening powers; preparing now, with <i>farewell &#8747;weet</i>, to take his leave, gave us yet one more beautiful exhibition.</p>
<p>A grand broken arch pre&#8747;ented it&#8747;elf fir&#8747;t in deep &#8747;hadow.  Through the aperture appeared a part of the internal &#8747;tructure, thrown into per&#8747;pective to great advantage; and illumined by the departing ray.  Other fragments of the &#8747;hattered towers, and battlements were ju&#8747;t touched with the &#8747;plendid tint: but the body of light re&#8747;ted on tho&#8747;e parts, which were &#8747;een through the &#8747;hadowed arch.</p>
<p>In the offskip, beyond the ca&#8747;tle, aro&#8747;e a hill, in &#8747;hadow likewi&#8747;e; on the top of which &#8747;tood a lonely beacon.  The windows an&#8747;wering each other, we could ju&#8747;t di&#8747;cern the glowing horizon through them -- a circum&#8747;tance, which however trivial in de&#8747;cription, has a beautiful effect in land&#8747;cape.</p>
<p>This beacon is a monument of tho&#8747;e tumultuous times, which preceded the union; and the only monument of the kind now remaining in the&#8747;e parts; though &#8747;uch beacons were formerly &#8747;tationed over the whole country;
<pb n="85.1"/>
<gap desc="unclear landscape orientated oval picture"/>
<pb n="86"/>
and could &#8747;pread intelligence, in a few &#8747;econds, from one end of it to the other.</p>
<p>At this later day the&#8747;e ca&#8747;tles and po&#8747;ts of alarm, adorning the country, they once defended, rai&#8747;e plea&#8747;ing reflections on a compari&#8747;on of pre&#8747;ent times with pa&#8747;t -- tho&#8747;e turbulent times, when no man could &#8747;leep in &#8747;afety unle&#8747;s &#8747;ecured by a fortre&#8747;s.  In war he feared the inva&#8747;ion of an open enemy: and in peace a mi&#8747;chief &#8747;till more formidable, the ravages of banditti; with whom the country was always at that time infe&#8747;ted.  The&#8747;e wretches were compo&#8747;ed of the outlaws from both nations; and inhabiting the fa&#8747;tne&#8747;&#8747;es of the bogs, and mountains, u&#8747;ed to &#8747;ally out, and plunder in all directions.</p>
<p>Penrith is a neat town, &#8747;ituated not unplea&#8747;antly, under mountains; and in the neighbourhood of lakes.</p>
<p>In the church-yard we &#8747;aw an ancient monument, which has occa&#8747;ioned much &#8747;peculation among antiquarians.  It con&#8747;i&#8747;ts of two rough pillars, with four &#8747;emicircular &#8747;tones, fixed in the ground between them.  Dr. Todd, an antiquarian of the la&#8747;t age, found out four
<pb n="87"/>
wild-boards, and other ingenious devices, on the different parts of this monument.  We examined it with attention: but could not find even the mo&#8747;t di&#8747;tant re&#8747;emblance of any form in nature.  The whole &#8747;urface &#8747;eemed to be nothing more than a piece of rough chi&#8747;&#8747;el work. -- In the church, which is a hand&#8747;ome, plain &#8747;tructure, is placed a &#8747;tone, recording the ravages of the plague among the &#8747;everal towns of this neighbourhood, in the year 1598.</p>
<p>As we leave Penrith, which is within twenty miles of Carli&#8747;le, we enter that va&#8747;t wa&#8747;te, called <i>Inglewood-fore&#8747;t</i>, through which we rode at lea&#8747;t nine miles; in all which &#8747;pace there is &#8747;care a tree to be &#8747;een: and yet were it well planted, as it once probably was, many parts of it might be admired: for the ground makes bold and noble &#8747;wells; the back &#8747;cenery is compo&#8747;ed of a grand &#8747;weep of mountains; and on the left, are di&#8747;tant views into a cultivated country.</p>
<p>The mountains, which adorn the&#8747;e &#8747;cenes, are the &#8747;ame we &#8747;aw, as we left Ke&#8747;wick; only the more northern part of that circular
<pb n="88"/>
chain is now turned towards us.  In this view, the ridge of Saddle-back a&#8747;&#8747;umes that &#8747;hape, from which it derives it's appellation.</p>
<p>That part of Inglewood-fore&#8747;t, which lies neare&#8747;t the town, is known by the name of Penrith-fell, con&#8747;i&#8747;ting of rough, and hilly grounds.  One of the highe&#8747;t hills is occupied by the beacon, of which we had a di&#8747;tant view, as we examined the ruins of Penrith-ca&#8747;tle.</p>
<p>On this &#8747;pot, in the year 1715, the Cumberland militia a&#8747;&#8747;embled to oppo&#8747;e the rebels in their march to the &#8747;outh.  But a militia without di&#8747;cipline, is never formidable.  The whole body fled, as the van of the rebels appeared marching round an oppo&#8747;ite hill.</p>
<p>Nicol&#8747;on, bi&#8747;hop of Carli&#8747;le, a &#8747;trenuous man, who had been very in&#8747;trumental in bringing them together, and now attended their march; was &#8747;o chagrined, and mortified at their behaviour, that in a fit of ob&#8747;tinate vexation, he would not quit the field.  The
<pb n="89"/>
enemy was coming on apace.  His &#8747;ervants rode up to the coach for orders.  The bi&#8747;hop &#8747;at mute with indignation.  All thoughts of him&#8747;elf were lo&#8747;t in the public di&#8747;grace.  His coachman however, who&#8747;e feelings were le&#8747;s delicate, thinking the management of affairs, in this interruption of government, now devolved upon him, la&#8747;hed his hor&#8747;es, and carried his ma&#8747;ter off the field.</p>
<p>On the verge of the fore&#8747;t, at a place called Plumpton, a large Roman &#8747;tation (or &#8747;tative camp) runs a quarter of a mile, on the right.  You trace the ground broken variou&#8747;ly, where tents, kitchens, and earthen tables probably &#8747;tood, not unlike the ve&#8747;tiges of a modern encampment.  On the left appear the lines of a &#8747;ort of con&#8747;iderable dimen&#8747;ions, about one hundred and fifty yards &#8747;quare, which was once the citadel of this military colony.  The ramparts, and ditches may ea&#8747;ily be traced on every &#8747;ide.</p>
<p>The great road indeed, which we travelled, is intirely Roman; and is laid almo&#8747;t by a line over the fore&#8747;t.  You &#8747;eldom &#8747;ee a <i>winding</i> road of Roman con&#8747;truction.  Their &#8747;urvey-

ors, and pioneers had no idea of the line of beauty; nor &#8747;tood in reverence of any inclo&#8747;ures; but always took the &#8747;horte&#8747;t cut; making the Appian way the model of all their provincial roads.</p>
<p>At Ragmire, about a mile farther, where the road cro&#8747;&#8747;es a bog, large wooden frameworks, yet uninjured by time, were lately dug up; which the Romans had laid, as a foundation for their cau&#8747;ey, over that un&#8747;table &#8747;urface.</p>
<p>On leaving Inglewood-fore&#8747;t, the road enters an enclo&#8747;ed country, in which is little variety, and &#8747;carce an intere&#8747;ting object, till we arrive at Carli&#8747;le.</p>
<p>The approach to that city, from the ri&#8747;ing ground, near the little village of Hereby, is grand.  The town, which terminates a vi&#8747;ta of a mile in length, takes a very compact form; in which no part is &#8747;een, but what makes a hand&#8747;ome appearance.  The &#8747;quare, and ma&#8747;&#8747;y tower of the ca&#8747;tle ri&#8747;es on the right: in the middle, the cathedral ri&#8747;es &#8747;till
<pb n="91"/>
higher; and contiguous to it, on the left, appear the round towers of the citadel; which was built by Henry VIII, in the form of all his ca&#8747;tles on the Hamp&#8747;hire, and Kenti&#8747;h coa&#8747;ts.</p>
<p>The beauty however of this approach is &#8747;oon lo&#8747;t.  As we de&#8747;cend the hill from Hereby, the town &#8747;inks into the in&#8747;ignificance of it's invirons.</p>
<p>The entrance is &#8747;till beautiful; the road winding to the gate round the towers of the citadel.</p>

<p>FEW towns offer a fairer field to an antiquary, than Carli&#8747;le.  It's origin, and hi&#8747;tory, are remote, curious and ob&#8747;cure.  It was unque&#8747;tionably a place of con&#8747;equence in Roman times.  Severus's wall ju&#8747;t includes it in the Briti&#8747;h pale.  The ve&#8747;tiges of that barrier run within half a mile of it's gates; and it probably figured fir&#8747;t under the character of a fortre&#8747;s, on that celebrated rampart.</p>
<p>In after ages it had it's &#8747;hare &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ively in the hi&#8747;tory of Saxons, Danes, and Cots; and during the revolutions of the&#8747;e &#8747;everal nations, was the &#8747;cene of every vici&#8747;&#8747;itude of war.  It hath been frequently be&#8747;ieged, pillaged, burnt, and rebuilt.  Once it lay buried in it's ruins for the &#8747;pace of two centuries.  Rufus brought it again into exi&#8747;tence.  The pre&#8747;ent town is founded on the ve&#8747;tiges of
<pb n="94"/>
former towns; which in many parts have rai&#8747;ed the ground within, nearly to the height of the walls.  The foundations of a hou&#8747;e are rarely dug without di&#8747;turbing the ruins of &#8747;ome other hou&#8747;e.  It has been the re&#8747;idence; and it has been the pri&#8747;on of kings.  An old a&#8747;h-tree is &#8747;till &#8747;hewn, near the gate of the ca&#8747;tle; which is &#8747;aid to have been planted by the unfortunate Mary of Scotland, who &#8747;pent a part of her captivity in this fortre&#8747;s; whither &#8747;he was &#8747;oon brought, after her landing at Workington.  Many princes al&#8747;o have &#8747;hed their royal favours on this ancient town; and made it's fortifications their care.</p>
<p>Now all it's military honours are di&#8747;graced.  Northern commotions are no longer dreaded.  It's gates &#8747;tand always open; and it's walls, the object of no farther attention, are falling fa&#8747;t into ruin.  The firing of a morning and an evening gun from the ca&#8747;tle, which was the la&#8747;t garri&#8747;on-form that remained, hath been di&#8747;continued the&#8747;e &#8747;ix years, to the great regret of the country around, who&#8747;e hours of labour it regulated.</p>
<pb n="95"/>
<p>But I mean not to enter into the hi&#8747;tory of Carli&#8747;le: it concerns me only as an object of beauty.  Within it's walls indeed it contains little that de&#8747;erves notice.  The ca&#8747;tle is heavy in all it's parts, as the&#8747;e fabrics commonly are.  It is too perfect to afford much plea&#8747;ure to the picture&#8747;que eye; excepts as a remote object, &#8747;oftened by di&#8747;tance.  Hereafter, when it's &#8747;hattered towers, and buttre&#8747;&#8747;es, give a lightne&#8747;s to it's parts, it may adorn &#8747;ome future land&#8747;cape.</p>
<p>The cathedral de&#8747;erves &#8747;till le&#8747;s attention.  It is a heavy, Saxon pile; and there is nothing about it, that is beautiful; except the ea&#8747;t-window, which is a rich, and very elegant piece of Gothic ramification.</p>
<p>The <i>fratry</i>, as it is called, or chapter-hou&#8747;e, in the abbey, is the only building that de&#8747;erves notice.  On one &#8747;ide, where it has formerly been connected with the cloy&#8747;ters, it has little beauty: but on the other, next the deanery, it's proportions and ornaments are elegant.  It &#8747;eems to be of that &#8747;tyle of architecture, which prevailed rather before the two later Henries.</p>
<pb n="96"/>
<p>But thought Carli&#8747;le furni&#8747;hes little amu&#8747;ement within it's walls; yet it adds great beauty, as a di&#8747;tant object, to the country around.  Few towns enjoy a better &#8747;ituation.  It &#8747;tands on a ri&#8747;ing ground, in the mid&#8747;t of meadows, watered by two con&#8747;iderable rivers; which flowing on different &#8747;ides of the city, unite a little below it; and form the whole ground-plot, on which it &#8747;tands, into a kind of penin&#8747;ula.  Beyond the meadows, the ground ri&#8747;es, in almo&#8747;t all parts, at different di&#8747;tances.</p>
<p>The meadows around it, e&#8747;pecially along the banks of the river Eden, want only a little more woods to make them very beautiful.  In high floods, which happen two or three times in the cour&#8747;e of a winter, they exhibit a very grand &#8747;cene.  The town appears &#8747;tanding out, like a promontory in the mid&#8747;t of a va&#8747;t lake.</p>
<p>The &#8747;hort &#8747;iege which Carli&#8747;le &#8747;u&#8747;tained in the rebellion of the year 1745, together with &#8747;ome awkward circum&#8747;tances that attended it, threw
<pb n="97"/>
a general odium upon the town; and many believed, among whom was the late duke of Cumberland, that it was very ill-affected to the government.  No &#8747;u&#8747;picion was ever more unju&#8747;t.  I dare take upon me to &#8747;ay, there were &#8747;carce half a dozen people in the whole place, who wi&#8747;hed well to the rebellion.</p>
<p>The following anecdote, known but to few; and totally unknown, till many years after the event, will throw &#8747;ome light on it's ha&#8747;ty &#8747;urrender; which brought it into &#8747;uch di&#8747;grace.</p>
<p>When the rebels came before it, it was garri&#8747;oned only by two companies of invalids; and two raw, undi&#8747;ciplined regiments of militia.  General Wade lay at Newca&#8747;tle with a con&#8747;iderable force: and the governor of Carli&#8747;le informing him, how unprovided he was, begged a reinforcement.  The &#8747;ingle hope of this relief, enabled the gentlemen of the country, who commanded the militia, to keep their men under arms.</p>
<p>In the mean time the rebels were known to be as ill-prepared for an attack, as the town was for a defence.  They had now lain a week before it; and found it was impracticable, for
<pb n="98"/>
want of artillery, to make any attempt.  They feared al&#8747;o an interruption from general Wade: and be&#8747;ides, were unwilling to delay any longer their march towards London.  Under the&#8747;e difficulties, they had come to a re&#8747;olution to abandon their de&#8747;ign.</p>
<p>At this critical time the governor of Carli&#8747;le received a letter from general Wade, informing him, he was &#8747;o circum&#8747;tanced, that he could not po&#8747;&#8747;ibly &#8747;end the reinforcement that had been de&#8747;ired.  This mortifying intelligence, tho not publickly known, was however communicated to the principal officers; and to &#8747;ome others; among whom was a bu&#8747;y attorney, who&#8747;e name was H----s.</p>
<p>H----s was then addre&#8747;&#8747;ing a young lady, the daughter of Mr. F----r, a gentleman of the country; and to a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;t his cau&#8747;e, and give him&#8747;elf con&#8747;equence with his intended father in law, he whi&#8747;pered to him, among his other political &#8747;ecrets, the di&#8747;appointment from general Wade.</p>
<p>The whi&#8747;per did not re&#8747;t here.  F----r frequented a club in the neighbourhood; where ob&#8747;erving (in the jollity of a chearful evening) that only friends were pre&#8747;ent, he gave his company the information, he had ju&#8747;t received from H----s.</p>
<pb n="99"/>
<p>There was in that company, one S----d, a gentleman of &#8747;ome fortune near Carli&#8747;le, who, tho a known papi&#8747;t, was however at that time, thought to be of very intire affection to the government.  This man, po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ed of &#8747;uch a &#8747;ecret, and wi&#8747;hing for an opportunity to &#8747;erve a cau&#8747;e, which he favoured in his heart, took hor&#8747;e that very night, after he left the club-room, and rode directly to the rebel-camp; which he found under orders to break up the next morning.  He was carried immediately to the Duke of Perth, and others of the rebel leaders, to whom he communicated his intelligence; and a&#8747;&#8747;ured them, they might expect a mutiny in the town, if they continued before it, one day longer.  Counter orders were immediately i&#8747;&#8747;ued; and the next day the Cumberland and We&#8747;tmoreland militia, being under no di&#8747;cipline, began to mutiny, and di&#8747;per&#8747;e; and the town defended now only by two companies of invalids, was thought no longer tenable.  The governor was tried by a court-martial; and acquitted: and nobody &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed that either the militia-officers, or their men, were impre&#8747;&#8747;ed by an motive wor&#8747;e than fear.</p>

<p>In &#8747;o variegated a country, as England, there are few parts, which do not afford many plea&#8747;ing, and picture&#8747;que &#8747;cenes.  The mo&#8747;t probably way of finding them, as I ob&#8747;erved a little above, is to follow the cour&#8747;e of the rivers.  About their banks we &#8747;hall generally find the riche&#8747;t &#8747;cenery, which the country can produce.  This rule we followed in the few excur&#8747;ions which we had time to make from Carli&#8747;le: and fir&#8747;t we took a view of the river Cauda.</p>
<p>Near the town this river is broken into &#8747;o many &#8747;treams; and throws up, every where, &#8747;o many barren beds of pebbles, that there is no great beauty in this part of it's cour&#8747;e.  But above, where higher banks confine it's impetuo&#8747;ity, it becomes more intere&#8747;ting.  The vales of Sebergham and Dal&#8747;ton, we heard much commended.  The former we did not vi&#8747;it: the latter we followed with great plea&#8747;ure, along it's winding cour&#8747;e, for many miles; and found our&#8747;elves often in the mid&#8747;t of very beautiful &#8747;cenes; the river being &#8747;hut up &#8747;ometimes
<pb n="101"/>
by clo&#8747;e, and lofty banks, and &#8747;ometimes flowing through meadows edged with wood.</p>
<p>Among other &#8747;ituations on the Cauda we were much plea&#8747;ed with that of Ro&#8747;e-ca&#8747;tle, the &#8747;eat of the bi&#8747;hop of Carli&#8747;le; which &#8747;tands on a gentle ri&#8747;e, in a wide part of the vale; the river winding round it, in a &#8747;emi-circular form, at about half a mile's di&#8747;tance.  The ground between the ca&#8747;tle, and the river, con&#8747;i&#8747;ts of beautiful meadows; and beyond the river, the lofty bank, which winds with it, is well-planted; and forms a &#8747;weep of hanging wood.  The ca&#8747;tle compo&#8747;ed of &#8747;quare towers, tho no object on the &#8747;pot, is a good ornament to the &#8747;cene.</p>
<p>Between Ro&#8747;e-ca&#8747;tle and Wigton the country abounds with the relicks of Roman incampments.  At a place, called Chalk-cliff (which, by the way, is a cliff of red &#8747;tone) this lefionary in&#8747;cription is engraved in the native rock.</p>

<p>From the Cauda, our next excur&#8747;ion was along the Eden.  On the banks of this river, we were informed of many intere&#8747;ting &#8747;cenes.  At Kirko&#8747;wal, and Nunnery particularly, the country was repre&#8747;ented as very engaging; but Corby-ca&#8747;tle, about five miles from Carli&#8747;le, was the only place above the town, which we had time to vi&#8747;it.</p>
<p>At Wetherall we ferried over the river; and landed under the ca&#8747;tle, which &#8747;tands on the edge of a lofty bank.  This bank &#8747;tretches at lea&#8747;t three miles along the cour&#8747;e of the river, partly below, but chiefly above, the ca&#8747;tle.  I give it it's ancient title; tho it is now a mere modern hou&#8747;e, without the lea&#8747;t ve&#8747;tige of it's primeval dignity.  Below the ca&#8747;tle, the bank is rocky, and falls precipitately into the water: above, it makes a more gentle de&#8747;cent; and leaves an edging, which, in &#8747;ome parts, &#8747;preads into little winding meads, and where it is narrowe&#8747;t, is broad enough for a hand&#8747;ome walk.  The whole bank, both above, and below the ca&#8747;tle, is covered with wood; large oak, and a&#8747;h; and in many places the &#8747;cenery is rocky al&#8747;o.  But the rocks are not of the grey kind,
<pb n="103"/>
&#8747;tained with a variety of different tints -- the <i>&#8747;axa circumlita mu&#8747;co</i>; but incline rather to a &#8747;andy red, which is not the mo&#8747;t coale&#8747;cing hue.  They give however great &#8747;pirit, and beauty to the &#8747;cene.</p>
<p>The bank of the river, <i>oppo&#8747;ite</i> to the ca&#8747;tle, is likewi&#8747;e high; in many parts woody; in others affording an intermixture of wood, and lawn.  Here &#8747;tand the ruins of Wetherall-abbey; tho little more of it is left, than a &#8747;quare tower, which is &#8747;ome ornament, tho no very picture&#8747;que one, to the &#8747;cene.  The&#8747;e ruins were once exten&#8747;ive, and, I have heard, beautiful; but the dean and chapter of Carli&#8747;le, to whom the place belongs, &#8747;ome years ago carried off the &#8747;tones, with more &#339;conomy than ta&#8747;te, to build a prebendal hou&#8747;e.</p>
<p>On this &#8747;ide of the river al&#8747;o, an object pre&#8747;ents it&#8747;elf, known by the name of <i>Wetherall-&#8747;afeguard</i>, which is e&#8747;teemed a great curio&#8747;ity.  It con&#8747;i&#8747;ts of three chambers cut in the &#8747;olid rock, which being in this part, almo&#8747;t a precipice, the acce&#8747;s to the&#8747;e chambers is very difficult.  It is &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed to have been an appendage of the abbey; where the monks, in times of di&#8747;order, &#8747;ecreted their wealth.  Some antiquarians &#8747;uppo&#8747;e it to have been
<pb n="104"/>
inhabited by a religious devotee, and call it <i>St. Con&#8747;tantine's cell</i>.  It is rather a curious place, than any great ornament to the &#8747;cene.</p>
<p>To the natural advantages of the &#8747;cenery about Corby-ca&#8747;tle, the improvements of art have added little.  The late proprietor, who had &#8747;een nothing him&#8747;elf; and imagined from the re&#8747;ort of &#8747;trangers to &#8747;ee the beauty of his &#8747;ituation, that they admired his ta&#8747;te, re&#8747;olved to make Corby one of the mo&#8747;t &#8747;umptuous placed in Europe.  With this view, he &#8747;cooped his rocks into grottos -- fabricated a ca&#8747;cade, con&#8747;i&#8747;ting of a lofty flight of regular &#8747;tone &#8747;teps -- cut a &#8747;traight walk through his woods, along the banks of the river; at the end of which he reared a temple: and being re&#8747;olved to add every ornament, that expence could procure, he hired an arti&#8747;t of the country, at four-pence a day (for labour was then cheap) to make &#8747;tatues.  Numberle&#8747;s were the works of this genius.  Diana, Neptune, Polyphemus, Nymphs and Satyrs in abundance, and a variety of other figures, became &#8747;oon the ornaments of the woods; and met the eye of the &#8747;pectator wherever he turned.  A pun&#8747;ter, who was remarkable for making only one good pun in his life, made it here.  Pointing to one of the&#8747;e
<pb n="105"/>
&#8747;trange figures, he called it <i>a &#8747;atyr upon the place</i>.</p>
<p>But the ta&#8747;te of the pre&#8747;ent age hath de&#8747;troyed the pride of the la&#8747;t.  The pre&#8747;ent proprietor hath done well.  The rocks indeed &#8747;cooped into holes, can never be re&#8747;tored to their native &#8747;implicity, and grandeur.  Their bold projections are for ever effaced.  Nor could a century re&#8747;tore tho&#8747;e trees which were rooted up to form the vi&#8747;ta.  But the &#8747;tatues, like the ancient &#8747;culpture of the Egyptians, are now no more.  The temple is going fa&#8747;t into ruins and the ca&#8747;cade (&#8747;o frivolous, if it had even been good in it's kind, on the banks of a great, and rapid river) is now overgrown with thickets.  The old line of the walk could not ea&#8747;ily be effaced: but a new one, beyond the temple, is carried on, which follows naturally the cour&#8747;e of the river.  And indeed this part of the walk admits more beauty, than any other; for the varieties of ground are greater; the bank, and edging of meadow, are more irregular; and the river more &#8747;inuous.</p>
<pb n="106"/>
<p>The path having conducted us along the river, through the&#8747;e plea&#8747;ing <unclear>irregularities</unclear> about two miles from the ca&#8747;tle, <unclear>climbs to</unclear> higher grounds, and returns through <unclear/> and beautiful &#8747;heep walks, which lie <unclear>on the</unclear> &#8747;ides, and &#8747;ummit of the banks.</p>
<p>Through the whole of this walk, both at the top, and bottom, are many plea&#8747;ant views; but they are all of the more confined kind.</p>
<p>Many parts of this walk were wrought by the manual labour of the prie&#8747;t of the family, which is a popi&#8747;h branch of the Howards.  He belongs to an order, which injoins it's members to work in the ground &#8747;o many hour a day; laying them, with admirable wi&#8747;dom, under the whole&#8747;ome nece&#8747;&#8747;ity of acquiring health and &#8747;pirits.  I am per&#8747;uaded, that if a &#8747;tudious man were <i>obliged</i> to dig three or four hours a day, he would &#8747;tudy the better, during the remaining part of it.  We had been recommended to the civilities of this eccle&#8747;ia&#8747;tic (the family being then in France,) and found him at work in the garden.  He received us politely; and di&#8747;covered the manners of a gentleman, under the garb of a day-labourer, without the lea&#8747;t apology for his dre&#8747;s, and occupation.  There is &#8747;omething very plea&#8747;ing
<pb n="107"/>
in the &#8747;implicity and manline&#8747;s of not being a&#8747;hamed of the nece&#8747;&#8747;ary functions of any &#8747;tate, which we have made our option in life. -- This eccle&#8747;ia&#8747;tic &#8747;ucceeded Father Wal&#8747;h, who has lately engaged the attention of the public. -- I have dwelt the longer on this &#8747;cene, as it is the mo&#8747;t admired one in Cumberland.</p>
<p>From Corby-ca&#8747;tle to Warwick, which lies about two miles nearer Carli&#8747;le, on the banks of the &#8747;ame river, the road is beautiful.  Many admire the &#8747;ituation of Warwick al&#8747;o.  It &#8747;eems to be a &#8747;weet, retired &#8747;cene; but we had not time to view it.</p>
<p>The antiquarian's eye is immediately caught here by the pari&#8747;h-church; the chancel of which, forming the &#8747;egment of a circle, and being pierced with &#8747;mall lancet-windows, &#8747;hews at once, that it is of Norman origin.  Tho every other mark were obliterated, he will tell you, that this is evidence &#8747;ufficient of it's antiquity.</p>

<p>HAVING &#8747;een as much of the river Eden, above Carli&#8747;le, as our time would allow, we made our next excur&#8747;ion towards it's mouth, where Brugh-mar&#8747;h attracted our attention.  In our way we had many plea&#8747;ing river views.</p>
<p>Brugh-mar&#8747;h lies at the extremity of the Engli&#8747;h border; running up as far as Solway-frith, which, in this part, divides England from Scotland.  It is a va&#8747;t extended plain, flat as the &#8747;urface of a quiet ocean.  I do not remember that land, every gave me before &#8747;o va&#8747;t an idea of &#8747;pace.  The idea of this kind, which &#8747;uch &#8747;cenes as Sali&#8747;bury-Plain &#8747;ugge&#8747;ts, is much le&#8747;s pure.  The inequality of the ground there, &#8747;ets bounds to the idea.  It is
<pb n="110"/>
the ocean in a &#8747;torm; in which the idea of exten&#8747;ion is greatly broken, and intercepted by the turbulence of the waves.  Brugh-mar&#8747;h indeed gives us the idea of &#8747;olid water, rather than of land, if we except only the colour:</p>

</poem>
<p>Brugh-mar&#8747;h is one of tho&#8747;e extended plains, (only more exten&#8747;ive, than &#8747;uch plains commonly are) from which the &#8747;ea, in a cour&#8747;e of ages, hath retired.  It is difficult to compute it's limits.  It ranges many leagues, in every direction, from a centre (for &#8747;pace &#8747;o diffu&#8747;e a&#8747;&#8747;umes of cour&#8747;e a circular appearance) without a hedge, or even a bu&#8747;h, to intercept it's bounds; till it &#8747;oftens into the azure mountains of the horizon.  Nothing indeed, but mountains, can circum&#8747;cribe &#8747;uch a &#8747;cene.  All inferior boundaries of woods, and ri&#8747;ing grounds are lo&#8747;t.  On the Engli&#8747;h &#8747;ide it is bounded by that circular chain, in the heart of Cumberland, in which Skiddaw is pre-eminent.  Nothing intermediate appears.  On the Scotch &#8747;ide it's cour&#8747;e is interrupted, through the &#8747;pace of a few leagues, by Solway-
<pb n="111"/>
frith; which &#8747;preads, when the tide is at ebb, into a va&#8747;t &#8747;tretch of &#8747;and. The plain however is &#8747;till pre&#8747;erved: and having pa&#8747;&#8747;ed this &#8747;andy ob&#8747;truction, it changes it's hue again into vivid green, and &#8747;tretches far and wide into the Scotch border, till it's progre&#8747;s at length is &#8747;topped by the mountains of Galloway, and Nidd&#8747;dale.  This exten&#8747;ion is as much as the eye can well comprehend.  Had the plain been boundle&#8747;s, like an Arabian de&#8747;ert, I know not whether it would not have lo&#8747;t that idea of &#8747;pace, which &#8747;o va&#8747;t a circum&#8747;cription gives it.</p>
<p>The whole area of Brugh-mar&#8747;h, (which from it's <i>denomination</i> we &#8747;hould &#8747;uppo&#8747;e to be &#8747;wampy,) is every where perfectly firm; and the turf, &#8747;oft, bright, and pure.  Scarce a weed rears it's head.  Nothing appears of &#8747;tatelier growth, than a mu&#8747;hroom, which &#8747;preads here in very luxuriant knots.</p>
<p>This va&#8747;t plain is far from being a de&#8747;ert wa&#8747;te.  Innumerable herds of cattle pa&#8747;ture at large in it's rich verdure, and range, as in a &#8747;tate of nature.</p>
<pb n="112"/>
<p>But tho the primary idea, which this &#8747;cene pre&#8747;ents, ari&#8747;es purely from &#8747;pace, and is therefore an idea rather grand than picture&#8747;que; yet is it not totally incapable of picture&#8747;que embelli&#8747;hment.  It is true, it wants almo&#8747;t every ingredient of land&#8747;cape; on the fore-ground, it wants objects to pre&#8747;erve the keeping; and in the offskip, that profu&#8747;ion of little parts, which in a &#8747;cene of cultivation gives richne&#8747;s to di&#8747;tance.  In treating therefore a &#8747;ubject of this kind on canvas, recour&#8747;e mu&#8747;t be had to adventitious objects.  Cattle come mo&#8747;t naturally to hand; which being &#8747;tationed, in various groups, at different di&#8747;tances, may &#8747;erve both as a fore-ground to the land&#8747;cape, and as a gage to the per&#8747;pective.</p>
<p>Brugh-mar&#8747;h is farther remarkable for having been the &#8747;cene of one of the greate&#8747;t cata&#8747;trophes of the Engli&#8747;h hi&#8747;tory -- the death of Edward the I.  Here, after the third revolt of Scotland, that prince, drew together the mo&#8747;t pui&#8747;&#8747;ant army, which England had ever &#8747;een.  The Scots from their borders, &#8747;aw the whole plain whitened with tents: but they
<pb n="113"/>
knew not how nearly their deliverance approached.  The greate&#8747;t events generally arrive unlooked for.  They &#8747;aw a delay; and afterwards a confu&#8747;ion in the mighty ho&#8747;t before them; but they heard not, till three days after, that the &#8747;oul, and &#8747;pirit of the enterprize was gone; and that their great adver&#8747;ary lay breathle&#8747;s in his camp.</p>
<p>Edward had been taken ill at Carli&#8747;le; where he had met his parliament.  But neither di&#8747;ea&#8747;e, nor age (for he was now near &#8747;eventy) could repre&#8747;s his ardour.  Tho he could not mount his hor&#8747;e, he ordered him&#8747;elf to be carried in a litter to the camp; where the troops received him with acclamations of joy.  But it was &#8747;hort-lived.  The motion had irritated his di&#8747;order into a violent dy&#8747;entery; which immediately carried him off.</p>
<p>The Engli&#8747;h borderers long revered the memory of a prince, who had &#8747;o often cha&#8747;ti&#8747;ed an enemy, they hated: and in gratitude reared a pillar to his name; which &#8747;till te&#8747;tifies the &#8747;pot, on which he died.  It &#8747;tands rather on

the edge of the mar&#8747;h, and bears this &#8747;imple in&#8747;cription.</p>

<p>Among other places in the neighbourhood of Carli&#8747;le, we made an excur&#8747;ion into Gills-land, with an intention chiefly to &#8747;ee Naworth-ca&#8747;tle, the vale and ruins of the Abbey of Lanerco&#8747;t; and the ruins of Scaleby-ca&#8747;tle.</p>
<p>As we leave Carli&#8747;le, along the great military road to Newca&#8747;tle, the view of the river Eden from Stanwix-bank, is very plea&#8747;ing.  The curve it de&#8747;cribes; the beautiful meadows it winds through; and the mountains, which clo&#8747;e the &#8747;cene, make all together a very amu&#8747;ing combination of objects.  Wood only is wanting.</p>
<pb n="115"/>
<p>On cro&#8747;&#8747;ing the river Irthing, about &#8747;even miles from Carli&#8747;le, the country, which was before unplea&#8747;ing, becomes rich, and intere&#8747;ting.  Here we enter the barony of Gill&#8747;land, an exten&#8747;ive di&#8747;trict, which con&#8747;i&#8747;ts, in this part, of a great variety of hill, and dale.  The hills are &#8747;andy, bleak, and unplea&#8747;ant: but the vallies, which are commonly of the contracted kind, are beautiful.  They are generally woody, and each of them watered by &#8747;ome little bu&#8747;y &#8747;tream. -- From the&#8747;e vallies, or <i>gills</i>, (as the country-people call them,) with which the whole barony abounds, Campden &#8747;uppo&#8747;es it to have taken the name of Gill&#8747;land.</p>
<p>On a delightful knoll, gently gliding into a &#8747;inuous <i>gill</i>, &#8747;urrounded with full-grown oak, and overlooking the vale of Lanerco&#8747;t, &#8747;tands Naworth-ca&#8747;tle.  The hou&#8747;e, which con&#8747;i&#8747;ts of two large &#8747;quare towers, united by a main body, is too regular to be beautiful, unle&#8747;s thrown into per&#8747;pective.  It was formerly one of tho&#8747;e fortified places, in which
<pb n="116"/>
the nobility and gentry of the borders were obliged to live, in tho&#8747;e times of confu&#8747;ion, which preceded the union.  And indeed the whole internal contrivance of this ca&#8747;tle appears calculated either to keep an enemy out; or to elude his &#8747;earch, if he &#8747;hould happen to get in.  The idea of a comfortable dwelling has been totally excluded.  The &#8747;tate-rooms are few, and ordinary: but the little apartments, and hiding holes, acce&#8747;&#8747;ible only by dark pa&#8747;&#8747;ages, and blind &#8747;tair-ca&#8747;es, are innumerable.  Many of the clo&#8747;e rece&#8747;&#8747;es, which it contains, are probably at this time, unknown.  Nothing indeed can mark in &#8747;tronger colours the fears, and jealou&#8747;ies, and caution of tho&#8747;e times, than the internal &#8747;tructure of one of the&#8747;e ca&#8747;tles.</p>
<p>Naworth-ca&#8747;tle was formerly the capital man&#8747;ion of the barons of Gill&#8747;land; who, at &#8747;o great a di&#8747;tance from court, and &#8747;eated in a country, at that time, untamed by law, are &#8747;aid to have exerci&#8747;ed very extraordinary powers.  The Lord William Howard, who is remembered by the name of <i>bald Willy</i>, is &#8747;till the object of invective for his acts of tyranny.  His pri&#8747;ons are &#8747;hewn; and the &#8747;ite of his gibbets; where, in the phra&#8747;e of
<pb n="117"/>
the country, he would <i>head, and hang <unclear>with</unclear> out judge, or jury.</i> -- But it is probable, that his memory is injured.  He acted under a &#8747;tanding commi&#8747;&#8747;ion of oyer, and terminer from Elizabeth; and was one of tho&#8747;e bold &#8747;pirits, which are nece&#8747;&#8747;ary to repre&#8747;s the violence of lawle&#8747;s times.  Many acts of power undoubtedly he committed: but his difficult &#8747;ituation compelled him.  This part of the kingdom was mo&#8747;t hara&#8747;&#8747;ed by tho&#8747;e troops of mi&#8747;chievous banditti; whom I have ju&#8747;t had occa&#8747;ion to mention.  They were a numerous, and not an ill-regulated, body; acting under leaders, whom a &#8747;pirit of enterprize rai&#8747;ed to power.  The&#8747;e mi&#8747;creants, in times even of profounde&#8747;t peace, called for all the warine&#8747;s and activity of the chiefs of the country.  Sometimes they would plunder in large bodies; and &#8747;ometimes in little pilfering bands.  When they were taken in the fact; or, as it was called, by the <i>bloody hand</i>, they were put to in&#8747;tant death.  In other ca&#8747;es a jury impannelled.</p>
<p>The active chief, who gave occa&#8747;ion to this digre&#8747;&#8747;ion, &#8747;eems to have lived in as much terror him&#8747;elf, as he &#8747;pread among others.  He had contrived a &#8747;ort of citadel in his own
<pb n="118"/>
ca&#8747;tle; a room, which is &#8747;till &#8747;hewn, with an iron door, where he con&#8747;tantly &#8747;lept, and where his armour lies ru&#8747;ting to this day.  From him the earls of Carli&#8747;le are de&#8747;cended; and have been, in succe&#8747;&#8747;ion, the proprietors of Naworth-ca&#8747;tle.</p>
<p>As we left this old fortre&#8747;s, and de&#8747;cended the hill towards the ruins of the abbey of Lanerco&#8747;t, which lie about two miles farther, the whole vale, in which they are &#8747;eated, opened before us.  It is e&#8747;teemed one of the &#8747;weete&#8747;t &#8747;cenes in this country; and indeed we found it &#8747;uch.  It's area is about half a mile in breadth, and two or three miles in length, con&#8747;i&#8747;ting of one ample &#8747;weep.  The &#8747;ides, which are gentle declivities, are covered thick with wood, in which larger depredations have been lately made, than are con&#8747;i&#8747;tent with picture&#8747;que beauty. -- At the di&#8747;tant end of the vale, where the woods appear to unite, the river Irthing enters; which is con&#8747;iderable enough, tho divided into two channels, to be fully adequate to the &#8747;cene. -- The banks of the river, and indeed the whole area of the vale, are &#8747;prinkled with clumps,
<pb n="119"/>
and &#8747;ingle trees; which have a good effect in breaking the lines, and regular continuity of the &#8747;ide-&#8747;creens; and in hiding, here and there, the cour&#8747;e of the river; and e&#8747;pecially the bridges, which would otherwi&#8747;e be too bare and formal.</p>
<p>Near that extremity of the vale, which is oppo&#8747;ite to Naworth-ca&#8747;tle, lies the abbey.  At a di&#8747;tance it forms a good object, ri&#8747;ing among the woods.  As you approach, it begins to rai&#8747;e a di&#8747;appointment: and the &#8747;pot, it is but an unplea&#8747;ing ruin.  The whole is a heavy, Saxon pile; compre&#8747;&#8747;ed together without any of that airy lightne&#8747;s, which accompanies the Gothic.  Scarce one <i>detached</i> fragment appears in any point of view.  The tower is low, and without either form, or ornament; and one of the great ailes is modernized into an awkward pari&#8747;h-church.  The only beautiful part of the whole is the ea&#8747;t end.  It is compo&#8747;ed of four broken ailes; every wall of which con&#8747;i&#8747;ts of two tiers of arches, affording, a very unu&#8747;ual appearance; and at the &#8747;ame time a very amu&#8747;ing confu&#8747;ion, from the uncommon multiplication of &#8747;o many arches, and pillars. -- This part of the abbey &#8747;eeems to have been a &#8747;eparate
<pb n="120"/>
chapel; or perhaps an oratory belonging to the noble family of Dacre, which had once po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ions in the&#8747;e parts.  Here lie the remains of &#8747;everal ancient chiefs of that hou&#8747;e; who&#8747;e &#8747;epulchral honours are now almo&#8747;t intirely obliterated.  Their blazoned arms, and Gothic tombs, many of which are &#8747;umptuous, are &#8747;o matted with briars, and thi&#8747;tles, that even the foot of curio&#8747;ity is kept at a di&#8747;tance.</p>
<p>Except the&#8747;e remains of the abbey-church no other parts of this ancient mona&#8747;tery are now left; except an old gateway; and a &#8747;quare building, patched into a farm-hou&#8747;e, which has no beauty.</p>
<p>In returning to Carli&#8747;le we pa&#8747;&#8747;ed through the valley of Cambeck, which contains &#8747;ome plea&#8747;ing &#8747;cenery; and a very con&#8747;iderable Roman &#8747;tation, on a high bank at <i>Ca&#8747;tle-&#8747;teeds</i>.</p>
<p>Rivers often pre&#8747;ent uys with very moral analogies; their characters greatly re&#8747;embling tho&#8747;e of men.  The violent, the re&#8747;tle&#8747;s, the <unclear></unclear>, the active, the &#8747;luggi&#8747;h, the gentle, <unclear></unclear>, and many other epithets, be-<unclear></unclear> to both.  The little &#8747;tream, 
<pb n="120.1"/>
<gap desc="unclear landscape orientated oval picture"/>
<pb n="121"/>
which divides the valley of Cambeck, &#8747;ugge&#8747;ted the analogy.  It's whole cour&#8747;e is marked with acts of violence.  In every part you &#8747;ee heaps of barren &#8747;and, and gravel, which in it's furious moods it has thrown up, &#8747;ometimes on one &#8747;ide, and &#8747;ometimes on another; de&#8747;troying every where the little &#8747;cenes of beauty, and plots of cultivation.</p>
<p>About three miles further &#8747;tand the ruins of Scaleby-ca&#8747;tle.  This was another of tho&#8747;e fortified hou&#8747;es, which are &#8747;o frequent in this country.</p>
<p>It &#8747;tands, as ca&#8747;tles rarely do, on a flat; and yet, tho it's &#8747;ite be ill-adapted to any modes of defence, it has been a place of more than ordinary &#8747;trength.  Rocks, knolls, and bold, projecting promontories, on which ca&#8747;tle u&#8747;ually &#8747;tand, &#8747;ugge&#8747;t various advantages of &#8747;ituation; and generally determine the kind of &#8747;tructure.  On a flat, the engineer was at liberty to choo&#8747;e his own.  Every part was alike open to a&#8747;&#8747;ault.</p>
<p>He fir&#8747;t drew two circular motes round the &#8747;pot he de&#8747;igned to fortify: the circumference of the outward circle was about a mile.
<pb n="122"/>
The earth, thrown out of the&#8747;e two motes, which were broad and deep, &#8747;eems to have been heaped up at the centre, where there is a con&#8747;iderable ri&#8747;e.  On this was built the ca&#8747;tle, which was entered by two draw-bridges; and defended by a high tower, and a very lofty wall.</p>
<p>At pre&#8747;ent, one of the motes only remains.  The other is filled up; but may &#8747;till be traced.  The ca&#8747;tle is more perfect, than &#8747;uch buildings commonly are.  The walls are very intire; and great part of the tower, which is &#8747;quare, is &#8747;till left.  It pre&#8747;erved it's perfect form, till the civil wars of the la&#8747;t century; when the ca&#8747;tle, in too much confidence of it's &#8747;trength, &#8747;hut it's gates again&#8747;t Cromwell, then marching into Scotland; who made it a monument of his vengeance.</p>
<p>What &#8747;hare of picture&#8747;que genius Cromwell might have, I know not.  Certain however it is, that no man, &#8747;ince Henry the eighth, has contributed more to adorn this country with picture&#8747;que ruins.  The difference between the&#8747;e two ma&#8747;ters lay chiefly in the &#8747;tyle of ruins, in which they compo&#8747;ed.  Henry adorned his land&#8747;capes with the ruins of abbeys; Cromwell, with tho&#8747;e ca&#8747;tles.
<pb n="123"/>
I have &#8747;een many pieces by this ma&#8747;ter, executed in a very grand &#8747;tyle; but &#8747;eldom a finer monument of his ma&#8747;terly hand than this.  He has rent the tower, and demoli&#8747;hed two of it's &#8747;ides; the edges of the other two he has &#8747;hattered into broken lines.  The cha&#8747;m di&#8747;covers the whole plan of the internal &#8747;tructure -- the ve&#8747;tiges of the &#8747;everal &#8747;tories -- the in&#8747;ertion of the arches, which &#8747;upported them -- the windows for &#8747;peculation; and the brea&#8747;twork for a&#8747;&#8747;ault.</p>
<p>The walls of this ca&#8747;tle are uncommonly magnificent.  They are not only of great height, but of great thickne&#8747;s; and defended by a large ba&#8747;tion; which appears to be of more modern workman&#8747;hip.  The greate&#8747;t part of them is chambered within, and wrought into &#8747;ecret rece&#8747;&#8747;es.  A ma&#8747;&#8747;y portcullis gate leads to the ruins of what was once the habitable part of the ca&#8747;tle, in which a large vaulted hall is the mo&#8747;t remarkable apartment; and under it, are dark, and capacious dungeons.</p>
<p>The area within the mote, which con&#8747;i&#8747;ts of &#8747;everal acres, was originally intended to &#8747;upport the cattle, which &#8747;hould be driven thither in times of alarm.  When the hou&#8747;e
<pb n="124"/>
was inhabited, (who&#8747;e chearful and better days are &#8747;till remembered,) this area was the garden; and all around, on the out&#8747;ide of the mote &#8747;tood noble trees, irregularly planted, the growth of a century.  Beneath the trees ran a walk round the ca&#8747;tle; to which the &#8747;ituation naturally gave that plea&#8747;ing curve, which in modern days hath been &#8747;o much the object of art.  This walk might admit of great embelli&#8747;hment.  On one hand, it commands the ruins of the ca&#8747;tle in every point of view; on the other, a country, which, tho flat, is not unplea&#8747;ing; con&#8747;i&#8747;ting of exten&#8747;ive meadows, (which a little planting would turn into beautiful lawns,) bounded by lofty mountains.</p>
<p>This venerable pile has now undergone a &#8747;econd ruin.  The old oaks and elms, the ancient natives of the &#8747;cene, are felled.  Weeds and &#8747;piry gra&#8747;s have taken po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion of the courts, and obliterated the every plan of a garden: while the hou&#8747;e it&#8747;elf, (who&#8747;e ho&#8747;pitable roof de&#8747;erved a better fate,) is now a &#8747;cene of de&#8747;olation.  Two wretched families, the only inhabitants of the place, occupy the two ends of the vaulted hall; the fragment of a tattered curtain, reaching half <unclear>way</unclear> to
<pb n="125"/>
the top, being the &#8747;imple boundary of their re&#8747;pective limits.  All the re&#8747;t is wa&#8747;te: no other part of the hou&#8747;e is habitable.  The chambers unwindowed, and almo&#8747;t unroofed, fluttering with rags of ancient tape&#8747;try, are the haunts of daws, and pigeons; which bur&#8747;t out in the clouds of du&#8747;t, when the doors are opened: while the floors, yielding to the tread, make curio&#8747;ity dangerous.  A few pictures, heir-looms of the wall, which have long de&#8747;erved oblivion, by I know not what fate, are the only appendage of this di&#8747;&#8747;olving pile, which have triumphed over the injuries of time.</p>
<p>Shake&#8747;pear's ca&#8747;tle of Macbeth could not be more the haunt of &#8747;wallows and martins, than this.  You &#8747;een them every where about the ruins; either twittering on broken coins'; threading &#8747;ome fracture arch; or pur&#8747;uing each other, in &#8747;creaming circles, round the walls of the ca&#8747;tle<ptr target="n28"/>.</p>

<p>OUR la&#8747;t expedition, in the neighbourhood of Carli&#8747;le, was to &#8747;ee the improvements of Mr. Graham of Netherby; and the &#8747;cene of de&#8747;olation, occa&#8747;ioned by the late overflowing of Solway-mo&#8747;s.</p>
<p>Mr. Graham's improvements are not confined to a garden, or the &#8747;pace of a mile or two around his hou&#8747;e.  The whole country is changed; and from a barren wa&#8747;te, hath a&#8747;&#8747;umed the face -- if not of beauty, at lea&#8747;t of fertility.</p>
<p>The domain of Netherby lies on the very &#8747;kirts of the Engli&#8747;h border.  The Romans con&#8747;idered it as a part of Caledonia; and &#8747;hut it from the Briti&#8747;h pale.  In after ages the di&#8747;trict around it a&#8747;&#8747;umed the name of the
<pb n="128"/>
<i>Debateable-land</i>, and was the great rendezvous of tho&#8747;e crews of outlawed banditti, who, under the denomination of <i>Mo&#8747;s-troopers</i>, plundered the country.  We have already had occa&#8747;ion to mention them.  In this neighbourhood were the &#8747;trong holds of many of their chiefs; particularly of Johnny Arm&#8747;trong of famous memory; the moted ruins of who&#8747;e ca&#8747;tle are &#8747;till extant.</p>
<p>Among the&#8747;e people the arts of tillage were unknown.  It was ab&#8747;urd to be at the trouble of &#8747;owing land them&#8747;elves, when they could &#8747;o ea&#8747;ily plunder the lands of others.</p>
<p>Tho the union of the two kingdoms put an end to the&#8747;e ravages on the borders; yet the manners of the inhabitants, in &#8747;ome re&#8747;pects, &#8747;uffered little change.  Their native lazine&#8747;s, and inattention to all the arts of hu&#8747;bandry, remained.  They occupied large tracts of excellent land at ea&#8747;y rates: but having no idea of producing yearly crops from the &#8747;ame &#8747;oil by culture; they ploughed their patches of ground alternately, leaving them to recover their fertility by fallows.  An indolent and &#8747;canty maintenance was all they wi&#8747;hed; and this they obtained from a &#8747;mall portion of their land, with a &#8747;mall portion of their labour.  Their
<pb n="129"/>
lords in the mean time, never lived on the &#8747;pot; and knew little of the &#8747;tate either of the country, or of it's inhabitants.</p>
<p>Mr. Graham immediately &#8747;et him&#8747;elf to alter this &#8747;tate of things.  He built a noble man&#8747;ion for him&#8747;elf; which makes a grand appearance, ri&#8747;ing on the ruins of a Roman &#8747;tation.  Without the pre&#8747;ence of the lord, he knew it was in vain to expect reformation.  He divided his lands into moderate farms; and built commodious farm-hou&#8747;es.  As his lands improved, he rai&#8747;ed his rents: and his tenants in proportion found it nece&#8747;&#8747;ary to increa&#8747;e their labour.  Thus he has double his own income, and introduced a &#8747;pirit of indu&#8747;try into the country.  The&#8747;e indolent inhabitants of the borders begin now to work like other labourers; and notwith&#8747;tanding they pay higher rents, live more comfortably: for idlene&#8747;s can never be attended with the comforts of indu&#8747;try.</p>
<p>To bring about this great change, Mr. Graham thinks it nece&#8747;&#8747;ary to rule his &#8747;ubjects with a rod of iron.  While he makes them labourers, he keeps them &#8747;laves.  -- Perhaps indeed the rough manners of the people in

tho&#8747;e parts, could not ea&#8747;ily be moulded by the hand of tenderne&#8747;s.</p>
<p>The feudal idea of va&#8747;&#8747;alage, which has long di&#8747;appeared in all the internal parts of England, remains here in great force; and throws a large &#8747;hare of power into the hands of the landholder.  Mr. Graham's e&#8747;tates, which are very exten&#8747;ive, contain about &#8747;ix hundred tenants; all of whom, with their families, lie in a manner at his mercy for their &#8747;ub&#8747;i&#8747;tence.  Their time and labour he commands, by their mode of tenure, whenever he plea&#8747;es.  Under the denomination of <i>boon-days</i>, he expects, at any time, their per&#8747;onal &#8747;ervice; and can, in a few hours, mu&#8747;ter the &#8747;trength of five or &#8747;ix hundred men and hor&#8747;es.</p>
<p>Once he had occa&#8747;ion to call them together on military &#8747;ervice.  On a &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed injury,<ptr target="n29"/> which, about two years ago, he had done the

<pb n="131"/>
Scotch-borders, by intercepting the &#8747;almon in the E&#8747;k, a body of three hundred of the&#8747;e people marched down upon him with an intention to de&#8747;troy his works.  He had intelligence of their de&#8747;ign, and i&#8747;&#8747;uing his precepts, mu&#8747;tered, in a few hours, above four hundred men before his gates, armed as the exigence would allow: and if the Scotch, on finding &#8747;uch &#8747;uperiority, had not retreated, Mr. Graham, who told us the &#8747;tory him&#8747;elf, &#8747;aid he believed, that all the &#8747;pirit and animo&#8747;ity of ancient times would have revived on this occa&#8747;ion.</p>
<note id="n29">I have heard &#8747;ince, that this injury has been proved to be a real one; and that reparation hath been made.</note>
<p>In a civil light he acts on as large a &#8747;cale.  His manor-courts are kept with great &#8747;trictne&#8747;s; in which his attorney, with a jury, &#8747;its regularly to try cau&#8747;es; and the tenants are injoined, at the hazard of being turned out of their farms, to bring into the&#8747;e courts every &#8747;uit under the value of five pounds.  Thus he prevents much ill-blood among them, by bringing their di&#8747;putes to a &#8747;peedy i&#8747;&#8747;ue; and giving the quarrel no time to rankle.  He &#8747;aves them al&#8747;o much expence: for a &#8747;uit, which in the
<pb n="132"/>
king's courts would at lea&#8747;t co&#8747;t five or &#8747;ix pounds; may in his, be carried through all it's forms for eight-pence. -- At Patterdale we found a nominal king.  Here we found almo&#8747;t a king in reality.</p>
<p>The works on the E&#8747;k, which gave &#8747;o much offence to the Scotch-borderers, de&#8747;erve more notice.  They con&#8747;i&#8747;ted of a ma&#8747;&#8747;y head thrown acro&#8747;s the river, con&#8747;tructed at a great expence, hewn &#8747;tone.  This mole was formed at right angles with the bank; but the floods of the en&#8747;uing winter &#8747;wept it away.  It was attempted a &#8747;econd time on the &#8747;ame plan; but was a &#8747;econd time de&#8747;troyed.  Mr. Brindley was then &#8747;ent for, who&#8747;e works near Manche&#8747;ter had given him &#8747;o high a reputation.  He changed the plan; and in&#8747;tead of carrying the mole in a direct line acro&#8747;s the river, formed it in a curve, arching again&#8747;t the &#8747;tream: &#8747;o that it re&#8747;i&#8747;ts the current, as a bridge does the incumbent weight.  This work has &#8747;tood &#8747;everal very great floods, and &#8747;eems &#8747;ufficiently

<note id="n30">Since this was written, I am informed, Mr. Brindley's work was de&#8747;troyed from an un&#8747;u&#8747;pected quarter, when the water was low.  On the breaking of a fro&#8747;t, a great quantity of ice coming down the river, and collecting at this &#8747;toppage, &#8747;ome of it edged under the loo&#8747;er parts of the foundation, and being pre&#8747;&#8747;ed on with a continued acce&#8747;&#8747;ion of &#8747;trength, the whole blew up.</note>
<p>The chief end which this work had in view, was a fi&#8747;hery.  At this place &#8747;almon-coops are placed; where all the fi&#8747;h, which enter the E&#8747;k, are taken.  But be&#8747;ides this, and other purpo&#8747;es of utility, it adds great beauty to the neighbourood.  The E&#8747;k, which was before in compari&#8747;on, a &#8747;hallow &#8747;tream, gliding un&#8747;een beneath it's banks, is now a noble piece of water, rai&#8747;ed to a level with them, and &#8747;een to great advantage from the hou&#8747;e, and every part of the ground.</p>
<p>It was in this part of the country where that dreadful inundation, from the over-flowing of

Solway-mo&#8747;s, de&#8747;troyed lately &#8747;o large a di&#8747;trict.  T &#8747;ee the effects of this, was the object of our next expedition.</p>
<p>Solway-mo&#8747;s is a flat area, about &#8747;even miles in circumference.  The <i>&#8747;ub&#8747;tance</i> of it is a gro&#8747;s fluid, compo&#8747;ed of mud, and the putrid fibres of heath, diluted by internal &#8747;prings, which ari&#8747;e in every part.  The <i>&#8747;urface</i> is a dray cru&#8747;t, covered with mo&#8747;s, and ru&#8747;hes; offering a fair appearance over an unfound bottom -- &#8747;haking under the lea&#8747;t pre&#8747;&#8747;ure.  Cattle by in&#8747;tinct know, and avoid it.  Where ru&#8747;hes grow, the bottom is &#8747;ounde&#8747;t.  The adventrous pa&#8747;&#8747;enger therefore, who &#8747;ometimes, in dry &#8747;ea&#8747;ons, traver&#8747;es this perilous wa&#8747;te to &#8747;ave a few miles, picks his cautious way over the ru&#8747;hy tuffocks, as they appear before him.  If his foot &#8747;lip, or if he venture to de&#8747;ert this mark of &#8747;ecurity, it is po&#8747;&#8747;ible he may never more be heard of.</p>
<p>At the battle of Solway, in the time of Henry VIII, Oliver Sinclair was imprudently &#8747;et over the Scotch army, which had no confidence in him.  A total rout en&#8747;ued; when an unfortunate troop of hor&#8747;e, driven by their fears, plunged into this mora&#8747;s, which in&#8747;tantly clo&#8747;ed upon them.  The tale, which
<pb n="135"/>
was traditional; was generally believed; but is now authenticated.  A man and hor&#8747;e in compleat armour were lately found by the peat-diggers, in the place, where it was always &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed the affair had happened; and are pre&#8747;erved at the hou&#8747;e of a Scotch baronet, if I mi&#8747;take not, of the name of Maxwell; as we were informed by a gentleman<ptr target="n31"/> of the borders, who a&#8747;&#8747;ured us he had &#8747;een them him&#8747;elf.  The &#8747;keleton of each was well pre&#8747;erved; and the different parts of the armour ea&#8747;ily di&#8747;tingui&#8747;hed.</p>

<p>Solway-mo&#8747;s is bounded on the &#8747;outh by a cultivated plain, which declines gently, through the &#8747;pace of a mile, to the river E&#8747;k.  This plain is rather lower than the mo&#8747;s it&#8747;elf, being &#8747;eparated from it by a brea&#8747;twork formed by digging peat, which makes an irregular, tho perpendicular, line of low, black boundary.</p>
<p>It was the bur&#8747;ting of the mo&#8747;s through this peat brea&#8747;twork, over the plain between it and the E&#8747;k, which occa&#8747;ioned that dreadful ruin, the effects of which we came hither to explore. -- The more remarkable circum&#8747;tances, re-
<pb n="136"/>
lating to this calamitous event, as we had them on the be&#8747;t authority, were the&#8747;e.</p>
<p>On the 16th of November, 1771, in a dark tempe&#8747;tuous night, the inhabitants of the plain were alarmed with a dreadful cra&#8747;h, which they could in no way account for.  Many of them were then abroad in the fields, watching their cattle; le&#8747;t the E&#8747;k, which was ri&#8747;ing violently in the &#8747;torm, &#8747;hould carry them off.  None of tho&#8747;e mi&#8747;erable people could conceive the noi&#8747;e they heard to proceed from any cau&#8747;e, but the overflowing of the river in &#8747;ome &#8747;hape, tho to them unaccountable.  Such indeed, as liver nearer the &#8747;ource of the eruption, were &#8747;en&#8747;ible, that the noi&#8747;e came in different direction; but were equally at a lo&#8747;s for the cau&#8747;e.</p>
<p>In the mean time the enormous ma&#8747;s of fluid &#8747;ub&#8747;tance, which had bur&#8747;t from the mo&#8747;s, moved &#8747;lowly on, &#8747;preading it&#8747;elf more and more, as it got po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion of the plain.  Some of the inhabitants, though the terror of the night, could plainly di&#8747;cover it advancing, like a moving hill.  This was in fact the ca&#8747;e; for the gu&#8747;h of mud carried before it,
<pb n="137"/>
through the fir&#8747;t two or three hundred yards of it's cour&#8747;e, a part of the brea&#8747;twork; which, tho low, was yet &#8747;everal feet in perpendicular height.  But it &#8747;oon depo&#8747;ited this &#8747;olid ma&#8747;s; and became a heavy fluid.  One hou&#8747;e after another, it &#8747;pread round -- filled -- and cru&#8747;hed into ruin; ju&#8747;t giving time to the terrified inhabitants to e&#8747;cape.  Scarce any thing was &#8747;aved; except their lives: nothing of their furniture: few of their cattle.  Some people were even &#8747;urprized in their beds, and had the additional di&#8747;tre&#8747;s of flying naked from the ruin.</p>
<p>The morning-light explained the cau&#8747;e of this amazing &#8747;cene of terror; and &#8747;hewed the calamity in it's full extent: and yet, among all the conjectures of that dreadful night, the mi&#8747;chief which really happened, had never been &#8747;uppo&#8747;ed.  Who could have imagined, that a brea&#8747;twork, which had &#8747;tood for ages, &#8747;hould at length give way? or that tho&#8747;e &#8747;ubterraneous floods, which had been bedded in darkne&#8747;s, &#8747;ince the memory of man, &#8747;hould ever bur&#8747;t from their black abode?</p>
<pb n="138"/>
<p>This dreadful inundation, tho the fir&#8747;t &#8747;hock of it was the mo&#8747;t tremendous, continued &#8747;till &#8747;preading for many weeks, till it covered the whole plain -- an area of five hundred acres; and, like molten metal poured into a mould, filled all the hollows of it, lying in &#8747;ome parts thirty of forty feet deep, reducing the whole to one level &#8747;urface.  The overplus found it's way into the E&#8747;k; where it's quantity was &#8747;uch, as to annoy the fi&#8747;h; no &#8747;almon, during that &#8747;ea&#8747;on, venturing into the river.  We were a&#8747;&#8747;ured al&#8747;o, that many lumps of earth, which had floated out at &#8747;ea, were taken up, &#8747;ome months after, at the i&#8747;le of Man.</p>
<p>As we de&#8747;cended from the higher grounds to take a nearer view of this &#8747;cene of horror, it exhibited a very grand appearance.  The whole plain was covered by a thick &#8747;moke, occa&#8747;ioned by a &#8747;mothering fire &#8747;et to it in various parts, with a view to con&#8747;ume it; and brought before us that &#8747;imple, and &#8747;ublime idea of <i>the &#8747;moke of a country going up like the &#8747;moke of a furnace.</i></p>
<pb n="139"/>
<p>When we came to plain on that &#8747;ide, which is next the E&#8747;k, it had &#8747;o forbidding an a&#8747;pect, as far as we could di&#8747;cover through the &#8747;moke, that we almo&#8747;t de&#8747;paired of cro&#8747;&#8747;ing to the cha&#8747;m, as we had intended.  On hor&#8747;e-back it was impo&#8747;&#8747;ible; and when we had alighted, we &#8747;tood he&#8747;itating on the brink, whether it were prudent, even on foot, to attempt &#8747;o dangerous a march.</p>
<p>While we remained in this &#8747;ituation, we ob&#8747;erved &#8747;everal groups of pea&#8747;ants working in the ruins: and beckoning to the neare&#8747;t, one of the group came forward.  He was an elderly man, &#8747;trengthening his &#8747;teps with a long mea&#8747;uring wand.  His feature, and gait, tho hard and clowni&#8747;h, were marked with an air of vulgar con&#8747;equence.  As he approached, one of our company, who knew him, acco&#8747;ted him by the name of Wil&#8747;on; and we found he was the per&#8747;on who conducted the works which were &#8747;et on foot to clear the &#8747;oil of this melancholy incumbrance.</p>
<p>On informing him of our difficulties, and a&#8747;king, where we might venture acro&#8747;s the plain; he bad us, like C&#230;&#8747;ar, with an air of a&#8747;&#8747;urance, follow him, and fear nothing.  From one tu&#8747;&#8747;ock to another, we followed,
<pb n="140"/>
&#8747;ometimes &#8747;tepping -- &#8747;ometimes leaping -- and &#8747;ometimes he&#8747;itating, whether to go on, or to return.  In very difficult places, our guide conde&#8747;cended to lay us a plank.  In the mid&#8747;t of our perplexity, one of our company, &#8747;traying a &#8747;tep from the right path, fell in; but the mud being &#8747;hallow in that part, he &#8747;ank only to the knees.  Mr. Wil&#8747;on helped him out; but reprimanded his carele&#8747;&#8747;ne&#8747;s.  The reproof and the example having a good effect upon us all, we followed our guide, like pack-hor&#8747;es in a &#8747;tring, and at length compleated our undertaking.</p>
<p>When we got to the gulph, from whence all this mi&#8747;chief had i&#8747;&#8747;ued, the &#8747;pectacle was hideous.  The &#8747;urface of <i>the mo&#8747;s it&#8747;elf</i> had &#8747;uffered little change.  Near the cha&#8747;m it appeared indented, through a &#8747;pace of &#8747;everal yards: but not in any degree, as one would have expected from &#8747;o ca&#8747;t a di&#8747;charge.  The mouth of the cha&#8747;m was heaped round by mon&#8747;trous piles of ruin, formed by the broken brea&#8747;twork, and the &#8747;hell of the mo&#8747;s, on the fir&#8747;t great bur&#8747;t; and a black, mo&#8747;&#8747;y tincture continued &#8747;till to i&#8747;&#8747;ue from it.  If this continue to run, as it probably will, it may be a fortunate circum&#8747;tance; and &#8747;ave the country
<pb n="141"/>
from any farther mi&#8747;chief, by draining this bloated ma&#8747;s through a perpetual di&#8747;charge.</p>
<p>As we &#8747;tood on the higher ground, and got to windward of the &#8747;moke, we obtained a clear idea of the plain, and of the cour&#8747;e of the irruption over it.  Many fragments of a very large &#8747;ize, which had been carried away in the fir&#8747;t full &#8747;tream of the di&#8747;charge, appeared thrown to a con&#8747;iderable di&#8747;tance.  The&#8747;e were what made that moving bulwark, which &#8747;ome of the inhabitants had &#8747;een in the night.  Fragments of a &#8747;maller &#8747;ize, (and yet many of the&#8747;e con&#8747;iderable) appeared &#8747;cattered over the plain, as the heavy torrent was able to carry them.  The inter&#8747;tices between the fragments, which had been filled with fluid mo&#8747;s, were now baked by the heat of the &#8747;un, and cru&#8747;ted over like the great &#8747;urface of the mo&#8747;s it&#8747;elf.  Here and there, along this &#8747;urface, the broken rafters of a hou&#8747;e, or the top of a bla&#8747;ted tree were &#8747;een; and made an odd appearance, ri&#8747;ing as it were, out of the ground.  But through the whole wa&#8747;te, there was not the lea&#8747;t &#8747;ign left of any culture; tho this plain had once been the pride of the country.  Lands, which
<pb n="142"/>
in the evening would have let for twenty &#8747;hillings an acre, by the morning-light were not worth &#8747;ix-pence.</p>
<p>On this well cultivated plain twenty-eight families had their dwellings, and little farms; every one of which, except perhaps a few, who lived near the &#8747;kirts of it, had the world totally to begin again. -- Mr. Graham, agreeably to the prudential maxims he has ever ob&#8747;erved, affords them little a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;tance him&#8747;elf; and di&#8747;courages the bounty of others. -- He &#8747;eems to wi&#8747;h his dominions &#8747;hould thrive by indu&#8747;try alone; and would have his &#8747;ubjects depends on this great virtue for the &#8747;upply of every want, and the reparation of every lo&#8747;s.  If the maxim, in &#8747;o full an extent, be good; it requires at lea&#8747;t, a great hardine&#8747;s of re&#8747;olution to carry it into practice.</p>
<p>Whether the immen&#8747;e work of clearing this plain can ever totally be effected, is a doubt with many.  It is attempted however with great &#8747;pirit, through the united force of the two powerful elements of fire and water.</p>
<pb n="143"/>
<p>All the &#8747;kirts, and other parts of it which are drier than the re&#8747;t, are reduced by fire; which occa&#8747;ioned the great &#8747;moke from the plain, as we have de&#8747;cended into it; and which, at that di&#8747;tance, appeared to ari&#8747;e from the whole.</p>
<p>But this method is not found very effectual; as it reaches only a little below the &#8747;urface.  Much more is expected from the application of water; which is the part our guide Mr. Wil&#8747;on has undertaken. -- How well qualified he is for the undertaking, and in what manner he propo&#8747;es to accompli&#8747;h it, may be conceived from the following &#8747;tory.</p>
<p>Mr. Graham's hou&#8747;e &#8747;tands on an eminence, with higher grounds above it.  A little on one &#8747;ide of the front, &#8747;tood a knoll, which made a di&#8747;agreeable appearance before his windows. -- Being de&#8747;irous therefore of removing it, he &#8747;ent to Newca&#8747;tle for a per&#8747;on accu&#8747;tomed to works of this kind.  The undertaker came, &#8747;urveyed the ground, and e&#8747;timated the expence at thirteen hundred pounds.</p>
<p>While the affair was in agitation, Mr. Graham heard, that Wil&#8747;on had &#8747;aid, the earth
<pb n="144"/>
might be removed at a much ea&#8747;ier rate.  He was examined on the &#8747;ubject; and his an&#8747;wers appeared &#8747;o rational, that he was &#8747;et to work.  He had already &#8747;urveyed the higher grounds, where he fir&#8747;t collected all the &#8747;prings he found, into two large re&#8747;ervoirs; from which he cut a precipitate channel, points at an abrupt corner of the knoll.  He cut al&#8747;o a channel of communication between his two re&#8747;ervoirs.  The&#8747;e being both filled, he opened his &#8747;luices, and let out &#8747;uch a continued torrent of water, (the upper pool feeding the lower) that he very &#8747;oon carried away the corner of the knoll, again&#8747;t which he had pointed his artillery.  He then charged again, and levelled again&#8747;t another part with equal &#8747;ucce&#8747;s.  In &#8747;hort, by a few efforts of this kind, he carried away the whole hill; and told Mr. Graham, with an air of triumph, that, if he plea&#8747;ed, he would carry away his hou&#8747;e next.  The work was compleated in a few days; and Mr. Graham him&#8747;elf informed us, that the whole expence did not amount to twenty pounds.</p>
<p>This man, with &#8747;o much genius about him, lives in the lowe&#8747;t &#8747;tile of life; and works for the lowe&#8747;t wages.  When we regretted, that he was paid &#8747;o inadequately to his worth, we

were a&#8747;&#8747;ured, as his appearance indeed te&#8747;tified, that he had no higher idea of happine&#8747;s, than to get drunk after his day's labour: and that better wages would only de&#8747;troy him &#8747;ooner.</p>
<p>I have &#8747;ince heard, that one hundred and fifty acres of the plain are now cleared by the ingenuity of this man; and that there is rea&#8747;on to believe, he will in time clear a con&#8747;iderable part of it.  From the re&#8747;ervoirs formed by a little &#8747;tream at the highe&#8747;t part of the over-flowed ground, he cut channels in various directions to the E&#8747;k: and when the water was let off, he placed numbers of men by the &#8747;ide of the &#8747;tream, who rolled into it large ma&#8747;&#8747;es of mo&#8747;&#8747;y earth, which were hardened by the &#8747;un.</p>

<p>HAVING &#8747;een &#8747;uch parts of the country on the borders of England, as were mo&#8747;t curious; we &#8747;et out on our return.  But, in&#8747;tead of taking the Ke&#8747;wick-road, we propo&#8747;ed to vary our rout, by the mountains of Brugh.<ptr target="n32"/>.</p>
<note id="n32">See page 168, Vol. I.</note>
<p>At Penrith the road divides.  We turned to the left, towards Appelby; and &#8747;oon fell into a rich, and beautiful vale, in which the river Lowther, gliding under lofty woody banks, bore us company a con&#8747;iderable way.</p>
<p>When we cro&#8747;&#8747;ed that river, the &#8747;ituation of Brougham-ca&#8747;tle, one of the &#8747;eat of the
<pb n="148"/>
celebrated counte&#8747;s of Pembroke, attracted our notice.  It had not e&#8747;caped the notice of the Romans; who fixed here a &#8747;tation to command the country.  It appears as great, at the time, in a picture&#8747;que light, as it did formerly in a military one.  But we had not time to ride up to it; contenting our&#8747;elves with viewing it only as the ornament of a &#8747;econd di&#8747;tance.</p>
<p>At Clifton the road opens again into a wild &#8747;cene.  Here we examined the &#8747;pot, where, in the year 1745, the rebels entering an inclo&#8747;ed country, made a &#8747;tand; and lined the hedges to retard the duke of Cumberland's pur&#8747;uit.  Sir Jo&#8747;eph York, in his road from Ireland, had been there, we found, a few days before.  He had accompanied the duke in his expedition again&#8747;t the rebels; and &#8747;topped a little at Clifton to review the &#8747;cene.  He left the people, we were informed, much plea&#8747;ed with his remembering a gallant action, which had been achieved, about that time, by a heroine of the country, who had carried a letter acro&#8747;s the fire of the rebels, when no other me&#8747;&#8747;enger could be obtained.</p>
<pb n="149"/>
<p>From Clifton, we turned a little a&#8747;ide to &#8747;ee Lowther-hall, the &#8747;eat of lord Lond&#8747;dale.  It is only a temporary hou&#8747;e, the old man&#8747;ion having been burnt in the time of the late lord.  But materials are now collecting for a grand &#8747;tructure.  It is &#8747;ituated in an exten&#8747;ive park, which contains a great variety of beautiful &#8747;cenery.</p>
<p>From Lowther-hall, we pur&#8747;ued our rout to Appelby, keeping on our left that va&#8747;t tract of barren country, called Wingfield-fore&#8747;t.</p>
<p>The &#8747;ituation of Appelby-ca&#8747;tle, which belongs to the earl of Thanet, is magnificent.  It &#8747;tands on a rocky eminence, falling precipitately into the river Eden; which half incircles it.  The banks of the river, and the &#8747;ides of the precipice, are finely hung with wood.  The ca&#8747;tle is &#8747;till in good repair; and is a noble pile.  But, in a picture&#8747;que light, it lo&#8747;es half it's beauty, from it's being broken into two parts.  A <i>&#8747;maller</i> break from a grand pile removes heavine&#8747;s; and is a &#8747;ource

of beauty.  We have &#8747;een the principle exemplified in mountains, and other objects<ptr target="n33"/>.  But here the whole is divided into two parts, of &#8747;uch <i>equal</i> dimen&#8747;ions, that each a&#8747;pires to pre-eminence.  Each therefore becomes a &#8747;eparate whole: and both together di&#8747;tract the eye.  The detached part &#8747;hould always ob&#8747;erve a due inferiority.</p>
<note id="n33">See page 55, Vol. II.</note>
<p>We had not time to take a view <i>from</i> the ca&#8747;tle; which mu&#8747;t command a very beautiful di&#8747;tance, over the woody vale of Eden, and the mountains, which ari&#8747;e beyond it.</p>
<p>Appelby-ca&#8747;tle was the Apallaba of the Romans; and pre&#8747;erves it's origin clearer in it's etymology, than the generality of Roman &#8747;tations.</p>
<p>This ca&#8747;tle was formerly the favourite man&#8747;ion of Ann, counte&#8747;s of Pembroke, Dor&#8747;et, and Montgomery.  As this very extraordinary lady is &#8747;till the object of great veneration in the&#8747;e parts; as her hi&#8747;tory is curious, and le&#8747;s known than it ought to be; and as it is &#8747;o

intimately connected with all this country; the reader will excu&#8747;e the following digre&#8747;&#8747;ion.</p>
<p>She was the daughter of George Clifford, earl of Cumberland; one of the heroes of the gallant age of Elizabeth.  This noble per&#8747;on di&#8747;tingui&#8747;hed him&#8747;elf chiefly by his naval expeditions; on which he was &#8747;uffered, in tho&#8747;e frugal times, to expend a great portion of his patrimony.  In return for his patrioti&#8747;m, he was appointed by his royal mi&#8747;tre&#8747;s, her champion in all tilts and tournaments; where the grace, and dignity of his behaviour, and his &#8747;kill and addre&#8747;s in arms, were equally admired.  The rich armour he wore, on the&#8747;e occa&#8747;ions, is &#8747;till &#8747;hewn in this ca&#8747;tle.</p>
<p>Lady Ann Cilfford was only ten years of age, when her father died.  But her education was conducted by two excellent women -- her mother, a daughter of the earl of Bedford -- and afterwards by her aunt the counte&#8747;s of Warwick.</p>
<p>In her early youth &#8747;he married lord Buckhur&#8747;t, earl of Dor&#8747;et; with whom during a few years &#8747;he lived very happily.  But he &#8747;oon leaving her a widow; &#8747;he married, &#8747;ix years after, Philip earl of Pembroke, and Montgomery.</p>
<pb n="152"/>
<p>This nobleman, through the favour of James I, as a reward for his great &#8747;kill in the arts of hunting, and hawking, po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ed a prodigious e&#8747;tate; not le&#8747;s, at that time, than eighteen thou&#8747;and pounds a year.  His manner of living was &#8747;umptuous beyond example; and his apparatus for field-&#8747;ports magnificent beyond belief.  His dog-kennels were &#8747;uperb; and his &#8747;tables vied with palaces.  But his falconry was his chief pride; which he had furni&#8747;hed, at a wonderful expence, with birds of game; and proper per&#8747;ons to manage, train, and exerci&#8747;e them.</p>
<p>Here ends the hi&#8747;tory of Philip early of Pembroke -- unle&#8747;s we add, that in private life, he was vicious, ignorant, and unlettered in a &#8747;urprizing degree; and that his public character was &#8747;tained with ingratitude, and tergiver&#8747;ation, by the noble hi&#8747;torian of tho&#8747;e unfortunate times.</p>
<p>With this worthle&#8747;s man his unhappy lady lived near twenty years.  During the latter part of his life indeed he became &#8747;o di&#8747;&#8747;olute, that &#8747;he was obliged to leave him.</p>
<pb n="153"/>
<p>About the time of his death &#8747;he found her&#8747;elf po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ed of a very ample fortune.  For, it &#8747;eems, her immediate &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ion to the large e&#8747;tates of her ance&#8747;tors in the north, had been di&#8747;puted by an uncle, who inherited the title: and an award had been given again&#8747;t her by James I, to which indeed &#8747;he would never &#8747;ubmit.  The uncle, and his &#8747;on however both dying, the great e&#8747;tates of the Cliffords, tho con&#8747;iderably impaired by her father's genero&#8747;ity, came to her without any farther mole&#8747;tation.  She had be&#8747;ides two great jointures.  That which &#8747;he received from her fir&#8747;t hu&#8747;band, was between three, and four thou&#8747;and, a year; and that from the early of Pembroke was nearly equal to it.</p>
<p>On the event of the earl of Pembroke's death, &#8747;he immediately laid out the whole plan of her future life; determining to retire into the north; and &#8747;pend it on her own e&#8747;tate.</p>
<pb n="154"/>
<p>In ancient times the earls of Cumberland po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ed five noble ca&#8747;tles in the three counties of York&#8747;hire, We&#8747;tmoreland, and Cumberland. -- Skipton -- Pendragon -- Appelby -- Brougham -- and Brugh.  The tower of Bardon al&#8747;o was another fortified &#8747;eat, where they &#8747;ometimes re&#8747;ided.  But all the&#8747;e ca&#8747;tles had &#8747;uffered in the late civil wars; and were reduced, more or le&#8747;s, to a &#8747;tate of great decay.</p>
<p>The counte&#8747;s of Pembroke however determined, on her coming into the north, to repair and furni&#8747;h them all.  This great work &#8747;he compleated during the years 1657, and 1658; and placed over the gate of each ca&#8747;tle the following in&#8747;cription:</p>
<p>THIS CASTLE WAS REPAIRED BY THE LADY AN CLIFFORD, COUNTESS DOWAGER OF PEMBROKE, &amp;c. IN THE YEAR  --  AFTER THE MAIN PART OF IT HAD LAIN RUINOUS EVER SINCE 1648, WHEN IT WAS DEMOLISHED, ALMOST TO THE GROUND BY THE PARLIAMENT THEN SITTING AT WESTMINSTER, BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN A GARRISON IN THE CIVIL WARS.  IS. LVIII. 12. LAUS DEO!</p>
<pb n="155"/>
<p>Oliver Cromwell was, at this time, at the head of affairs; who&#8747;e hypocri&#8747;y and villany the counte&#8747;s of Pembroke dete&#8747;ted: and as &#8747;he had too much &#8747;pirit to conceal her &#8747;entiments, it is probable, the protector was enough informed, how little &#8747;he e&#8747;teemed him.  Her friends therefore, knowing the jealou&#8747;y of his temper, advi&#8747;ed her not to be &#8747;o profu&#8747;e in building; as they were well a&#8747;&#8747;ured that as &#8747;oon as &#8747;he had built her ca&#8747;tles, he would order them to be de&#8747;troyed.  But &#8747;he an&#8747;wered with great &#8747;pirit, "Let him de&#8747;troy them if he will: but he &#8747;hall &#8747;urely find, that as often as he de&#8747;troys them, I will rebuild them, while he leaves me a &#8747;hilling in my pocket."</p>
<p>She &#8747;hewed her contempt for Cromwell, and her own high &#8747;pirit, on another occa&#8747;ion.  Her uncle had left her affairs &#8747;o involved, that &#8747;he found her&#8747;elf under a nece&#8747;&#8747;ity of recovering &#8747;ome of her rights by a tedious law&#8747;uit.  The affair being repre&#8747;ented to Cromwell by the oppo&#8747;ite party, he offered his mediation.  But &#8747;he an&#8747;wered loftily, &#8747;he would never accept it, while there was any
<pb n="156"/>
law to be found in England.  "What! &#8747;aid &#8747;he, does he imagine, that I, who refu&#8747;ed to &#8747;ubmit to king James, will &#8747;ubmit to him?"</p>
<p>But, notwith&#8747;tanding her &#8747;pirit, neither her ca&#8747;tles, nor her e&#8747;tates were injured.  Some a&#8747;cribed this lenity to Cromwell's reverence of her virtue; which is very improbable: others, to her numerous friends, with whom the protector wi&#8747;hed to keep fair; which, it is mo&#8747;t likely, was the truth.</p>
<p>Her di&#8747;like to Cromwell was not founded on party; but on principle.  She had the &#8747;ame di&#8747;like to Charles, when &#8747;he became acquainted with the &#8747;pirit of his government.  On being pre&#8747;&#8747;ed by her friends, &#8747;ometimes after the re&#8747;toration, to go to court; "By no means, &#8747;aid &#8747;he; unle&#8747;s I may be allowed to wear blinkers<ptr target="n34"/>."</p>
<note id="n34">Blinkers are tho&#8747;e blinds affixed to the bridles of coach-hor&#8747;es, which prevent their &#8747;eeing what they ought not to &#8747;ee.</note>
<p>Be&#8747;ides her ca&#8747;tles, &#8747;he found likewi&#8747;e in ruins, almo&#8747;t all the churches, belonging
<pb n="157"/>
to the &#8747;everal villages on her e&#8747;tates.  The &#8747;pire of one had been beaten down: another had been turned into a magazine: a third into a ho&#8747;pital.  Seven of them were in this ruinous condition: each of which &#8747;he either built from the ground, or repaired; furni&#8747;hing them all with decent pews; that her tenants, in every part of her e&#8747;tates, might have churches in their neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Her &#8747;everal buildings, and repairs, at her fir&#8747;t coming into the north, did not co&#8747;t her le&#8747;s, than forty thou&#8747;and pounds.</p>
<p>At each of her ca&#8747;tles &#8747;he re&#8747;ided a part of every year; regularly moving from one to the other; thus over-looking the whole of her va&#8747;t e&#8747;tates; and ble&#8747;&#8747;ing the country, wherever &#8747;he went.  For &#8747;he was every where the common patrone&#8747;s of all, who were di&#8747;tre&#8747;&#8747;ed.  Her heart was as large, as her ability: and mi&#8747;ery of every kind, that could get it's &#8747;tory fairly repre&#8747;ented to her, was &#8747;ure of relief.</p>
<pb n="158"/>
<p>Nor was &#8747;he content with <i>occa&#8747;ional</i> acts of charity; but made many of her charitable intentions <i>permanent</i> by endowments.  The greate&#8747;t of the&#8747;e works were two ho&#8747;pitals, which &#8747;he founded.</p>
<p>One little plea&#8747;ing monument of this kind &#8747;tands by the &#8747;ide of the road, between Penrith and Appelby.  It is a monument indeed rather of her filial piety, than of her charity.  On this &#8747;pot, in her early youth, &#8747;he had parted with her beloved mother; whom &#8747;he never afterwards &#8747;aw.  She always remembered this parting-&#8747;cene with the tendere&#8747;t feelings: and, when &#8747;he came into We&#8747;tmoreland, among her other buildings, &#8747;he rai&#8747;ed a pillar to record it; with a &#8747;tone-table at it's ba&#8747;e.  The pillar, which is &#8747;till known in the country by the name of <i>Counte&#8747;s-pillar</i>, is decorated with her arms; a &#8747;undial, for the benefit or travellers; and the following in&#8747;cription.</p>
<pb n="159"/>
<p>THIS PILLAR WAS ERECTED IN THE YEAR 1656, BY ANN COUNTESS DOWAGER OF PEMBROKE, &amp;c. FOR A MEMORIAL OF HER LAST PARTING, IN THIS PLACE, WITH HER GOOD AND PIOUS MOTHER, MARGARET, COUNTESS DOWAGER OF CUMBERLAND, ON THE 2d OF APRIL 1616: IN MEMORY WHEREOF SHE HATH LEFT AN ANNUITY OF &#163;4. TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE POOR OF THE PARISH OF BROUGHAM, EVERY 2d DAY OF APRIL FOR EVER, UPON THE STONE-TABLE PLACED HARD BY. LAUS DEO!</p>
<p>Her very hou&#8747;e-hold was a noble charity.  Her &#8747;ervants were generally the children of her tenants; and were &#8747;ure of a provi&#8747;ion, if they behaved well.  Her women-&#8747;ervants had always little portions given them, to begin the world with, if they married to plea&#8747;e her.</p>
<pb n="160"/>
<p>The calamities of the times al&#8747;o, during Cromwell's government, particularly the di&#8747;tre&#8747;&#8747;ed &#8747;ituation of &#8747;everal ejected mini&#8747;ters of the church, furni&#8747;hed her with ample opportunities of exerting her genero&#8747;ity.  Among others, &#8747;he was particularly kind to King, afterwards bi&#8747;hop of Chiche&#8747;ter; and Duppa, and Morley, both afterwards bi&#8747;hops of Winche&#8747;ter.  To each of the&#8747;e &#8747;he allowed 40&#163;. a year; and when, in their di&#8747;tre&#8747;&#8747;es abroad, they informed her, that a &#8747;um of money would be of more &#8747;ervice to them, than the annuities &#8747;he was plea&#8747;ed to give them; &#8747;he remitted a thou&#8747;and pounds to be divided among them.</p>
<p>She was a lady of uncommon prudence in the management of her affairs.  Be&#8747;hope Rainbow &#8747;ums up her character on this head, in two words, by calling her a perfect mi&#8747;tre&#8747;s of <i>foreca&#8747;t</i>, and <i>afterca&#8747;t</i>.</p>
<p>For the numberle&#8747;s acts of bounty, that flowed from her &#8747;he depended on two things -- 
<pb n="161"/>
her exactne&#8747;s in keeping accounts; and her great economy.</p>
<p>With regard to the former, in whatever ca&#8747;tle &#8747;he re&#8747;ided, an office was kept, in which all her receipts, and di&#8747;bur&#8747;ements were entered with commercial punctuality.  Of her private charities, &#8747;he kep an account her&#8747;elf: but was &#8747;o exact, that, at any time by comparing it with her public accounts, &#8747;he had, at once, a compleat view of the &#8747;ituation of her affairs.</p>
<p>Her economy was equal to her exactne&#8747;s.  Nothing was &#8747;pent in vanity.  Nothing was trifled away.  All her family-expences were under the article of nece&#8747;&#8747;aries: and the very form of regularity, in which they con&#8747;tantly ran, made one year a check upon another.</p>
<p>The &#8747;pirit, which &#8747;he &#8747;hewed in defending her rights, may perhaps be mentioned al&#8747;o among her plans of economy.  It was a &#8747;pirit not often exerted; but when it was rai&#8747;ed, it always carried her vigorously to the end of the que&#8747;tion; and, no doubt, &#8747;ecured her from many contentions, which might otherwi&#8747;e have di&#8747;turbed her, in the mid&#8747;t of &#8747;o complex a property; and in tho&#8747;e dubious
<pb n="162"/>
days, when legal rights were &#8747;o much unhinged.  I have mentioned her &#8747;pirit, in one &#8747;uit, with regard to an affair of con&#8747;equence.  We have an account of another of le&#8747;s importance.</p>
<p>It was a cu&#8747;tom, on all her e&#8747;tates, fro each tennant to pay, be&#8747;ides his rent, an annual <i>boon-hen</i>, as it was called.  This had ever been acknowledged a ju&#8747;t claim; and is, I believe, to this day, paid on many of the great e&#8747;tates in the north; being generally con&#8747;idered as a &#8747;teward's perquisite.</p>
<p>It happened, that a rich clothier from Halifax, one Murgatroyd, having take a tenement near Skipton, was called upon by the &#8747;teward of the ca&#8747;tle for his <i>boon-hen</i>.  On his refu&#8747;al to pay it, the counte&#8747;s ordered a &#8747;uit to be commenced again&#8747;t him.  He was ob&#8747;tinate; and &#8747;he determined; &#8747;o it was carried into length.  At la&#8747;t &#8747;he recovered her hen; but at the expence of 200&#163;. -- It is &#8747;aid, that after the affair was decided, &#8747;he invited Mr. Murgatroyd to dinner; and drawing the hen to her, which was &#8747;erved up as the fir&#8747;t di&#8747;h, "Come, &#8747;aid &#8747;he, Mr. Murgatroyd, let us now be good friends: Since
<pb n="163"/>
you al the hen to be dre&#8747;&#8747;ed at my table, we'll divide it between us."</p>
<p>She had mind improved, and cultivated in many parts of learning.  Dr. Donn, in his humourous manner, u&#8747;ed to &#8747;ay, <i>&#8747;he knew how to conver&#8747;e of every thing; from prede&#8747;tination to &#8747;lea-&#8747;ilk</i><ptr target="n35"/>.  But hi&#8747;tory &#8747;eems to have been her chief amu&#8747;ement; to the &#8747;tudy of which &#8747;he was probably fir&#8747;t led, by examining the hi&#8747;tory of her own ance&#8747;tors.  This indeed comprehended, in a great degree, the hi&#8747;tory of England from the times of the conque&#8747;t: for there were few &#8747;cenes of public life, in which her progenitors, the Veteriponts and the Cliffords, an active race of men, were not deeply engaged.</p>
<note id="n35">A kind of raw &#8747;ilk u&#8747;ed, at that time, in embroidery.</note>
<p>She &#8747;eems to have entertained a de&#8747;ign of collecting two materials for a hi&#8747;tory of the&#8747;e two potent northern families.  At a great expence &#8747;he employed learned men to make collections, for this purpo&#8747;e, from the records in the tower; the rolls; and other depo&#8747;itaries of
<pb n="164"/>
public papers; which being all fairly tran&#8747;cribed, filled three large volumes.  This work, which contains a great variety of original characters, exerting them&#8747;elves on very important occa&#8747;ions, exerting them&#8747;elves on very important occa&#8747;ions, is &#8747;till among the family-records at Appelby-ca&#8747;tle.</p>
<p>While &#8747;he was thus careful to pre&#8747;erve the honour of her ance&#8747;tors; &#8747;he in&#8747;tituted a very &#8747;evere hi&#8747;torical re&#8747;traint, if I am &#8747;o call it, on her&#8747;elf.  In a large folio volume, which made a part of her equipage, when &#8747;he travelled from one ca&#8747;tle to another, &#8747;he ordered an entry to be made, under her own in&#8747;pection, of the tran&#8747;actions of every day.  To what particulars this journal extended, I have not learned.  But if it was kept, as it probably was, by a confidential &#8747;ecretary, it might have included very minute particulars.  What an intere&#8747;ting collection of valuable anecdotes might be furni&#8747;hed from the incidents of &#8747;uch a life!  What a &#8747;atyr would it be on the vanity, the di&#8747;&#8747;ipation, and frivolous employments of the generality of the great!  This work, I am informed, is &#8747;till extant; and in the hands of the earl of Thanet.</p>

<p>But the mo&#8747;t con&#8747;picuous part of the character of this illu&#8747;trious lady, was her piety, and great attachment to religion.  No doubt the amiable in&#8747;tructors of her youth had given her di&#8747;po&#8747;ition, which was naturally &#8747;erious, a proper direction: but perhaps the be&#8747;t &#8747;chool, in which &#8747;he had learned to think ju&#8747;tly, was, that &#8747;chool of affliction, the hou&#8747;e of her &#8747;econd hu&#8747;band, the earl of Pembroke; who&#8747;e di&#8747;&#8747;ipated, abandoned life taught her, more than any thing el&#8747;e, the vanity of all earthly things, unle&#8747;s u&#8747;ed for the purpo&#8747;es they were given.</p>
<p>Few divines were better ver&#8747;ed in &#8747;cripture, than &#8747;he was.  She could quote it pertinently on all occa&#8747;ions; and never failed to read a portion of it every day; or have it read to her, in the latter part of her life.</p>
<p>The new te&#8747;tament was her principal &#8747;tudy.  Next to it &#8747;he was particularly fond of the p&#8747;alms of David; and had tho&#8747;e appointed for the day, read regularly to her.</p>
<p>She had been bred up in the church of England from her youth; and tho &#8747;he could not, in the fanatical times of the u&#8747;urpation, attend any public &#8747;ervice; yet in the wor&#8747;t
<pb n="166"/>
of tho&#8747;e times &#8747;he never failed to hear the church-&#8747;ervice in her own private chapels, which &#8747;he had been careful to fit up in all her ca&#8747;tles.  Many menaces of &#8747;eque&#8747;trations &#8747;he received from the ruling powers, if &#8747;he per&#8747;i&#8747;ted in that practice.  But &#8747;he &#8747;hewed the &#8747;ame &#8747;pirit on this occa&#8747;ion, which &#8747;he had &#8747;hewn on many others.  She continued her practice; and left them to do as they plea&#8747;ed.  No attempts however were made again&#8747;t her.</p>
<p>She had no idea of pomp, and grandeur.  With regard to her&#8747;elf, her mode of living was rather par&#8747;imonious.  Amid&#8747;t all the objects of her genero&#8747;ity, her&#8747;elf was the only per&#8747;on forgotten.  In her diet &#8747;he was even ab&#8747;temious; and would &#8747;ometimes plea&#8747;antly boa&#8747;t, that &#8747;he had &#8747;carce ever ta&#8747;ted wine, or phy&#8747;ick; during her whole life.  Of the elegance of dre&#8747;s &#8747;he had never been fond; but in her latter life &#8747;he laid it intirely a&#8747;ide; wearing nothing, for many years, but a clo&#8747;e habit of plain, black &#8747;erge; which occa&#8747;ioned many plea&#8747;ant mi&#8747;takes between her, and her attendants.</p>
<p>Her retinue was merely for u&#8747;e, not parade.  Be&#8747;ides her common dome&#8747;ticks, &#8747;he had al-
<pb n="167"/>
ways two ladies of education, who lived with her.  Many hours &#8747;he &#8747;pent alone: at other times, they read to her, and were her companions.</p>
<p>Her chief expence, as far as concerned her&#8747;elf, was in books.  Her library was &#8747;tored with all the be&#8747;t writers in the Engli&#8747;h language.  She knew no other.</p>
<p>Such was the life of this excellent lady; equally &#8747;uited to any &#8747;tation, in which God had plea&#8747;ed to place her.  It was a life of no more indulgence, than the mo&#8747;t abridged circum&#8747;tance would have allowed.  Her ability in doing good, was that only, in which &#8747;he exceeded others.</p>
<p>She lived twenty-&#8747;ix years, after the death of her &#8747;econd hu&#8747;band: Providence lengthening out her life, as a ble&#8747;&#8747;ing to the country, beyond her eightieth year.  The 23d of March 1675 was the day of her di&#8747;&#8747;olution -- one of the mo&#8747;t melancholy days the northern counties ever experienced.</p>
<p>In her ended the noble family of the Cliffords.  Her daughter Margaret, by the earl of Dor&#8747;et (her &#8747;ole &#8747;urviving heire&#8747;s) marry-

ing the earl of Thanet, carried the Clifford e&#8747;tates into the Tufton family<ptr target="n36"/>.</p>
<note id="n36">The mo&#8747;t material part of this little hi&#8747;tory is taken from a MS life of Mr. Sedgwick, her &#8747;ecretary, written by him&#8747;elf.

<p>FROM Appelby-ca&#8747;tle we &#8747;oon approach the barrier-mountains: but we approach them, in the u&#8747;ual order of nature, by regular progre&#8747;s.  The ground is fir&#8747;t high, before it becomes mountainous; and tillage appears in &#8747;canty plots, before cultivation cea&#8747;es.</p>
<p>A little to the north of Brugh, the ground on the left, makes a &#8747;ingular appearance.  A hill, on which a fair is annually held, forms an exact, &#8747;emi-circular convex.  Scarce a knoll, or bu&#8747;h break the regularity of the line.  Beyond this, but without any intervening ground, ri&#8747;es a range of di&#8747;tant mountains.  The&#8747;e wore a light purple hue, when we &#8747;aw them -- the circular hill, a deep green.  Perhaps no di&#8747;po&#8747;ition of ground was ever more totally
<pb n="170"/>
unpicture&#8747;que: and yet even this (&#8747;uch is the force of contra&#8747;t) if it be only bi&#8747;ected, and in a &#8747;mall degree adorned, is not wholly di&#8747;agreeable.</p>
<p>At the commencement of the mountains &#8747;tand the town, and ca&#8747;tle of Brugh, not unplea&#8747;antly &#8747;eated.  The ca&#8747;tle which con&#8747;i&#8747;ts, like that at Appelby, of two parts, &#8747;eems to have been a very &#8747;trong place.  Since the time of it's la&#8747;t noble inhabitant, the counte&#8747;s of Pembroke, it has been falling fa&#8747;t into ruin; but we found it no ea&#8747;y matter, even yet, to &#8747;cale the out-works of it's earthen mounds: &#8747;o &#8747;trong a fortre&#8747;s hath it once been. -- Some parts of it, e&#8747;pecially a &#8747;hattered round tower, are very picture&#8747;que.</p>
<p>We had not the opportunity of &#8747;eeing this ca&#8747;tle in &#8747;o advantageous a light, as had favoured us, when we &#8747;aw the ca&#8747;tle of Penrith.  We &#8747;aw them both in the evening; but here we had no bright beam of &#8747;un-&#8747;et to <i>illumine the ruins</i>.  And yet the effect was grand.  The ca&#8747;tle and land&#8747;cape around, were in deep &#8747;hadow; under the influence of a retiring &#8747;torm, which had hung a &#8747;ettled gloom on all
<pb n="171"/>
the upper regions of the &#8747;ky.  The &#8747;un was invi&#8747;ible; but had fired the whole we&#8747;tern horizon with a deep red.  We viewed the ca&#8747;tle from the ea&#8747;t; and had therefore the ruddy part of the hemi&#8747;phere as a back-ground to the grey tints, and &#8747;trong &#8747;hadows of the towers, and battlements, which intervened.  The&#8747;e, with the deep &#8747;olemnity of the gloom, were a &#8747;ufficient balance to the glowing red of the horizon, which would otherwi&#8747;e have been too glaring.  But the whole was in perfect harmony; and had a fine effect. -- Indeed nature's <i>colouring</i> is rarely without harmony.  If the lights be glowing, the &#8747;hades are proportionably deep: on the contrary, if the lights decay, the &#8747;hadows decay with them; and as light is also the &#8747;ource of colour, the land&#8747;cape wears always one uniform hue.  Either the <i>&#8747;ober colouring</i> prevails, or one <i>vivid tint</i> &#8747;upports another.  In <i>compo&#8747;ition</i>,<ptr target="n37"/> we have found, that nature may be improved; but in the beauty, and proportion of her tints, in the harmony
<pb n="172"/>
of her colouring, &#8747;he is an undeviating model of perfection.</p>

<p>The &#8747;quare tower, which made the grand part of the ca&#8747;tle, conveyed, as we looked into it, a very horrid idea.  Mo&#8747;t of the&#8747;e old &#8747;tructures have &#8747;uffered great <i>external</i> dilapidations.  But here the <i>shell</i> was intire; and all the <i>internal</i> parts were gone -- the roof, the &#8747;tories, and even the vault over the dungeon.  The whole was a mere excavation.  I know not, that I was ever &#8747;truck with a more horrid idea of the kind.  The eye, confined within the walls of a va&#8747;t tower, open to the &#8747;ky above, which loured with unu&#8747;ual blackne&#8747;s, looked down with hideous contra&#8747;t, deep into a dungeon below.</p>
<p>The whole road, over the mountains of Stainmore, from Brugh-ca&#8747;tle to Bowes-ca&#8747;tle, which is about thirteen miles, is the mo&#8747;t unplea&#8747;ant that can be conceived; and the more &#8747;o, as it reminded us of the &#8747;ublime &#8747;cenes, which we had pa&#8747;&#8747;ed, in another part of this chain, between Amble&#8747;ide and Ke&#8747;wick.</p>
