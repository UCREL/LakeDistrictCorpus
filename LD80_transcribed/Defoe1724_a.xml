<p> Lancaster is the next, the county town, and situate near the mouth of the River Lone or Lune.  The town is ancient; it lies, as it were, in its own ruins, and has little to recommend it but a decayed castle, and a more decayed port (for no ships of any considerable burthen); the bridge is handsome and strong, but, as before, here is little or no trade, and few people.</p> 
<p> This part of the country seemed very strange to us, after coming out of so rich, populous and fruitful a place, as I have now just described; for here we were, as it were, locked in between the hills on one side high as the clouds, and prodigiously higher, and the sea on the other, and the sea itself seemed desolate and wild, for it was a sea without ships, here being no sea port or place of trade, especially for merchants; so that, except colliers passing between Ireland and Whitehaven with coals, the people told us they should not see a ship under sail for many weeks together. </p>
<p> Here, among the mountains, our curiosity was frequently moved to enquire what high hill this was, or that. Indeed, they were, in my thoughts, monstrous high; but in a country all mountainous and full of innumerable high hills, it was not easy for a traveller to judge which was highest.</p>
<p> Nor were these hills high and formidable only, but they had a kind of an unhospitable terror in them.  Here were no rich pleasant valleys between them, as among the Alps; no lead mines and veins of rich ore, as in the Peak; no coal pits, as in the hills about Hallifax, much less gold, as in the Andes, but all barren and wild, of no use or advantage either to man or beast.  Indeed here was formerly, as far back as Queen Elizabeth, some copper mines, and they wrought them to good advantage; they are all given over long since, and this part of the country yields little or nothing at all. </p>
<pb n="550"/>
<p> But I must not forget Winander Meer, which makes the utmost northern bounds of this shire, which is famous for the char fish found here and hereabout, and no where else in England; it is found indeed in some of the rivers or lakes in Swisserland among the Alps, and some say in North Wales; but I question the last.  It is a curious fish, and, as a dainty, is potted, and sent far and near, as presents to the best friends. </p>
<p> Here we entered Westmoreland, a country eminent only for being the wildest, most barren and frightful of any that I have passed over in England, or even in Wales it self; the west side, which borders on Cumberland, is indeed bounded by a chain of almost unpassable mountains, which, in the language of the country, are called Fells, and these are called Fourness Fells, from the famous promontory bearing that name, and an abbey built also in ancient times, and called Fourness. </p>
<p> But 'tis of no advantage to represent horror, as the character of a country, in the middle of all the frightful appearances to the right and left; yet here are some very pleasant, populous and manufacturing towns.  Such as Kirby Launsdale, or Lunedale, because it stands on the River Lune, which is the boundary of the county, and leaves the hills of Mallerstang Forest, which are, in many places, unpassable.  The manufacture which the people are employed in here, are chiefly woolen cloths, at Kirby Launsdale, and Kendal, and farther northward, a security for the continuance of the people in the place; for here is a vast concourse of people.  In a word, I find no room to doubt the hills above mentioned go on to Scotland, for from some of the heights hereabouts, they can see even into Scotland it self. </p>
<p> The upper, or northern part of the county, has two manufacturing towns, called Kirby Stephen, and Appleby; the last is the capital of the county, yet neither of them offer any thing considerable to our observation, except a great manufacture of yarn stockings at the former. </p>
<p> When we entered at the south part of this county, I began
<pb n="551"/>
indeed to think of Merionethshire, and the mountains of Snowden in North Wales, seeing nothing round me, in many places but unpassable hills, whose tops, covered with snow, seemed to tell us all the pleasant part of England was at an end.  The great Winander Meer, like the Mediterranean Sea, extends it self on the west side for twelve miles and more, reckoning from North Bridge on the south, where it contracts it self again into a river up to Grasmere north, and is the boundary of the county, as I have said, on that side; and the English Appenine, that is, the mountains of Yorkshire North Riding, lie like a wall of brass on the other, and in deed, in one sense, they are a wall of brass; for it is the opinion of the most skilful and knowing people in the country, that those mountains are full of inexhaustible mines of copper, and so rich, as not only to be called brass, copper being convertible into brass, but also to have a quantity of gold in them also. </p>
<p> But notwithstanding this terrible aspect of the hills, when having passed by Kendal, and descending the frightful mountains, we began to find the flat country show it self; we soon saw that the north and north east part of the county was pleasant, rich, fruitful, and compared to the other part, populous.  The River Eden, the last river of England on this side, as the Tyne is on the other, rises in this part out of the side of a monstrous high mountain, called Mowill Hill, or Wildbore Fell, which you please; after which, it runs through the middle of this vale, which is, as above, a very agreeable and pleasant country, or perhaps seems to be so the more, by the horror of the eastern and southern part. </p>
<p> In this vale, and on the bank of this river, stands Appleby, once a flourishing city, now a scattering, decayed, and half-demolished town, the fatal effects of the ancient inroads of the Scots, when this being a frontier county, those invasions were frequent, and who several times were masters of this town, and at length burnt it to the ground, which blow it has not yet recovered. </p>
<p> The Roman highway, which I have so often mentioned, 
<pb n="552"/>
And which, in my last letter, I left at Leeming Lane, enters this county from Rear Cross upon Stanmore, and crossing it almost due east and west, goes through Appleby, passing the Eden a little north from Perith, at an ancient Roman station called Brovoniacam, where there was a large and stately stone bridge; but now the great road leads to the left-hand to Perith. </p> 
<p> Perith, or Penrith, is a handsome market town, populous, well built, and for an inland town, has a very good share of trade.  It was unhappily possessed by the late party of Scots Highland rebels, when they made that desperate push into England, and which ended at Preston; in the moor or heath, on the north part of this town, the militia of the county making a brave appearance, and infinitely out-numbering the Highlanders, were drawn up; yet, with all their bravery, they ran away, as soon as the Scots began to advance to charge them, and never fired a gun at them, leaving the town at their mercy.  However to do justice even to the rebels, they offered no injury to the town, only quartered in it one night, took what arms and ammunition they could find, and advanced towards Kendal. </p>
<p> From hence, in one stage, through a country full of castles, for almost every gentleman?s house is a castle, we came to Carlisle, a small but well fortified city, the frontier place and key of England on the west sea, as Berwick upon Tweed is on the east; and in both which there have, for many years, I might say ages, been strong garrisons kept to check the invading Scots; from below this town the famous Picts Wall began, which crossed the whole island to Newcastle upon Tyne, where I have mentioned it already.  Here also the great Roman highway, just before named, has its end, this being the utmost station of the Roman soldiers on this side. </p>
<p> But before I go on to speak of this town, I must go back, as we did for our particular satisfaction, to the sea coast, which, in this northern county, is more remarkable than that of Lancashire, though the other is extended much farther in length; for here are some towns of good trade. </p>
<pb n="553"/>
<p> I enquired much for the pearl fishery here, which Mr Cambden speaks of, as a thing well known about Ravenglass and the River Ire, which was made a kind of bubble lately.  But the country people, nor even the fishermen, could give us no account of any such thing; nor indeed is there any great quantity of the shell-fish to be found here (now) in which the pearl are found, I mean the large oyster or mussel.  What might be in former times, I know not. </p>
<p> Under this shire, the navigation being secured by this cape of St Bees, is the town of Whitehaven, grown up from a small place to be very considerable by the coal trade, which is increased so considerably of late, that it is now the most eminent port in England for shipping off coals, except Newcastle and Sunderland, and even beyond the last.  They have of late fallen into some merchandising also, occasioned by the great number of their shipping, and there are now some considerable merchants; but the town is yet but young in trade. </p>
<p> About ten miles from Whitehaven north east, lies Cockermouth, upon the little River Cocker, just where it falls into the Derwent.  This Derwent is famous for its springing out of those hills, called Derwent Falls, where the ancient copper mines were found in Queen Elizabeth's time, and in which it was said, there was a large quantity of gold.  But they are discontinued since that time, for what reason, I know not; for there are several copper mines now working in this county, and which, as they told me, turn to a very good account. </p>
<p> Some tell us, the copper mines on Derwent Falls were discontinued, because there being gold found among the ore, the queen claimed the royalty, and so no body would work them; which seems to be a reason why they should have been applied to the search with more vigour; but be that how it will they are left off, and the more probable account is, what a gentleman of Penrith gave us, namely that the charge of working them was too great for the profits. </p>
<p> Here we saw Skiddaw, one of those high hills of which, wherever you come, the people always say, they are the
<pb n="554"/>
highest in England,  Skiddaw indeed is a very high hill but seems the higher, because not surrounded with other mountains, as is the case in most places where the other hills are as at Cheviot, at Penigent, and at other places. From the top of Skiddaw they see plainly into Scotland, and quite into Dumfries-shire, and farther. </p>
<p> Cockermouth stands upon the River Derwent, about twelve miles from the sea, but more by the windings of the river, yet vessels of good burthen may come up to it.  This River Derwent is noted for very good salmon, and for a very great quantity, and trout.  Hence, that is, from Workington at the mouth of the river, and from Carlisle, notwithstanding the great distance, they at this time carry salmon (fresh as they take it) quite to London.  This is performed with horses, which, changing often, go night and day without intermission, and as they say, very much out-go the post; so that the fish come very sweet and good to London, where the extraordinary price they yield, being often sold at two shillings and sixpence to four shillings per pound, pay very well for the carriage. </p> 
<p> They have innumerable marks of antiquity in this county, as well as in that of Westmoreland, mentioned before; yet, passing these, I could not but take notice of two or three more modern things, and which relate to our own nation.  Such as, </p>
<p> 1. That of Hart-Horn Tree, where they showed us the head of a stag nailed up against a tree, or rather showed us the tree where they said it was nailed up, in memory of a famous chase of a stag by one single dog.  It seems the dog chased a stag from this place, (Whi[n]field Park) as far as the Red Kirk in Scotland, which they say is sixty miles at least, and back again to the same place, where being both spent, and at the last gasp, the stag strained all its force remaining to leap the park pales, did it, and died on the inside; the hound, attempting to leap after him, had not strength to go over, but fell back, and died on the outside just opposite; after which the heads of both were nailed up upon the tree. </p>
<pb n="555"/>
<p> 2. Another thing they told us was in the same park, viz. three oak trees which were called the Three Brether, the least of which was thirteen yards about; but they owned there was but one of them left, and only the stump of that; so we did not think it worth going to see, because it would no more confirm the wonder, than the people's affirming it by tradition only.  The tree or stump left, is called the Three Brether Tree, that is to say, one of the three brothers, or brethren. </p>
<p> 3.  West of this Hart-horn Tree, and upon the old Roman way, is the famous column, called the Countess Pillar, the best and most beautiful piece of its kind in Britain.  It is a fine column of free-stone, finely wrought, enchased, and in some places painted.  There is an obelisk on the top, several coats of arms, and other ornaments in proper places all over it, with dials also on every side. </p>
<p> [The] Countess of Pembroke had a noble and great estate in this country, and a great many fine old seats or palaces, all which she repaired and beautified, and dwelt sometimes at one, and sometimes at another, for the benefits of her tenants, and of the poor, who she always made desirous of her presence, being bettered constantly by her bounty, and her noble house-keeping.  But those estates are all since that time gone into other families. </p>
<p> 4. At Penrith also we saw several remarkable things, viz. (1.) Two remarkable pillars fourteen or fifteen foot asunder, and twelve foot high the lowest of them, though they seem equal. The people told us, they were the monument of Sir Owen Caesar. This Sir Owen, they tell us, was a champion of mighty strength, and of gigantic stature, and so he was, to be sure, if, as they say, he was as tall as one of the columns, and could touch both pillars with his hand at the same time.  They relate nothing but good of him, and that he exerted his mighty strength to kill robbers, such as infested the borders much in those days, others related wild boars; but the former is most probable. (2.) On the north side of the vestry of this church is erected in the wall an ancient square stone, with a
 <pb n="556"/>
memorial, intimating, that in the year 1598 there was a dreadful plague in those parts, in which there died: </p>

<p>But though I am backward to dip into antiquity, yet no English man, that has any honour for the glorious memory of the greatest and truest hero of all our kings of the English or Saxon race, can go to Carlisle, and not step aside to see the monument of King Edward I at Burgh upon the Sands, a little way out of the city Carlisle, where that victorious prince died. </p>
<p> Near this town, and as the inhabitants affirm, just on the spot where the king's tent stood in which he expired, for he died in the camp, is erected a pillar of stone near thirty foot high, besides the foundation.  This monument was erected by a private gentleman, for the eternal memory of a prince, who when he lived, was the darling of the world, both for virtue and true fame. </p>
<p> But I return to Carlisle : the city is strong, but small, the buildings old, but the streets fair; the great church is a venerable old pile, it seems to have been built at twice, or, as it were, rebuilt, the upper part being much more modern than the lower.  King Henry VIII fortified this city against the Scots, and built an additional castle to it on the east side; there is indeed another castle on the west, part of the town rounds the sea, as the wall rounds the whole, is very firm and strong.  But Carlisle is strong by situation, being almost surrounded with rivers. </p>
<p> Here is a bridge over the Eden, which soon lets you into Scotland; for the limits are not above eight miles off, or there- 
<pb n="557"/>
about.  The south part of Scotland on this side, coming at least fifty miles farther into England, than at Berwick.  There is not a great deal of trade here either by sea or land, it being a mere frontier.  On the other side the Eden we saw the Picts Wall, of which I have spoken already, and some remains of it are to be seen farther west.  But being now at the utmost extent of England on this side, I conclude also my letter, and am,</p> 
<p align="right"> SIR, &#38;c.</p>
