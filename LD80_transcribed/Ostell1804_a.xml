    <p align="center"> PREFACE.</p>
    <p>FROM a perusal of De Saussure's Travels in the Alps, I imbibed a very strong desire of viewing, a second time in my life, those stupendous monuments of nature. Thesudden renewal of hostilities with the French Republic, in March 1803, reudering such a journey impossible, I became anious to find out in Great Britain those sposts mostanalogous to the European Alps. It was not, however, without some diffi-culty, that I could conjecture what part of the island would be most productive of the species ofinformation I was in quest of. On the Continent, particularly in France and Germany, mineralogical works abound. In Great Britain, particularly the southern part of it,hardly any travels of <pb n="iv"/>of consequence that may serve as guides to the geologist are extant. If we except Mr. A. Aikin's Tour into North wales, Dr. Maton's into the Western Counties, and Mr. Mawes'into Derbyshire, scarcely any useful information on the subject of mineralogy occurs. It was reserved for an amiable and intelligent foreigner, M. Fauias de St. Fond, todescribe a part of the highly interesting Kingdom of North Britain; yet the Works of all these four Writers, however diligent and meritorious, must be like what I am aboutto produce, extremely imperfect and incomplete. And surely the reason is plain enough. In mountainous countries, a long residence in only one county, or province, is requisite.It is not sufficient for the Naturalist to frequent the public roads, traverse the Lakes, or explore the waterfalls; he ought, like the illustrious De Saussure, <i> "lemar-teau du mineur &#xE0; la main," </i> ascend the summit of every elevation in the district in which he is placed; nor ought this to content him, sometimes the minerals on one side of a mountain are wholly different<pb n="v"/>from that of the other, and many valuable observations that might have been made, may be lost by leaving any part of a mountain unseen, and many rare and useful minerals,from this circumstance, remains undiscovered. </p>
    <p> It is not easy to conceive the pleasure with which I set out on the journey about to be described. After having so often beholden private collections, the beau-tifulproductions of various countries of Europe, I could not help conjecturing that substances equally curious might be discovered in Great Britain. Is the lepi-dolite thoughtI, the exclusive product of Moravia? The apatite, or phosphate of lime, of Spain? The smaragdite of Dau-phiny and Carinthia? Is that most singular mineral, the jade, not to be found in some of our northern counties, either alone, or as near Geneva, intermixed with other substances constituting a granitel? May not the cyanite, or sappare,be found there as in the Isles of Shetland, or the Tyrol?<pb n="vi"/>Fired with these ideas, and anticipating perhaps too much the pleasure I was to receive from my excursion, I, with an eager-ness known only to those who are fond of natural history, took my departure from Barnet, where I had slept the preceding evening, in the Manchester coach, some time in the middle of June, 1803. </p>

      <i> Journey from London to Carlisle, and from thence to Keswick. </i>
    </p>
    <p> THE soil from Barnet to Wooburn is entirely, as throughout the greatest part of Middlesex, gravelly; at Dunstable the range of chalk hills, which rising in the countiesof Wilts, Somerset, and Dorset, cross the southern part of the kingdom in two directions, was here discernable: it forms a part of the same ridge with that which is tobe seen in Gloucestershire, Oxford-shire, and Bucks, nor does it here abruptly terminate, but extends still further to the east-ward, but where it ends, whether in thecounties of Suffolk or Norfolk, I am ignorant. The other branch from Wilts through the counties of Hants, Surrey, and Sussex, is stopt only by<pb n="2"/>the ocean; the whole, or at least the greatest part, of the isle of Thanet being almost entirely composed of chalk. But the branch in queftion ramifying from the samecounty of Wilts to the north of the Thames, is more involved in ob-scurity; I have not the least idea how far the chalk stratum extends this way. At Woobur commences a deep sandy declivity. We got out of our carriage to assist the horses. Sand stones for repairing the road, were lying on the road-side, and they continue with little orno interruption till a few miles beyond Northamp-ton. These sand stones contain frequently no small portion of the oxide of iron. I could not help remarking to myself,how, throughout al-most all the south of England, I had seen sand stone eminences were almosst the constant concomitants of chalk eminences. In no in-stance, perhaps, isthis more observable than in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire, where a stratum of sand stone from Kent, in the neighbourhood of Maidstone, traverses the counties ofSurrey and Sussex; acquires some degree of elevation in the neighbourhood of Midhurst and Petworth, and on the lofty chalk hulls between Midhurst and Arundel, its parallelismwith its chalky neighbours above it, and the direction it takes from east to west, <pb n="3"/>may be very clearly and distinctly viewed. Little remarkable occursi n the part of the county of Leicester through which we passed, or in the southern part of Derbyshire.At Ashbourn begins that district which is called the Peak. From hence to Buxton the soil was composed of sand stone, free stone, and lime stone, as yet no schistus appearednear the road. Buxton has been so often described, that it would be idle to give here a description of it. Let us hear what Mr. Mawe and Fauias de St. Fond say of it. Speaking of Buxton, says the former, "the traveller will be much surprised to see a building in this remote part of the kingdom that rivals the beauty of Palmira.""Buxton," says the latter, "is situated in the midst of the most dismal and cheerless country I ever saw. Its waters may be excel-lent, but most certainly its atmosphereis impregnated with sadness and melancholy. The houses almost entirely of an uniform appear-ance, resemble hospitals, or rather monastic establishments. A superb structure,executed in a grand and beautiful stile of architecture, which appears at the bottom of the place, and is appropriated to the baths, might be taken for the palace of theabbot." For my part I think the latter is nearest to the truth. It is cer- <pb n="4"/>tainly a cheerlefs, dreary tract, and unlike other mountainous countries is totally devoid of the picturesque. As you proceed from Bux-ton to Manchester, there are a fewachistose strata occasionally intersecting the lime and sand stone. In proportion as you advance to Manchester, the ground becomes less hilly, and at length you descendinto a fine plain; but you never entirely lose the sight of that branch of the mountains you have quitted, called long ago by Camden, the English Apennines. Sometimesthey gradually recide from your view, and often re-appear when you least expect them. This chain is more or less visible all the way to Lancaster, at a few miles fromwhich place it unites itself to the great tempestuous sea of mountains, occu-pying almost the whole of Westmoreland, and a very great part of the neighbouring county ofCumberland. </p>
    <p> Between Manchester and Chorley you have a most superb and interesting view, since you have not only these Apennines to the right, but to the west you have the Denbighshiremountains, thereby giving you, as on a map, a clear<pb n="5"/>idea of the vast plain that lies between these two ridges of mountains, which plainly shews that there is no continuity of chain. This country has been so ably describedby Dr. Aikin, in his History of Manchester, that little could have been added by me worth detailing, even had I staid any time in this singular country. I shall onlypermit myself a few observations presently on this subject, when speaking of the population of Manchester, and the general character of its inhabitants. Before you arriveat Manchester, you pass through Stock-port, a very thriving, flourishing town; the number of inhabitants here, it was told me, had in-creased in ten years from 6 to 25,000:so rapid an increase as this is surely not to be credited. Dr. Aikin, in 1794, estimates the population at 15,000. With so respectable a document as this in our hands,we may be certain, that whether the actual population be now 25,000 or not, (an assertion I have no means either of admitting or disproving,) it could not have quadrupledits numbers in ten years. This would making the Stockport women prolific in replenishing the earth, their Trans-atlantic sisters of Vermont and Kentucky. From<pb n="6"/>hence to Manchester you are perpetually put in mind of the filthy environs of London, particularly those of Camden Town, Somer's Town, and Islington. Stockport, as wellas Manchester, is built almost entirely of brick, and there are great quantities made in the neighbourhood; this resembles Middlesex again, where brick-making employssuch numbers of people. The town of Manchester is utterly unlike any other I have seen in Great Britain, or out of it. The streets, like those of Birmingham, soon acquirethat dirty and dingy hue for which the latter is so conspi-cuous. I should think, however, Birmingham the most preferable residence of the two, for those whose businessmight oblige them to re-sort to each of these places. They are certainly neither of them spots for those who are fond of exclaiming. </p>
    <p align="center"> Flumins amem sylvasque inglorius. </p>
    <p> Or for those who wish, </p>
    <p align="center"> Ducere sollicitae jucunda oblivia vitae. </p>
    <p> I know not how to compare Manchester, as I have just said, with any other town. I can-<pb n="7"/>not compare it well with any part of London; if it resembles any part of the metropolis, it is Aldersgate-street, and the Barbican; but then what the people who inhabitthese last are of a some-what genteeler stamp than those I stumbled on when at Manchester. it must be confessed, that all the Manchester men seem men of business; thereis not a person you meet who is an idler: not even at Amsterdam itself will you meet with people more occupied and indus-trious than here. There is great difficulty sometimesin procuring house-room at Manchester; this has happened to me thrice in my life, or I should not have noticed it. But I think it my duty, as well as that of every tra-veller to put people on their guard on this head, as invalids might be put to very serious incon-venience by it; and since I have quitted the place, I find what I havestated to be corrobo-rated by many others. This is no imputation against the character of inhabitants since so mercantile a place must of course be some-times more thanordinarily thronged. At length with very great difficulty I obtained, under certain conditions, a bed-room at the Bridgewater Arms, a most splendid and magnificent Inn, which, situated amongst the low<pb n="8"/>houses on all sides around it, looks like the pa-lace of some petty German Prince <ptr target="n1"/></p>
    <note id="n1"> I have since heard, that a very excellent inn has been lately built, almost expressly for strangers, the Commercial Inner. Had I known of this when atManchester, I might have saved myself much trouble. </note>
    <p> Leaving my quarters early next morning, to my no small satisfaction, we reached Bolton, a town greatly connected with Manchester, on account of the cotton spinningand weav-ing that is worked there for the Manchester markets. The streets of this town are equally low and dirty with those, which for the most part characterise thosewe left in the morning. The inhabitants too seem much on a par with respect to appearance. The same money scrap-ing, and retaining countenance, the same gait. One mighteven defy Lavater himself to fix any criterion whereby a Bolton, Stockport, or Manchester man should be distinguished from one another. The population of Manchester wasdescribed to me as having increased from 95,000 to 100,000, in the space of ten years. How do Dr. Aikin's and Fauias de St. Fond's account tally with this. Dr. Aikin's compu-tation in 1791, is 74,000. The latter gentle-man does not handle this subject with his usual<pb n="9"/>accuracy. "Manchester contains between 36 ad 40,000 inhabitants; but if the manu-facturers who live in its environs, were added to this number, the population would begreatly increased, and might be ranked with that of most cities of the second order." A recital that leaves us very much in the dark in respect to the question! </p>
    <p> What has contributed greatly to the increase of population for 30 miles round Manchester, had been th evast accession of strangers of late years. Of Irish particularlythere has been a great influx. Montesquieu, when on his travels he quits Genoa, thus expresses himself, </p>
    <p align="center"> Adieu! G&#xE9;nes detestable. </p>
    <p align="center"> Adieu! S&#xE9;jour de Plutus. </p>
    <p align="center"> Si le ciel m'est favorable </p>
    <p align="center"> Je ne vous reverrai plus. </p>
    <p> I will not say with this great man, that I never wish to see Manchester again, notwithstanding its various desagr&#xE9;mens, and that I believe as much incense to the fullis offered at the shrine of Plutus as here as at Genoa. But on considering the numerous estimable and scientific characters, who make this place their residence, whose acquaintance would confer <pb n="10"/>honour on any individual in the kingdom, I find it high time to put a stop to my railing. </p>
    <p> This manufacturing country reaches to the north even as far as the well-built town of Preston. Chorley has a very small share of the trade. On the banks of the Yarrow,which flows to the south of the town, are many bleaching and printing grounds, with cotton factories intermixed. </p>
    <p> The mine of Anglesark, five miles from hence, is no longer worked; whether the lead found there is not productive enough to pay the expence of the labour required forits ex-traction from its ore, or what is the existing cause I cannot tell. The lovers of mineralogy are not to be told by me, that that rare and useful mineral the carbonate of barites is found in this mine, and is peculiar to it, and two other spots in Great Britain: viz. Alstonmore in Cumberland, and Tyndrum in Scotland. </p>
    <p> The town of Lancaster is well built, but the houses being high, and the streets narrow, give it rather a gloomy appearance. The free-stone, which is procured froman extensive quarry at no great distance, is the material of which <pb n="11"/>all, or moft at least of the houses are built. It admits of a very fine polish. </p>
    <p> To the left on leaving Lancaster are several isolated calcareous hills. Farleton Knot, &amp;c. The country is tolerably fertile all the way to Kendal, soon after theleaving of which place a very wild scenery takes place, and lasts till within six miles of Penrith. This tract of country I have it not in my power to describe at present,but I am greatly deceived if it does not afford an abundant harvest to mineralo-gists. At Penrith you are past this moun-tainous district, and the country from hence toCarlisle is for the most part flat, though to the east,Tindal Fells, and to the west, those of Caldbeck, skirt the horizon. </p>
    <p> We arrived at Carlisle late in the evening of the 21st. The Bush Inn was found clean, and the charges were not immoderate. A variety of salmon they here call mort, of an exquisite flavour, was a very frequent dish, as well as at Kendal. An excellent custom prevails here as in many other towns of the north; people who arrive at aninn are not mistrustful or afraid of intermixing with strangers, as with us in the south. This, however, may be productive of<pb n="12"/>inconvenience in the south, on account of the multiplicity of bad characters to be found there; yet where it can be done without any risk, and with perfect safety, it iscertainly much more preferable to be in company than alone at an inn. Several foreigners joined us at the table, whilst I was at Carlisle, amongst the rest some Germansand a Dutchman. I saw nothing of that mean, illiberal, saracastic grin, which amongst the great and little vulgar of the south of England is ever sure to be displayed when a foreigner is present. That foreigner with them, if he is not an Englishman, must be a Frenchman. This species of logic is not much understood by the hardy native of the north; of if he knew it, would know it only to disdain. The laws of hospitality are not confined to Scotland alone. They are holden in equal veneration by thesegood people. I do not think it is in the nature of these worthy, plain hearted people to insult a stranger. </p>
    <p> Soon after my arrival I looked in vein for Skiddaw. The view of it was obstructed by Caldbeck Fells, which though lower than Skid-daw, prevent your seeing it till youare at the distance of two miles from Carlisle. </p>
    <pb n="13"/>
    <p> The ramparts are an agreeable walk enough, but they are sadly out of repair. It is to be lamented, that the inhabitants do not follow the example of those of Chester,who very wisely and patriotically set apart a sum for the maintenance of their ancient walls. Carlisle is upon the whole a very neat town, and the principal street is avery spacious one. I staid there but a short time, and after a journey of 300 miles, did not find myself disposed for any long excursion from it. I walked indeed to Brampton,which is in the same plain with Carlisle; had I proceeded farther on to Gills-land, I should have reached the little moun-tainous slip of country, there very narrow whichconnects the Scotch and the English mountains. The plain in which Carlisle stands, is bounded to the east and south by lofty mountains, at a vast distance; to the north,if we consider the plain, notwithstanding the inter-vention of the Solway Firth, as extending into Galloway, it is bounded by the Skruffelt and other Scotch mountains: to the west and south west, in which may be comprehended the towns of Wigton, Maryport, and Allonby, it is bounded by the Irish sea: all this western part is flat andvery fruitful. Lime is to be had there at no very unreasonable rate, and on considering the latitude of this part, I was much struck with the excellence of the crops. But what fixed my attention most, was the nature of the stone every where to be met with in the vicinity of Carlisle. This stone was of very various colours: it was blue, grey, greyish-blue, violet, red, reddish-brown, brown. No rain had fallen forsome days, and the road was so covered with dust that I could not examine the specimens on the spot so well as I could have wished. I tried, but in vain, to break thosestones; I soon afterwards found it was necessary to have a very large hammer to do it. These stones are the Trap of the Swedes, and Whin stones of the Scotch. Since M.St. Fond mentioned his having seen fragments of granite and basaltes between Carlisle and Kendal, I looked very carefully for specimens of these, but could find none. Itill becomes me to speak at large of Trap. Those who travel into this part of the island in quest of mineralogical knowledge, must be referred for further information toSt. Fond's Travels, who after having given to the world the account of provinces in his own country, greatly similar to this part of Britain, is a well qualified andintelligent guide.-Mr. Kirwen in his mineralogy mentions several varieties of Trap. Of all of these I must profess<pb n="14"/> my utter ignorance. Trap, Mullen, Wacken, Calp, <i> Krag </i>, &amp;c. It is singular that at Keswick, a labourer gave some specimens of Trap, lyingby the road side, this last appellation.</p>
    <p>From Carlisle to Wigton is eleven miles, through an highly cultivated country. Little is to be observed at Wigton, but that some of the houses built of brick, (the majorityare of stone) consist of three stories, each of these stories three yeards high, in all nine yards. They were built a few years after the rebellion in the late reign. FromWigton you have a fine view of Skruffelt to the right, the view however is soon lost, and you then proceed by the side of Bassenthwaite-water to Keswick, a drive aboundingpicturesque scenery. </p>

    <p> It is impossible when entering on a moun-tainous country, not to feel an animation and a cheerfulness which I believe to be peculiar to these delightful regions. Thisidea considered bby many as romantic, is fortified by the con-current opinions of so many eminent men, that to myself, who have long considered the subject, it appearsto me the very acm&#xE9; of folly to doubt of it. From whence arises this extreme salubrity? It is a super-abundance of<pb n="18"/>oxygen, azote, or hidrogen? Is it the relative density or rarefaction of the atmosphere? Few or none know, because few or none have at-tended to the subject. But thoughwe may all remain ignorant of the cause, we shall scarcely meet with any hardy enugh, I should imagine, to deny the beneficial effects result-ing from such an atmosphere. Mountainous countries have in all ages been conspicuous for producing illustrious men. Yes! It was surely amongst the Dalekarlian mountains that the great Gustavus Vassafirst imbibed the idea of rescuing his country from the hands of the tyrant Christian; at the foot of the Pyr&#xE9;enes that the fourth Henry of France first acquired that firmness and magnanimity of soul, which so well enabled him to appease the restless factions that had so long tormented his pre-decessor; from the bosom of cantons ofSchweitz and Unterwalden, that a William Tell was found to chastise the ferocious Albert. </p>
    <p> I did not rest even a single day at keswick, so eager was I to explore the adjacent country; on the next morning, then June the 25th, I walked around the lake: thefells, it would seem, that environed it, from the large rocks of stone hurled into<pb n="19"/>and by the side of it, were composed of quartz and schistus. In the quartz was imbedded galena (sulphuret of lead, N.C.) I had one specimen of it, which I have unfortunatelysince lost, where-in was a beautiful cubic crystal of this, which I was able entirely to detach from its matrix. I saw none of it in the fragments of schistus. </p>
    <p> June 26th. I walked to the entrance of Borrowdale. The rare plants I gathered in my way were <i> Pinguicula vulgaris, </i> not yet in flower, but those who have ever seen, or rather felt its unctuous succulent leaves, can never, I should think, again mistake it. <i> Narthecium ossifragum, </i> a beautiful and not very common plant,its root unlike that of most of its congeners, is not bulbous. Its beautiful scarlet auther&#xE6; seated on filaments likewise beautiful, must attract the notice and delightof every admirer of nature. On my return to Keswick I met some little girls, carrying with them large nosegays of the <i> Aquilegia vul-garis </i>, the varieties of itwere white and blue, and there was a purplish one, I was informed, growing in a wood on the margin of the lake. </p>
    <p> June 27th. I walked to Buttermere, by Newlands, with an intention to return through <pb n="20"/>Borrowdale. On the road picked up some white carbonate of lead, on quartz, that had plainly been detached from Newland-fells. The rocks seemed like those that surroundedDerwent-water, composed of quartz and schis-tus. The same sort of stones accompanied me all the way to Buttermere. Here is a neat little inn, the sign of the Salmon. Thescenery about Buttermere is truly sublime and august. On a promontory to the east of the lake, stands a house belonging to an attorney at Cocker-mouth, by the name ofBenson, one of the sweetest spots I ever beheld. Were I the owner of it I would not exchange it for Warwick, Blenheim, or Ainwick Castles; no, nt even for imperial Windsoritself. As you proceed on-wards, the scenery becomes uncommonly wild and savage; some few miles before you ap-proach Buttermere from Newlands, for a few paces even thefoot-path is lost, and it was not without some little difficulty I found it. This alone shews the very scanty population there must necessarily be amongst these bare rocks.Soon after you have left the lake of Buttermere, in your way to Borrowdale, you have a very steep and painful ascent to make, the road is so clogged up with large stones,that it would be with the utmost difficulty you could make<pb n="21"/>your way even on level road; but here it was more than ordinarily fatiguing; amig this sterile tract, however, grew the <i> Pinguicula vulgaris </i>, and <i> Alchemillaalpina </i>. Where you are arrived at the top of the hill, you are still as it were in a plain, when compared with the circum-jacent mountains. Here indeed, as much asany where in the world, may we say, </p>
    <p align="center"> Hinc atque hinc vast&#xE6; rupes, gemin que minantur </p>
    <p align="center"> In c&#xE6;lum scopuli. </p>
    <p> You enjoy however here some cool breezes. The weather had been insufferably hot in the lower regions of the atmosphere, and I enjoyed a most agreeable respite afterI had reached the summit, and I sat down on a block of schist to contemplate the surrounding scenery. All was silence and horror. Not an habitation to be seen. I turnedround to look at the country I had lately quitted, it was intercepted by lofty mountains; the lake was entirely lost to my view. </p>
    <p> People who have travelled into other countres are fond (and it is natural enough) of drawing resemblances between one country and another, and too frequently when nosuch <pb n="22"/>resemblances exist, thereby deluding others as well as themselves. Nature, ever varied, seems to set at nought such comparisons; when therefore I say, in the course ofmy route from Buttermere to Borrowdale, I was often reminded of the frightful province of Blekinge, in Sweden, I must be permitted to speak with some modifications. Itis true that immense labyrinth of fir which overspreads the greater part of the north-east of Europe, was wanting in the landscape, so were the red wooden houses. Thecountry too of Blekinge, like that of all the south of Sweden, is, though granitic, only rocky, not mountainous. When therefore I mean to say I was reminded me of thatprovince, not the <i> tout ensemble </i>, which only resembles it in being perfectly sterile, con-sisting of bare rugged rocks, almost entirely de-void of verdure. Thedesceent from this fell, the name of which I have not now in my head, is scarcely less precipitous than its ascent. The same stony road as before: nothing to be heardbut the sound of waterfalls, which sometimes dashed themselves across the road I was passing. Almost exhausted with fatigue, and intolerably thirsty, I soon becamerecruited by means of an universal and useful fluid, in a place<pb n="23"/>where nature seemed to refuse all other suste-nance but this her amples and kindest donative. </p>
    <p> I descended into Borrowdale through a thick wood-close to a fine fall of water and the scene was as instantly changed from the grand and terrific to the tranquil andbeautiful. I would recommend to all pedestrians, like my-self, rarely or ever to taste any spirituous li-quor during their excursions to the Fells, at least very little.I had some excellent ale at the inn at Buttermere, but this though it may assuage thirst for a time, is not, as I have found by long experience, half so strengthen-ing as milk, which is excellent in all moun-tainous countries. It would also be advisable for him to take a can, or some eother utensile not liable to break, with himon the moun-tains. This counsel may appear puerile to those who have never been accustomed to travel in these rugged tracts, but let them con-sider, by not paying dueattention to these cir-cumstances, that many may be induced to stop short on their tour from the immoderate thirst they may experience, and thereby lose a great deal ofpleasure themselves; and if they are fond of natural history, the public will not be benefited by any researches they might<pb n="24"/>otherwise make. I passed by the famous Bow-der-stone, which too put me in mind of Ble-kinge, where a similar isolated stone presents itself in the road from Malmoe toCarlscroon. The Bowder-stone is of schist. </p>

    <p> I returned in the evening by Lodore to Keswick. </p>
    <p> June 29. I went to Withburne, and dined there in company with three other travellers whom I found seated at table on my arrival, and who immediately asked me to partakeof their fare, to which invitation I without the smallest reluctance assented. The charges for dinner were very moderate, only fourteen-pence per head; with many otherdishes were potted perch, or bass, as it is termed here, mutton-ham, hung-beef, and preserved gooseberries with excellent cream. The accomodations at this inn are not sogood as at Keswick, but I made a very good dinner there. One of the <pb n="25"/>Gentlemen who took up his quarters here for the purpose of fishing in the adjoining lake, and in the numerous tarns to be found in the neighbouring mountains here, had colletedsome stones I saw in the window: he very oblingingly offered me any of them I might chuse to take; I accepted of him a greenish stone of a moderate hardness, sprinkledwith blackish specks of some other substance, which I after-wards found to be chert, penetrated by schor-laceous actinolite, to which its colour might be ascribable,having in it minute portions of horn blende. This Gentleman, not content with giving me this specimen, accompanied me to the borders of the lake near to which it wastaken. It was probably a fragment of rock from Helvellyn, frowning tremendously above us just at this period. We proceeded to that part of Leathe's water where the lakeforms itself into a strait, and across which a foot-bridge is thrown, for the convenience of those who wish to pass on to the western border of the lake; you may then,if you are so inclined, proceed southwards back again to Wythburn, or Grasmere; but you cannot proceed north-wards on the western side to Keswick. The ragged mountainsthat overhang this part of the lake, rendering a road there almost impos-<pb n="26"/>sible. It was at this strait that parted the lake into two nearly equal divisions, that  Istopped for some moments to behold the very wild as-pect of the upper or northernpart of it. it is viewed with tenfold advantage here: you have no idea of its wildness from the public road. It was from viewing it at this, or some other spot not fardistant from it, that perhaps Mr. Cumberland was induced, very aptly and justly, in his beautiful poem, to call it by the name of the "savage" Wythburn. We soon after regained the Keswick-road, at five miles and a half from that town, and on my return thither I picked up the <i> Veronica serpyllifolia </i> and <i> Ge-ranium pratense. </i>They had just begun to cut their hay hereabouts. </p>
    <p> July 2nd. I set off with a Gentleman at Keswick, in his gig to Cockermouth. A de-lightful drive abounding in very varied scenery. Slight glimpses of Keswick and Bassenthwaite Lake, and of the mountains which encompasse Lowe's water, added to the beauty of the land-scape. A few miles from Cockermouth we en-tered into a more fruitfulcountry, but it is not by any means so flat as in the neighbour-houd of Wigton. The hills about Cocker-mouth are of no extraordinary heighth. This is <pb n="27"/>a town, the streets of which are most of them vary spacious, and near to it is a beautiful public walk, commanding an extensive pro-spect. The road from hence to Ouse-bridgeis over an open extended heath, till you ap-proach Ouze-bridge, where the lake of Bas-senthwaite opens very advantageously to your view; and I should prefer this placeto Lowood, Wyburn, or even Grasmere itself, were it more centrally situated, by which term I mean, were it better adapted for mountainous excur-sions. The views from hence to Keswick are some of them very charming. </p>
    <p> July 3d. Seventeen years had now elapsed since I had seen Ambleside, Grasmere, or Rydal. I entered that district of country with no small degree of enthusiasm. At thefoot of Helvellyn I had occasion to observe the greenish stone I before spoke of, and likewise many specimens of it where the horn blended was wanting, and cavities ofprecisely the shape which the hornblende, it is probable, formerly occupied, were discernible in these stones; some of them I picked up were lying in the road, and othersin the stone wallsof this country, where, as in Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, and other counties of the south, walls and <pb n="28"/>not hedges and the boundaries of property. The inn at Grasmere, where I dined, is a neat one, and they are making considerable im-provements there; and this too I oughtto have said is the case at Ouse-bridge. </p>
    <p> The schistose mountains, which accompany you all the way from Keswick, however occa-sionally intermixed with other substances, as I have mentioned at the foot of Helvellyn, attend you all the way to Ambleside; it must however be remarked, that though almost entirely schis-tose, they there become visibly lower, and I con-fidentlyanticipated somewhere at the southern point of Winandermere, mountains of an in-ferior origin, viz. the calcareous. </p>
    <p> I slept at Ambleside, and the next morning proceeded to Lowood Inn, two miles from thence, after having first seen Mr. Green's most excellent collection of drawingsof the lakes, which every one has an opportunity of viewing, at the moderate price of a shilling. I recommend particularly to the traveller's at-tention, the views of Wast-water, the moun-tains that encompass which, must surely from their form be granitic. His views of Ennerdale, <pb n="29"/>Buttermere, and Cromack Waters, are also most deservedly admired. The plants I saw, or ga-thered in the road from Keswick to Lowood, were the following: <i> Pinguiculavulgaris </i> though not in flower, everywhere about Wyth-burn, and between Grasmere and Ambleside, were the <i> Sedurn anglicum, </i> <i> Teucrium scorodo-nia, </i> and a species of <i> Epilobium </i> I am not con-fident to be the <i> Alpinum. </i> After spending a few days at Lowood, (which recalled to my mind many tender recollectionsof past events, as I strayed on the banks of Winandermere) I returned by precisely the same rout to Kes-wick. </p>

      <i> Mr. Cresthwaite's Museum. </i>
    </p>
    <p> I HAD not been long at Keswick before the following paper was put into my hands; I shall transcribe only a part of it, since the beginning of it can only be usefulto those who may ar-rive at Keswick for the purpose of visiting the lakes, wherein every thing they mmay have need of on their journey is there enumerated. </p>
    <p align="center"> PETER CROSTHWAITE, </p>
    <p align="center"> Formelry Naval Commander in India, </p>
    <p align="center"> Surveyor, and Seller of the Maps of the Lakes </p>
    <p align="center"> Master of the celebrated museum, </p>
    <p align="center"> (of twenty-one years standing,) </p>
    <p align="center"> At the Quadrant, Telescope, and Weathercock, </p>
    <p align="center"> A little below the middle of Keswick, </p>
    <p align="center"> Returns thanks to the Nobility, Gentry, &amp;c. </p>
    <p> And particularizes the articles he has to dispose of. The latter part of the advertisement is more in the plaintive stile. </p>
    <pb n="31"/>
    <p>"P. Crosthwaite has also lately discovered a medical water, not many miles from Keswick, a specimen of which he exhibits in his Museum, with some trophies of its healingpowers; and which for purity exceeds the celebrated springs of Malvern-hills, in the proportion of four to one at least; and its power in healing, (which he has tried uponfour different patients,) bids fair to vanquish even the gout itself, when a due regard is paid to its use, and the non-naturals! a pleasant medicine; the most mild, andperhaps the most powerful too, which was ever put in practice. </p>
    <p> "N.B. The Gentry are desired to beware they are not led to a wrong place when they ask for his Museum, (which is frequently the case,) because five years after hisMuseum was esta-blished, at a great expense of money and time, a junto in the town informed him, if he would drop the guide business, they would send the Gentry of theMuseum; he agreed, and a few months after they opened what they called a Museum against him; and actually make it pass for his; being (with much ingra-titude, and Cain'scomplaint) bent on cutting him off at all points! And it is thought, if it had not been for the above scheme, and that of seizing privately on curiosities coming to him,<pb n="32"/>they had never made the attempt in this small place: as it is well known, that London itself did not even support one capital Museum. They also impose, by selling unlawful,worth-less pretended maps of the Lakes!-And all this can be easily proved." </p>
    <p> I could not leave Keswick without paying my compliments to this Gentleman, who ap-peared to be so ill treated by his fellow towns-men. I accordingly one morning proceededto his house. There is no difficulty whatever in finding it. Two enormous whale jaws placed before the door, announce the mansion of this proprietor of every thing mostprodi-gious in human nature, of this illustrious and consummate virtuoso. On my entrance into the outer room I expected to find the skeleton of the monstrous animal I hadleft behind me without doors, a Rhinoceros, or an huge stuffed Alligator! But a being of a very different na-ture, of an aspect infinitely more placid and benign, witha white wand in her hand, made her appearance. it was the wife of the Admiral. <ptr target="n2"/></p>
    <note id="n2"> Those who wish for a description of a diversion ccalled the regatta, may be referred to a note in West's Guide Book, where the proceedings at this amusementare very amply detailed. There Mr. Crosthwaite, resuming his former habits of life, leads his victorious bands to Pocklington's island, where he and his comrades, wellragaled with roast beef, plumb-pudding, and other good things, then return in triumph to Keswick; and the next morning no traces of the Admiral's warlike habits remain; he is then again the quiet scientific virtuoso. He thinks this regatta very good fun. So do the fair sex. The young ladies are very often married by it; and the old onesget a rubber of whist extra-ordinary. </note>
    <pb n="33"/>
    <p>I followed my conductress up stairs, but had scarcely reached the top of them, when she ap-plying her wand to a large Chinese gong that was hanging near the entrance ofthe room, made the whole house vibrate with the sound. I had but just recovered from the state of stu-pefaction I had been thrown into, when wav-ing her wand, she was proceeding to explain to me the contents of the museum, with an eloquence and volubility not to be exceeded by any of the exhibitors of the British Museum, Stedfastlylooking in the fact of my Urganda, I most humbly conjured her, for a few moments t desist. I could not help observing to her, that the knowledge of the curiosities herhus-band had been so many years in amassing,<pb n="34"/>could not be conveyed to my shallow intellect in the short space of time she had allotted me; but that we would manage the matter, if it pleased her, in a different manner,by way of question and answer. Having both of us agreed on this dialogue scheme, we went on much better, though not with such rapidity as before; our conversation wassoon inter-rupted by the arrival of her son, who then by general consent became my Cicerone. She would however on no account consent to deliver up her wand, which stillbrandishing as she retired, she continued to wield with inimitable skill and adroitness. </p>
    <p> We now went on still more quietly than before; I found young Mr. Crosthwaite perfectly civil and obliging. Though he did not seem to inherit a spark of his father's literary talents, yet we well know </p>
    <p align="center"> Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum. </p>
    <p> And he upon the whole seems very well con-tent to be either with or without his father's learning. </p>
    <p> The museum here, I must say, reflects the highest honour and praise on Mr. Crosthwaite. <pb n="35"/>Here is every thing to be found almost with a stranger would wish to be informed of: but the great misfortune is, the fossils are very few of them arranged, and the troublethis gives those who are really desirous of making them-selves acquainted with the production of this much to be envied country, is indescribable. The foreign birds most to beadmired here, were the Toucan and albatross, in high preser-vation; the most remarkable of the indigenous was a golden crested wren. Among the fossils best arranged werethose that came from Alston Moor. Some very large crystals of sulphate of barite are particularly deserving of notice. Mr. Crosthwaite, besides the attention he has givento the increase of his museum, has not been un-mindful of the health of his fellow countrymen. In a treatise, which has for its object not only the health, but theaugmentation of the capacity of the inhabitants of the vale of Keswick, he strenuously recommends them air, and to well drain their vale. He thus in his Treatise ex-presshimself. "This great work being finished, and a few months allowed for the breathing better air, you will see fewer dis-eased people; the workhouse less crouded; infantchildren begin to run some weeks<pb n="36"/>sooner; the ten years olds display more agility at their play and their labour; the young men and maidens at the prime of life, will display more vigour, more resolution,more activity, and more virtue too: the aged crowned with grey hairs will begin to revive in some degree, and in the long run make a better and more grateful exit. </p>
    <p> "More corn and more hay, and of a better quality; more kine and more sheep, and these more sound, will be another consequence, and many other good things will follow." </p>
    <p> It is impossible I should think, not to ap-plaud the endeavours of this beneficent philan-thropist, to improve the <i> mental,</i> as well as bodily powers of thepeople of Keswick. So far from wishing to interrupt the progress of his undertaking, I wish some method could be de-vised, either by <i> draining, </i> or some other modeof improving the capacities of the whole king-dom, as it must be confessed our great men have of late years stood much in need of it ever since the death of the memorable,and much to be lamented Earl of Chatham. I shall conclude in the words of the literary <pb n="37"/>veteran so often alluded to, particularly as it coincides very much with what I have written in the present chapter.</p>
    <p> "As I have written this with some hopes of success, and found many people very desirous the work should be done, I have written it with pleasure; wish I could havewritten better; hope it will offend no man: and remain the public's very humble servant:" so am I, most profoundly and obsequiously. </p>

      <i> Mr. Hutton's Museum. </i>
    </p>
    <p> IT has always been my rule through life, never hastily to take upon trust the character that one man gives to another. Many mo-tives may contribute to make suchan one en-hance the good qualities of an individual, and more may concure to make him depreciate them. I say, reversing this maxim, and constantly keeping it in view,as much as it lies in my power, it is not at all surprising, I should visit the rival museum of that I had seen; more especially when I had far other motives in viewthan that of indulging an idle curiosity. I therefore went there. It is kept by a person of the name of Hutton. It must be confes-sed that though the curiosities atHutton's are less numerous than those at Mr. Crosthwaite's, a person, in quest of real information, will reap as much knowledge from the one as the other, as the minerals,though small in number, are better arranged. I shall give some short ac-count of a few of the minerals I saw in his<pb n="39"/>cabinet, blended with a narration of what may be expected by a traveller who wishes to see the stones themselves in the places from whence they were taken, viz. the defiles and crevices of the mountains. </p>
    <p> Skeddow was said by Hutton to consist of, besides schistus and quartz, grey granite, white jasper, and agate with quartz; both these last very rare. Sometimes in thegray granite schoerl was to be met with, and then of course it assumed the name of granitell. The summit of this mountain, he said was schistose, inter-sected by a veinof quartz, about three yards thick, nearly perpendicular to the horizon.-Latrig Skiddaw's cub, as it has been called, was composed of quartz and schistus.-Saddle-back,he said, of schistus, quartz, and basaltic hornblende. </p>
    <p> Helvellyn was composed of schistus, quartz, Trap, and the greenish stones I have twice had occasion to speak of in the course of my tour. There is no granite on Hellvellyn, though prophyries have been occasionally found there. On the west side of Mell Fell schistus was to be found, and on the east white lime stone. On BorrowdaleFells were to be<pb n="40"/>Trap, Mullen, and porphyry, and but very little granite. Basanite, he said, was to be found on this side of Buttermere, and not on the other side of that water; and granite,<i> &#xE8; converso, </i> on that side, and not on this. On Stake was to be found Trap, Mullen, and schistus. Lang-dale Pikes are composed nearly of the same materials; neitheron these two last, nor on Eagle Crag is any granite. Wry-Nose and Hard-Knot, are nearly of the same composition, he informed me, as the three last. When you approachWast Water, at the east end you have Rowley Rag, and Trap, at the western, lime stone. A solid mass of granite runs up from Blae Crag to Red Pike, and at Mell Break issome granite, and bog iron ore, with the same greenish chert as on Helvellyn; and at High-Stile is Trap again, and schistus. A stratum of granite runs from Red Pike, asdoes one of Trap and schistus to Ennerdale. As you go from Ennerdale towards Whitehaven the lime-stone stratum commences, and extends to near Cockermouth. Honister-Cragis entirely of schist. Near Raven-Glass is both granite and lime-stone. Whinlater is of quartz and schistus. Grasmire-Hill, and White-Side, are of schistus, with someparticles of red granite. At Castle-Rig, in Borrowdale, is a large vein<pb n="41"/> of Calcedony in Trap, and native arsenic is to be seen on the Buttermore mountains. Some schoerl may be found in the liberties of Borrow-dale. Wolfram too he discoveredbetween Borrowdale and Buttermere; and gueiss in the river Greta. This very diligent man has dis-covered cobalt and micaceous iron ore, between Buttermere and Borrowdale;and sulphuret of antimony to the left of Armathwaite. I had this account verbatim from Mr. Hutton. I trust I have no need to make any apology to such of my readers who are fond of the subject I have been expatiating upon, in particular-izing so minutely the component parts of each mountain. The fact is, it having been my in-tention tohave staid a much longer time at the Lakes than I did, I copied the foregoing account of Hutton for my own convenience, to be enabled with his assistance, or that of someother guide, to visit the spots themselves from whence some of the specimens in the museum had been dislodged. As it is now very improbable I shall soon revisit this en-chanting country, I conceive the account I have just prefixed may be serviceable to any future traveller, firmly imbued with the enthu-siastic desire of seeing the productionsof nature on the very spots from whence they <pb n="42"/>have been taken. I have then given him his bill of fare, and such an one will perhaps think, that the foregoing catalogue is neither useless, nor too prolix. He oughthowever to be ad-vertised, that Hutton being the most intelli-gent guide in Keswick, is so much occupied from the beginning of June to the latter end of September, inescorting visitors to the Lakes, in the common routine, they most or all of them go (the number of which is now very great) that he can but seldom spare time for expeditions to any very remote sequestered parts. The best time, therefore, for visiting the mountains I have cited, is April, May, and October, when he is perfectlyfree from any other avocation. </p>
    <p> I proceed now to state a few more articles in Hutton's museum, for the sake of those who wish to visit is solely as an object of curiosity. </p>
    <p> Beautiful white, black, greenish black, in short, variously coloured jade pebbles, from St. Bees, about the size of a pullet's egg. They were found in a cave there,now a dry one, but every one must see from their shape, that it was formerly caused by the action of either sea or fresh water, which had worn off their <pb n="43"/>angles. That they must have suffered some attrition is manifest, and I know of no agent but this that could have done it. In some of the specimens were minute particles of white, and in others of red feltspar. These might be deno-minated either prophyries or granitells, ac-cording to the system each eaminer probably had before pursued. Redgarnet crystals in Trap, from near Buttermere; beautiful carbonate of lead, from Newlands; it is not possible for words to describe the elegance of this Talc in granitefrom about Penrith (probably from Cross Fell.) </p>
    <p> I saw likewise an amorphous specimen of jade, which Hutton found near Keswick (he could find many in a day if he chose, he said, from the size of an egg to his head).He seemed very much surprized when I hinted to him their intrinsic value. </p>
    <p> The greenish granite, mentioned by Mr. Mawe, in his Derbyshire Tour, turned out to be a porphyry. Schistus, I was here told, that could be well wrought, acquired herethe pro-vincial term of metal; and that which could not, Hutton said, had certainly particles of Trap intermixed with it. The matrices of plumbago, <pb n="44"/>I was informed, were so various, that it was almost impossible to recite them all, the most usual were, Trap, calcareous earth, and Sidero-cal-cite. The plumbago itselfis generally found in Nodules, of an oval or elliptic form. Fine crystals of sulphate of barite, the same as at Mr. Crosthwaite's, from Alston Moor. They were so largethat I wished to have them weighed. Their weight proved to be 2st. 10lb. But what above all rivetted my attention, were some small brilliant diaphanous quartz crystal,that, like the diamond, would cut glass, from the Diamond Hill (as it has been stiled) at Downham, in Lancashire, belonging to Wil-liam Asheton, Esq. of Downham andCuerdale. Downham is near the north foot of Pendle Hill. There were similar specimens of these crystals, with red oxide of iron in them, which made them look more beautifulthan rubies. Both Born and Scopoli describe these varieties of quartz so accurately, that I cannot refrain from giving the description of them in their own words. </p>
    <p> Quartzum crystallizatum purum Hexahed-rum diaphanum, utrinque pyramidatum, column&#xE2; null&#xE2; intermedi&#xE2; crystallis solitariis, &#xE8; marmoros Transilvani&#xE6;. Litop.

    <p> These varieties are not confined to Hungary, Transilvania, or the West Riding of Yorkshire; but according to Mr. Rome de Lisle, are to be found also in Italy, Sweden,France, and Spain. Their shape may be seen in the nine-teenth figure of the sixth plate of the last mentioned author. </p>

The eagles have now entirely left this country, whether they are gone to Scotland, Ireland,Snowdon, or a longer journey, I have<pb n="47"/>no opportunity of ascertaining. The <i> Ampelis Garrulus </i> was shot with five of his comrades some few years ago. It can hardly be called a British bird, I think, asit so very unfre-quently pays us a visit. Its plumage is exces-sively beautiful. It would not appear to be a very common bird in France, as Buffon him-self has stiled it <i> "le jaseur de bch&#xE9;me." </i> </p>
    <p>Hutton's garden contains many uncommon plants, particularly of the gynandrous class, amongst the rest, that very rare, and I hope not extinct plan in Great Britain, <i>Cypripedi-um calceolus. </i> This, in my opinion most beau-tiful of the English plants, was not in flower. Here too was <i> Papaver Cambricum, </i> not pecu-liar to Wales,as the term would seem to imply, but flourishing vigorously in this country. Many rare <i> Seda </i> and <i> Saxihrag&#xE6;, </i> <i> Geranium San-guineum, </i> <i> TrolliusEurop&#xE6;us, </i> <i> Gnaphalium Di-oicum, </i> &amp;c. I ought not here to forget to mention, that there is an excellent collection of lichens in one of the rooms at Hutton's. </p>

      <i> A few thoughts on Jade. </i>
    </p>
    <p> As in zoology, the Penguin and the Exoc&#x160;tus vo-litans seem to connect the class of the aves and pisces, the Armadillo those of the mammalia and amphibia, vespertilioquadrupeds and birds, and Phoc&#xE6; quadrupeds and fishes, so in mineralogy the jade seems to be an intermediate link between the Magnesian and Siliceous ge-nera. What substances can be more different from each other than Tale and quartz, amian-thy and jasper, asbestus and flint! Yet the jade yields neither to Tale, amianthus, or asbes-tus,in softness to the touch, and is not only superior in hardness to quartz, jasper and flint, but also to every other substance (as will be more fully related) that canpossibly be classified amongst the earths. This stone appeared to me too important to be passed over in silence, I have therefore dedicated this short chapter <pb n="49"/>to it, ardently hoping that it may not prove tiresome to the generality of the readers, but on the contrary incite them to a more strict exa-mination of this wonderfulfossil. I know of no English writer that has expressly treated of this subject, and no wonder, since I believe it to be confined in Great Britain, to Scotland, and the four most northern English counties. As far as I recollect, Dr. Maton makes no men-tion of it in Cornwall, where the soil is in some parts so completely magnesian. InMr. Aikin's book, which I have very lately perused, there is no account whatever of it iin North Wales, though Carnavonshire and Denbighshire are represented to aboundin serpentine of a very beautiful kind. </p>
    <p> I am therefore constrained to betake myself to foreign authors for further information on this subject. The first thing to be noticed of this fossil is, that it has never yet been found of any determinate shape, always amorphous, never exhibiting the slightest sign of crys-tallization. It is almost always half transpa-rent, and of very various colours; its surface brilliant; its most ordinary colorus are a milky white, grey, olive green, sometimes of a deeper, <pb n="50"/>sometimes of a lighter shade, sea green. <ptr target="n3"/> The handles of many Turkish sabres are made of this substance, which comes from the East, where it is foundmore plentifully, and I have reason to believe exists there in large masses. Whereas in Europe, to the best of my know-ledge, it has only been discovered in scattereddetached fragments.</p>
    <note id="n3"> Between Aix and Avignon, De Saussure found speci-mens of a pale violet, and this is may be presumed is the rarest variety. </note>
    <p>M. de Saussure is tempted to refer to the genus of steatite, a singular species of jade, to be met with in the the environs of Geneva, and even in considerable blocks,<i> but never pure. </i> "The hardness of this stone," says he, "is very great, superior even ot that of silex; and the coherence of its parts greated than that of anyother stone I am acquainted with. It is extremely difficult to break it; it resists the best and strongest hammers, which are not only blunted, but even broken by it.One cannot," adds he, "refuse to this stone the name of jade. It has all the characters of it; its exterior surface looks as if it had been po-lished, and is unctuous tothe touch; its frac- <pb n="51"/>ture resembles very much congratulated oil, its yellowish colour, and half transparency, still more augments this resemblance." I make haste to speak of the pretendedvirtues ascribed to this fossil, in curing those most excruciating maladies the gravel and stone, which has given it the silly pompous appellation of lapis ne-phriticus,and of "pierre divine," by the French. I have already said, that De Saussure describes the jade to be rarely or ever met with pure. It is very common, however, it appearsfrom his works, in many parts of the European Alps, mixed with other substances, thereby constituting granitells and porphyries. In the environs of Geneva it forms a binary combination with schoerl. With schoerl and garnet it forms a triple assemblage, so beautiful as to draw forth from De Saussure no inconsider-able encomiums. "Thenext species," he continues, "is a very fine rock, which has never hitherto been described by any one; it is a mixture of jade, green schoerl, and garnet. This stone, ofconsiderable hardness and density, takes a very fine polish, and its great red, green, and yellow spots, then produce the finest effect that can possibly be conceived." </p>
    <p> Another variety of this is enumerated, consisting it would appear, of jade, schoerl, and<pb n="52"/>mica. But it is with that beautiful mineral the smaragdite, according to the intelligent author just cited, that the jade forms a compound of the most exquisite workmanshipof the Great Creator of the Universe. "We found," says he, soon after his arrival in Italy, "in the ravines at the foot of the mountain of Musinet, blocks of jade, notrounded, but which seemed to be detached fragments from this same mountain. As these jades are very fine of their kind, I shall stop for a few moments to de-scribe them.This jade is never found pure but in a mixed rock, of which it forms the ground. It has all the characters I have de-scribed in the first volume of these Travels; butone finds it at the foot of Musinet present-ing different appearances. Here it is of a dull opaque white: there white, but of various de-grees of transparency at its sides, elsewhere of a colour bordering on the lilac, and its sides also varying in transparency; its fracture com-monly a little brilliant and shining, like that ofcalcedony, but in a less degree. This same fracture is something smooth and level, but more frequently uneven, scaly, sometimes the scales very thin, sometimes very large.But its two essential characters are, 1st, its hard-ness; the file may rather be said to break than fill off its angles, its marks remaining on the<pb n="53"/>stone afterwards like lead: and secondly the singular tenacity and cohesion of its parts, which cause it to resist the hammer more than any other known fossil. What ismost remarkable of this stone is, that the blow-pipe fuses it very easily, notwithstanding its extreme hardness. </p>
    <p> "The smaragditeis found inclosed in these jades, and presents itself to the eye under va-rious aspects. Here they are of a very fine transparent green at their sides,of a fine and scaly fracture, and without any marks of crys-tallization: there still green, but in brilliant striated lamin&#xE6; of a rhomboidal shape; else-where grey,their surface very brilliant, striated, and of the same form with the preceding. Their hardness varies; the grey are very tender; those that are crystallized and of a fine green, are the hardest, and even sometimes strike fire with steel; the uncrystallized are not so hard." <ptr target="n4"/> </p>
    <note id="n4"> Those who are desirous of purchasing this beautiful mineral, the product of other climes, at least as far as our mineralogical knowledge of this island at present extends, may be supplied withit at Mr Mawe's Derbyshire Ware-house, Tavistock-street. That I saw there came from Ca-rinthia. </note>
    <pb n="54"/>
    <p> I subjoin to this account of De Saussure's on jade, an extract from Professor Forster's Ob-servations made in a voyage round the world. "Amongst the productions ofthe southern Isle of New Zealand, we must likewise reckon a green stone which sometimes is opaque, and sometimes, quite transparent, manufactured by the natives intohatchets, chissels, and orna-ments, that seems to be of the nephritic kind (talcum nephriticum, Linn.) This stone is commonly brought by the natives from the in-teriorparts of Queen Charlotte's Sound, to the south west, in which direction they pointed. This stone is in perpendicular, or somewhat oblique veins, of about two inchesthickness. The nephritic is seldom solid or in large pieces, for the greatest fragmeents we saw never ex-ceeded twelve or fifteen inches in breadth, and about two inchesin thickness." </p>
    <p> There are ample grounds then to believe, from the copious extracts that I have made relative to jade, that it is rarely found homo-geneous and unmixed with othersubstances. If any where on the globe such a circumstances takes place, it must surely be on the Conti-nent of Asia. The Chinese specimen, per-fectly <i> pure, </i> inthe Leverian Museum, will<pb n="55"/>give strangers to the subject some ideas of oriental jade. The broken green hatchet spe-cimen from one of the newly discovered islands there, is intermixed with quartzoseparticles. </p>

      <i> Departure from Keswick to Penrith. </i>
    </p>
    <p> I NOW recommence my journal: </p>
    <p> July 10th. On my return from Buttermere to Keswick, I had passed through Borrowdale too fatigued to taste its innumerable beauties, I therefore determined to viewit more minute-ly. In my way to it, near Lodore, I picked up a bit of quartz, the greater part of it crys-tallized on chlorite, the particles of chlorite had in some places completely filled the crystals, so that it might have been denominated by any German mineralogist prasium. This re-sembled a specimen I had before seen in Hut-ton's Museum. Between Rosthwaite and Seath-waite I had in my hands a piece of Trap, where was a broken garnet; I searched in vain for more of these pretty gems, therewas Trap enough, but no more garnets. Almost the whole of Borrowdale is without cultivation. The scenes this vale presents are of the most<pb n="57"/>singular nature, and have been too often described by travellers, for me to give any repe-tition of such descriptions; suffice it to say, that wood, water, and rock,all the requisites for the landscape painter, are here present. It is difficult to say, whether the grand or the beautiful reigns most here; I think each in its turnsuccessively triumphs. Situated amoungs the secondary mountains of schist, t is natu-ral to suppose that those who have been accus-tomed only to view the quiet peacefulvalleys of Somerset and Derbyshire, would think, per-haps, the stupendous and magnificent most to predominate; whilst those who had viewed the enormous glens of theAlps, Pyrenees, or Cas-pathian mountains, all primordral and un-touched by the deluge, might be tempted to consider the beautiful as the most prevailing characteristic.I returned that evening to Keswick. </p>
    <p> July 12th. I could not quit this part of the country without mounting Skiddaw. No mountain presents less variety to the naturalist than this. The very summit presentsnothing but schistus and quartz, no rock from whence these stones might have been hurled at any former period is apparent, and it must surely be the prospect at the verytop that induces<pb n="58"/>strangers to come there from all parts of the British empire. One of the springs, when I climbed this mountain, was dried up, and I was obliged to go a mile out of the wayway in search of another, before I was able to assuage my thirst. The tops of mountains, it were al-most unnecessary to repeat, are usually full of springs; this is notthe case with Skiddaw. There is no water to be had at the summit. "The summit of Skiddaw is covered with a whiteish shivery slate, which threatens to slide down withevery gust of wind. The broken state of this slate makes the present summits appears the ruins of others. A circum-stance as extraordinary in appearance as dif-ficultto be accounted for." it is impossible for a better description of Skiddaw to be given than this; but who can be astonished when is from the pen of the wonderful Mrs. Rad-cliff. </p>
    <p>The lake of Derwent Water has no char in it; only perch, or bass as it is here called, eels, pike, and trout, and the salmon which pass through the lakes of Derwent andBassenth-waite, from the river Cocker to spawn the winter season. In the month of May, the sal-mon smelts, or fry as they are called, are on<pb n="59"/>their way to the ocean, they may then be very easily caught. They are esteemed a great de-licacy. Salmon of various sizes are very much prayed on by the otter; that animalhas be-come scarcer of late, owing to the value of its skin, which fetches fourteen shilings; it is used for the making of hats. Often have these otters been known to maketheir depredations on salmon of forty pounds weight; and after eating a very small part off under the neck, leave the rest of the fish untouched. </p>
    <p> The foul, and sweet marts, (as is the provin-cial expression for the martin) are very common here, and are valuable on account of their skins. The first sells foreight-pence in the market, and the latter for four shillings and six-pence. A bird very much famed amongst epicures the dottorel is to be seen occasionally on Skiddawand the adjacent country; they are only there two months in the year, July and August, when they come into these parts merely to breed. The rest of the year they spendin Lin-colnshire and other flat countries. Two fo the species of charadrius, the morinellus, and the hiaticula, my guide informed me, congregate together, as if they belonged to the same species. The accurate Bewick, whose untimely<pb n="60"/>death can never be sufficiently regretted, gives a very different account of these birds. I saw no doterds at the time I was on Skiddaw, but my guide told me the weekbefore he saw twenty brace there at a time together. The bird itself when stripped of its plumage, sells only for four-pence; but its feathers at Kes-wick are alwaysworth sixpence, for the pur-pose of making artificial flies, for the numerous fishermen who live in this neighbourhood. Partridges are scarce, pheasants still more so;woodcocks, snipes, and hares, in very great plenty. The grouse, from what I heard, are more numerous in the neighbourhood of Ap-pleby, than in any other part of Cumberland,of Westmoreland. I do not know the price of house rent in Keswick; they ask a guinea a week, and even more, for private lodgings. At Ambleside the charge for these wasonly twelve shillings per week. The plover is not uncommon in these countries, and the lapwing is likewise their visitant. Provisions on the whole, at Keswick, are veryreasonable. The price I paid for my dinner never exceeded two shillings, and I had always fish out of the Lake, butchers' meat, poultry, wild-foul, tarts, &amp;c. whateverin short I chose included. </p>
    <pb n="61"/>
    <p> Keswick is supplied with bot hits coal and lime from four miles beyond Cockermouth. This town has some but no very considerable trade. </p>
    <p> July 14th. I now prepared to take my de-parture from Keswick, which I had made my headquarters for nearly three weeks, for Penrith. The country through which I passedwas wild, and I was in sight of mountains almost the whole of the way. The last six or seven miles the country is entirely flat, and the mountains are quite in the background as you approach Penrith. The soil becomes no longer schistose; it is wholly of a kind of red free stone. Upon the whole, this drive from Keswick to Penrith, may be considered as the most tame and uninterest-ing of any within the whole circuit of the Lakes. </p>
    <p> July 15th. From Penrith I took the Shap road, by the side of Emont bridge was grow-ing <i> Malva moschata, </i> in size almost a shrub. From hence I went on to Lowther,where is the famous carpet manufactory. Still proceeding on the Shap road, I came to a little village seven miles from Penrith. The country was still flat, but Cross Fellwas viewed at a dis-<pb n="62"/>tance to the left, and to the right the Cumberland mountains were still fine objects in the landscape. On the road from Lowther hither, I picked up some quartz, and a very sparkling sand stone. From this village I with the ut-most difficulty found my way to Holton, where I dined on butter, cheese, barley, and oat cake. I thought the repast very clean and good. I returned to Penrith first through shady lanes, and then over a wide extended common. The country the whole of this days' journey flat andnot interesting. </p>

      <i> Cursory Observations on Granite; to which subjoined, a Remark or two on Lakes. </i>
    </p>
    <p> BEFORE I proceed farther in my journal, I find it absolutely necessary to say a few words on the subject of granite, the reason for which will, I hope, appear towardsthe conclusion of this work. Those who live in the south of England, have no idea of this substance; it forms no part of its soil; the streets of Lon-don are indeed manyof them paved with it, but these stones come from other parts of the island, and of the world, chiefly I believe from Aberdeenshire. It would appear that for the mostpart, the highest and the most elevated sposts on the earth are of this material. Mount Blanc, the great majestic sovereign of the Alps, is composed of it; it consists of three distinct substances. It was considered not very long since, as the product of fire, but this opinion seems very gradually to have lost ground. The celebratedProfessor Pallas, who has given an <pb n="64"/>eloquent and vivid description of it, does not however take upon himself to combat the idea formerly entertained of it by Buffon, and other naturalists, viz. that it hasbeen formerly in a state of fusion. He rather seems to coincide with them, "It may fairly be admitted as an axiom," says he, "that the highest moun-tains of the globe,which form continued chains, such as the Swedish, Swiss, and Tyro-lian Alps, the mountains tha environ Bohe-mia <ptr target="n5"/>, those of Siberia, Caucasus, and eventhe Andes themselves are of this rock, that has been denominated granite, whose base is always a quartz, more or less mixed with feltspath, mica, and little basaltes(scheorl), <ptr target="n6"/> scattered here and there without order, and in irregular fragments of different proportions. This au-cient rock, and the sand produced byits de-composition form the basis of all our conti-nents. It is granite one meets with below the deepest strata of mountains; it is granite that <pb n="65"/>forms the great platform, or the heart as it were, of the highest Alps of the known universe, so that nothing can be more natural than to consi-der this rock as the principalingredient of the interior of our globe. Granite," he adds, "seems to have been in a state of fusion, and to have been the product of fire. But it is not, perhaps, forman," continues he, with an humility highly be-coming his character, "to investigate the real cause that has thrown this enormous mass of vetrified matter in the orbitwhere we are cir-culating; and the ingenous Author of Re-cherches sur les Americains, seems to be in the right when he says, that it would be just as ridiculous to write a treatise on the formation of stars as on that of these rocks, which have been erected by the puissant hands of all-crea-tive nature, to which we owe the little planeton which our philosophers pretend to reason."-[Observations sur le Montagnes.] </p>
    <note id="n5"> The Riesen Geburge, I suppose he alludes to. </note>
    <note id="n6"> The name of granite is now refused to any ingredients but quartz, fellspath, and mica. Those even with schoerl in them are now titled granitells. </note>
    <p>M. de Luc agrees with those who assert, that no traces of the action of fire are to be me with in granite; but he confesses at the same time, that these mountains appearto him <i> inexplicable, </i> and that no marks of their for-mation are to be discerned. "It is granite," says this learned philosopher, "that consti- <pb n="66"/>tutes the great mass of mountains decidedly primordial: whenever it is found it bears the marks of its high antiquity. It is to be seen every where in fragments. Inmountains it forms the heart of the Alps, and other greater and lesser chains; but it is found in an hun-dred places only in the form of simple emi-nences, but no whereis it ever seen to depart from its truly generic character, viz. that of exhibiting no marks of its first formation." </p>
    <p> M. Rom&#xE9; de Lille thus expresses himself on the subject. "It is impossible to guess at the formation of primitive mountains, unless one considers them as the productof an almost simultaneous crystallization of the different stony substances composing them." In this opinion M. de Saussure concurs, and perhaps it is the most likelyto be true, as this hardy and enterprizing natualist attentively inspected those rocks, on the very spots where they rear their tremendous heads. </p>
    <p> Whatever then be the origins of its formation, let us see how the great beneficent Author of the Universe has scattered this substance, granite, in our own island.We have already seen, from Porfessor Pallas's account, how large a<pb n="67"/>part of the known world this substance occu-pies. How much of Great Britain does it occupy? The whole almost of Scotland and its adjacent isles is of granite; so is Cornwalland a great part of the west of Devon. Of Wales we know at present too little to speak with great decision concerning it. I imagine it is to be found in the south, andwest of Radnor-shire. It seems to occupy more or less small districts in most of the counties of North Wales, and here and there in Shorpshire. I have no reason for supposing it extends from Scotland farther than the four most northern English counties; I am inclined to think that neither the gigantic hills of Ingleborough, Penygent,Pendle-hill, or Whernside, are of this substance; but of this I cannot speak with confidence. I think I can speak with greater confidence of the Derbyshire and Staf-fordshire hills, whci though they are plainly a continuation of the Scotch mountains, yet contain no granite. Granite then may be said to take its rise from three distinct parts of Great Britain, Scotland, Carnavrvonshire, and Dartmoor in Devon; but these granitic tracts never unite with each other, but are thoroughly separate and distinct chains.Immense plains,<pb n="68"/>as well as mountains of another description, besides the Bristol Channel, divid the Devonshire granite, for instance from that of North Wales; and the Shropshire hills which are a continuation of the latter, form no sort of union with the Staffordshire range, as might at first be supposed, but are intersected from each other by a tolerably large tract of flat country. What however is most worthy of remark is, that the northern provinces of France, opposite to us, notwithstanding the interventionof the British Channel, completely answer to our English counties in respect to soil; the shores of each country corresponding nearly with their opposite strata. Thewhole almost of Britanny is granite, so is Cornwall. In Nor-mandy, as in Dorsetshire, the chalky soil be-gins and continues to extend itself through Picardy towards Artoisand Flanders, as the latter does into Kent. Nay, more, this analogy becomes more perfect as the oceans widens. The Flemish and Dutch shores are low, flat, and morassy;so are the eastern ones of England. </p>
    <p> What, is curious, however, as you enter the Baltic (I know not what is the soil of Jutland, and therefore cannot compare it with the con- <pb n="69"/>tiguous coast of Norway) this doctrine seems to be reversed, the shores of Sweden and Fin-land being totally different from those of the southern side of that sea. The shores of the two former are granitic; those of Mecklen-burg, Brandenburgh, and Poland, low and sandy. It is impossible to quit this subject without saying a word or twoon lakes. Lakes are generally to be found either in very moun-tainous, or very flat countries. The moun-tainous sort are to be seen in Sweden, Swisser-land, the northernpart of Italy, Scotland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, Carnarvonshire, Merionethshire, &amp;c. The lakes I am now speaking of, exist almost all of them in the neighbourhoodof granite. The second sort are to be seen in soils entirely alluvial, viz. in the Dutch provinces of Friseland and Overyssel, Mecklenburgh, Lithuania, &amp;c. and in our own contry there are Whittlesea, Ramsey, and Ugg Meres, with many other of these waters in Huntingdon, Cambridge, and Lincolnshire. The fish, it may be observed, thatsubsist in Alpine lakes, are some of them very different from those which live in the lakes I have just mentioned. No on, for instance, I should think, ever saw the char,the gwyniad, or the<pb n="70"/>grayling; in the lakes of flat countries, or the burbot, the stickleback, or bream, I should suppose, in the Alpine; though pike, peach, eels, and even trout, it must beconfessed, are common to both. I believe I am making a true assertion when I say that the aquatic plants growing in each of these sorts of lakes, are also very different.The <i> Isoctes lacustris </i> and <i> Lobelia Dortmanna, </i> I never heard of in the lakes of flat countries, nor amongst the mountains have i ever seen the beautiful<i> Stratiotes alodes, </i> or <i> Hydrocharis morsus ran&#xE6;. </i> The elegant <i> nymph&#xE6;&#xE6; </i> are indeed to be seen in both. But what particularly showstheir distinct nature, is the surrounding atmosphere of each. No <i> pestilential miasmata </i> proceed from the Alpine lakes, whereas from those of a different description,the noxious effects resulting from them are too well and fatally known for me to expatiate on for an instant. These last are likewise more the resort of the Amphibia thanthe Alpine ones. In Lithuania, where these sorts of lakes are to the full as abundant as any part of Europe, the serpents have been de-scribed to be the scourge of theinhabitants of that province. The little town of Sluck is surrounded by lakes infested with serpents of an<pb n="71"/> astonishing size, that very frequently attack foot passengers. <ptr target="n7"/> Though snakes exist near Alpine lakes, they are not more general therethan elsewhere, ather, perhaps, in smaller quantities. </p>

      <i> Excursion to UllsWater, Ambleside, and Kendal, and from thence return to Penrith. </i>
    </p>
    <p> I NOW resume my narrative: </p>
    <p> July 16th. Go to Ulls Water, stop at Pooley-bridge, at the foot of the lake; in my way saw for the first time in this country, a bit of granite, or more strictly speaking gra-nitel, since schoerl was one of the ingredients. Immense masses too of the compound tuber-culated stone I had seen at Wyburn, were every where conspicuous,as well as lime-stones, traps, &amp;c. what dissimilar minerals crowded toge-ther in one spot! As you proceed to coast the lake, more of the granitel just mentioned oc-curs. The journey from Patterdale to Amble-side is one of the sublimest as well as most beautiful, throughout the whole district of the lakes. He must be fastidiousindeed whom this route will not charm. It was with the most rapturous delight I saw these spots seven-teen years before, nor had time in the least ef-<pb n="73"/>faced those impressions which this lovely and much varied country first inspired me with. As you descend from a very steep fell, and first come within sight of Esthwaiteand Winander-mere, language is too poor to give any idea of the marvellous contrast exhibited between the sterile and bleak, and the enchanting and tranquil landscape.The northern part of Ulls Water, notwithstanding it has its admirers, is I think, little worthy of fixing the attention of tourists. It is the southern part, within fouror five miles of Patterdale, where this lake dis-covers its manifold and exquisite beauties. I am glad to have this opinion confirmed by Mr. Green, and artist of someeminence, who entirely agreed with me on this point. I ar-rived in the evening at Lowood Inn, where as a fortnight before I was very comfortably ac-commodated. </p>
    <p> July 17. Made a vain attempt to ascend Hard Knot, but the weather was too sultry to suffer me to proceed far. I was surprized at the quantity of quakers I met on the road. Methodism seems the predominant sect in Wales, and quaakerism the most prevalent in this country. Wherever these last fix their domicils, the inhabitants have noreason to re-<pb n="74"/>pine. They usually bring in their train no revenge, no envy, no cruelty, none in short of the worst passions. </p>
    <p> July 18th. The weather was still so sultry that I judged it most advisable to remain the hwole of the day at Lowood. Luckily I ob-tained a sight of Mr. Housman's mostexcellent maps of the northern counties which are in the highest degree useful to every species of traveller, but to none more that the naturalist, as the flat and mountainous districts, as well as the singular bifurcation of these British Apen-nines is there exactly delineated. </p>
    <p> July 19th. The weather still continued im-moderately sultry, nevertheless, I was deter-mined to proceed to Kendal, twelve miles; stopped at Stavely, where I procuredsome excellent cider, a rather rare beverage in this part of England. I have a very few short remarks to make on the country I passed through this morning on my way toKendal. </p>
    <p> "The line of seperation," says M. Fauias de St. Fond, "between the lime stone and the granite, is always distinguished by a sort of intermediate zone, which merits allthe attention of naturalists. </p>
    <pb n="75"/>
    <p> I have always found pebbles, rounded flints, breccias, pudding stones, gravel and quartzose grit, frequently mixed with spangles of mica, in this intermediate girdle,which seems to separate the calcareous hills from the chains of granite." </p>
    <p> How true is this assertion, and how well exemplified in this island in the eastern part of Devon, fertile in amygdaloids, and lying be-tween the lime-stone strata ofSomerset and Dorset, and granitic Dart Moor! 2dly, in beautiful Malvern Wells, lying between the Gloucestershire lime-stone ridge and the Welch mountains, presenting tothe eye green oxides or iron, and variolites of uncommon lustre and elegance! But it is not this sort of transition I am about to speak, it is a transition less interesting;but not to be passed over in silence. </p>
    <p> It is the passage from the schistose to the calcareous strata: these exhibit not the va-riaties of those last spoken of, but they are usually the seat of the mostbeautiful marbles, and I have every reason to believe, though I cannot take upon me decidedly to affirm it, that the rock from whence alum is extracted, is generallythat which arises from a junction, <pb n="76"/>or rather admixture and incorporation of cal-careous and schistose particles. I am con-firmed still more in this idea, from the passage I have just been reading extractedfrom the Journal de Physique. June 1778, p. 104. </p>
    <p> "It appears from the experiments of M. Bayen, that the green marble of Campan is a mixed stone, a compound of calcareous earth and schistus; but the calcareous particlesare the predominant ones; that in all these sort of stones he had examined, there was a great quantity of <i> aluminous </i> earth and iron. To the presence of the lattersubstance he ascribed the green colour of marble. It was then soil, of the nature just described, that I passed over in my way to Kendal, at which place is a mar-ble,which has been described to me to be a calcareous breccia, cemented with red and yel-low oxides or iron, and occupying a perpendi-cular chasm a little below the town. </p>
    <p> I paid, whilst at Kendal, two visits to Mr. Todhunter's museum. It contains independ-ent of minerals, shells, lichens, and a few water birds. The collection of granitesand porphyries is not very numerous. Amongst the granites the most curious are those that <pb n="77"/>were found in digging the Lancaster canal. Pebbles of jade; these he had collected himself from St. Bees; they were rounded as those I had seen at Hutton's containingmany of them white and red feltspar. These, as has been be-fore observed, may be considered by some as porphyries, by others as granitels. I was sor-ry  had not time to visit the gunpowder works at Sedgwick, and I should liked to have seen the little port of Millthorpe, but circum-stances of a very imperious nature demanded my presence in the south. I accordingly set out next day, July 20th, for Penrith; passed again through Shap, the country about which is plainly the connecting link betweenthe Yorkshire and Cumberland mountains. Ar-rived at Penrith, where, after stopping a few days, I prepared, with unfeigned reluctance and chagrin, to return to the south.</p>

      <i> Departure from Penrith to London. </i>
    </p>
    <p> IT is difficult to conceive the regret I experi-enced on taking my leave of the lakes. I had designed before my return southwards, to have examined the country aboutGilsland, the in-teresting Yorkshire caves, the neighbourhood of Alston Moor, and perhaps a part of the Northumberland border. I might also have made a short excursion into Scotland, where the antimony mines would have particularly attracted my attention. Then this work, with all its imperfections might have been considered as givingto the best of the author's power, a <i> complete </i> account of a certain district. At pre-sent, even this sketch or outline, is faint and feeble indeed, compared with what it might have been, had my residence been only a month longer there. I was moreover singularly fortu-nate in having a description of the coutry about Shap, sent meby a very able and accurate<pb n="79"/>pen, a line of country uncommonly interesting to the lithologist. I had purposed to have ex-plored it with the utmost care and circumspec-tion; my blow-pipe I was in dailyexpectation of, and every thing seemed to promise me an abundant harvest of delight and instruction. From a visit to the mountains around Hawes Water, and in Martindale Forest, I had pro-mised myself great pleasure. But regrets are futile and useless. Perhaps at some future pe-riod it may be my fate to revisit this happy country, thoughwith greater ardour and en-thusiasm that I did this summer is impossible. From Penrith I took a place in one of the Lon-don coaches. To get into Yorkshire, you pass avery narrow slip, between Appleby and Brough, of the British Apennines. This seems to be almost the narrowest part of the whole chain, not far from the place where theseApennines (as appears from Housman's map) bifurcate. When you have got over this pass, and have proceeded a few miles into Yorkshire, the face of the country changes, itis no longer mountainous, but swells into gentle eminences, the soil is of lime-stone, and this kind of soil is more or less observable, till you arrive in Lincolnshire,where the chalk-stone strata com-mence near Grantham. Surely this cannot be<pb n="80"/>a continuation of the Cambridge and Bedford-shire hills? At any other time than that I was travelling, I might have had occasion to ad-mire the extreme fertility of theparts of Lin-coln and Huntingdonshire, I had been passing through; but these objects for one who panted for a cooler and less scorching atmosphere, had but few charms.London, unfortunately for the naturalist, is not like Geneva, seated in the very centre of different chains of moun-tains. Except the counties of Monmouth and Derby, youhave nearly two hundred miles, in every direction from the metropolis, to travel over, before any county interesting to the geologist appears. </p>
    <p> I arrived in London, after a journey of two days and two nights, very little fatigued, which was owing, I am convinced, to the superiorly exhilirating nature of theair I had of late been accustomed to respire. </p>
