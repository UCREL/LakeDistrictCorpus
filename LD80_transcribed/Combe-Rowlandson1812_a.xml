<p>THE following Poem, if it may be allowed to deserve the name, was written under circumstances, whose peculiarity may be thought to justify a communication of them. - - I undertook to give metrical Illustrations of the Prints with which Mr. ACKERMANN decorated the <i>Poetical Magazine</i>, a Work published by him in <i>Monthly Numbers</i>, for the reception of original compositions. Many of these Engravings were miscellaneous, and those, (which were, indeed, the far greater part of them,) whose description was submitted to such a Muse as mine, represented views of interesting objects, and beautiful Scenery, or were occasional decorations appropriate to the work. The designs to which this volume is so greatly indebted, I was informed would follow in a <i>Series</i>, and it was propos'd to me to shape out a story from them. - - An Etching or a Drawing was accordingly sent to me every

<pb n="ii" />  

month, and I composed a certain proportion of pages in verse, in which, of course, the subject of the design was included : the rest depended upon what my imagination could furnish. When the first print was sent to me, I did not know what would be the subject of the second ; and in this manner, in a great measure, the Artist continued designing, and I continued writing, every month for two years, 'till a Work, containing near ten thousand Lines was produced : the Artist and the Writer having no personal communication with, or knowledge of each other. This vast collection of verses, however, appeared to advance the purpose of the Magazine in which they grew into such an unexpected accumulation. - - Mr. ACKERMANN was satisfied with my Service, and I was satisfied with the remuneration of it. - - I felt no parental fondness for the work though it was written at that very advanced period of Life, when we are apt to attach Importance to any little unexpected exertion of decaying strength. - - It would have been no more thought of by me : - - But Mr. ACKERMANN has his reasons for risquing a republication of it, in its present form ; and I now feel more than common solicitude that it should answer his expectations. My own vanity has a very small share in my wishes for its success ; and in the

<pb n="iii" />

indulgence of them I can truly declare, that I am principally actuated by the part I take in the interests of a man, who, in the course of my concerns with him, has grown in my esteem and regard - - I have, therefore, given my best attention to the correction of the whole ; and have endeavoured to lessen those defects which naturally arose from the irregular and undetermined mode of its composition. - - <i>The Battle</i> of the <i>Books</i> was an after though : and forms the <i>Novelty</i> of this volume.</p>

<line>Liberius si</line>
<line>Dixero quid, si forte jocosius ; hoc mihi juris,</line>
<line>Cum venia dabis. - - HOR, s. Lib. i. Sat. iv.</line>
</poem>

<p>I have only to add - that though on a first view of some of the prints, it may appear as if the Clerical Character was treated with Levity, I am confident in announcing a very opposite Impression from a perusal of the Work.</p>

<stanza>
<line>THE school was done, the bus'ness o'er,</line> 
<line>When, tir'd of Greek and Latin lore,</line> 
<line>Good Syntax sought his easy chair,</line> 
<line>And sat in calm composure there.</line> 
<line>His wife was to a neighbour gone,</line> 
<line>To hear the chit-chat of the town ;</line> 
<line>And left him the unfrequent power</line> 
<line>Of brooding thro' a quiet hour.</line> 
<line>Thus, while he sat, a busy train</line> 
<line>Of images besieged his brain.</line> 
<line>Of church-preferment he had none :</line> 
<line>Nay, all his hope of that was gone.</line> 
<line>He felt that he content must be</line> 
<line>With drudging in a Curacy.</line> 
<line>Indeed, on ev'ry Sabbath day,</line> 
<line>Through eight long miles he took his way,</line> 
<line>To preach, to grumble, and to pray ;</line> 
<line>To cheer the good, to warn the sinner,</line> 
<line>And, if he got it, - - eat a dinner :</line>

<pb n="2" />
 
<line>To bury these, to christen those,</line> 
<line>And marry such fond folks as chose</line> 
<line>To change the tenor of their life,</line> 
<line>And risk the matrimonial strife.</line> 
<line>Thus were his weekly journeys made,</line> 
<line>'Neath summer suns and wintry shade ;</line> 
<line>And all his gains, it did appear,</line> 
<line>Were only thirty pounds a year.</line> 
<line>Besides, th' augmenting taxes press</line> 
<line>To aid expense and add distress :</line> 
<line>Mutton and beef, and bread and beer,</line>
<line>And ev'ry thing was grown so dear ;</line> 
<line>The boys were always prone to eat,</line> 
<line>Delighting less in books than meat ;</line> 
<line>That, when the time of Christmas came,</line> 
<line>His earnings ceas'd to be the same ;</line>
<line>And now, alas, could do no more,</line> 
<line>Than keep the wolf without the door.</line> 
<line>E'en birch, the pedant master's boast,</line> 
<line>Was so increas'd in worth and cost,</line> 
<line>That oft, prudentially beguil'd,</line> 
<line>To save the rod, he spar'd the child.</line> 
<line>Thus, if the times refus'd to mend,</line> 
<line>He to his school must put an end.</line> 
<line>How hard his lot ! how blind his fate !</line> 
<line>What shall he do to mend his state ?</line> 
<line>Thus did poor Syntax ruminate.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>When, as the vivid meteors fly,</line> 
<line>And instant light the gloomy sky,</line> 
<line>A sudden thought across him came,</line> 
<line>And told the way to wealth and fame ;</line> 
<line>And, as th' expanding vision grew</line> 
<line>Wider and wider to his view,</line>

<pb n="3" />

<line>The painted fancy did beguile</line> 
<line>His woe-worn phiz into a smile :</line> 
<line>But, while he pac'd the room around,</line>
<line>Or stood immers'd in thought profound,</line> 
<line>The Doctor, 'midst his rumination,</line>
<line>Was waken'd by a visitation</line> 
<line>Which troubles many a poor man's life - - </line>
<line>The visitation of his wife.</line> 
<line>Good Mrs. Syntax was a lady</line>
<line>Ten years, perhaps, beyond her hey-day ;</line> 
<line>But though the blooming charms had flown,</line> 
<line>That grac'd her youth, it still was known</line> 
<line>The love of power she never lost,</line> 
<line>As Syntax found it to his cost :</line>
<line>For as her words were us'd to flow,</line> 
<line>He but replied or, YES, or NO. - - </line> 
<line>When e'er enrag'd by some disaster,</line> 
<line>She'd shake the boys, and cuff the master ;</line> 
<line>Nay, to avenge the slightest wrong,</line> 
<line>She could employ both arms and tongue ;</line> 
<line>And, if we list to country tales,</line> 
<line>She sometimes would enforce her nails.</line> 
<line>Her face was red, her form was fat,</line> 
<line>A round-about, and rather squat ;</line>
<line>And, when in angry humour stalking,</line> 
<line>Was like a dumpling set a-walking.</line> 
<line>'Twas not the custom of this spouse</line> 
<line>To suffer long a quiet house :</line> 
<line>She was among those busy wives</line>
<line>Who hurry-scurry through their lives ;</line> 
<line>And make amends for fading beauty</line> 
<line>By telling husbands of their duty.</line> 
</stanza>

<pb n="4" />

<stanza>
<line>'Twas at this moment, when, inspir'd,</line>
<line>And by his new ambition fir'd,</line>
<line>The pious man his hands uprear'd,</line> 
<line>That Mrs. Syntax re-appear'd,</line>
<line>Amaz'd she look'd, and loud she shriek'd,</line>
<line>Or, rather like a pig she squeak'd,</line> 
<line>To see her humble husband dare</line> 
<line>Thus quit his sober ev'ning chair,</line> 
<line>And pace, with varying steps, about,</line> 
<line>Now in the room, and now without.</line> 
<line>At first, she did not find her tongue,</line> 
<line>(A thing which seldom happen'd long,)</line> 
<line>But soon that organ grew unquiet,</line> 
<line>To ask the cause of all this riot.</line> 
<line>The Doctor smil'd, and thus address'd</line> 
<line>The secrets of his lab'ring breast - -</line>
<line>" Sit down, by love, my dearest dear,</line> 
<line>Nay, prithee do, and patient hear ;</line> 
<line>Let me, for once, throughout my life,</line> 
<line>Receive this kindness from my wife ;</line> 
<line>It will oblige me so : - - in troth,</line> 
<line>It will, my dear, oblige us both ;</line> 
<line>For such a plan has come athwart me,</line> 
<line>Which some kind sprite from Heav'n has brought me ;</line> 
<line>That, if you will your councils join,</line> 
<line>To aid this golden scheme of mine,</line> 
<line>New days will come - - new times appear,</line> 
<line>And teeming plenty crown the year :</line> 
<line>We then on dainty bits shall dine,</line> 
<line>And change our home-brew'd ale for wine :</line> 
<line>On summer days, to take the air,</line> 
<line>We'll put our Grizzle to a chair ;</line> 
<line>While you, in silks and muslins fine,</line> 
<line>The grocer's wife shall far outshine.</line> 

<pb n="5" />

<line>And neighb'ring folks be forc'd to own,</line> 
<line>In this fair town you give the ton."</line> 
<line>" Oh ! tell me," cried the smiling dame,</line> 
<line>" Tell me this golden road to fame :</line> 
<line>You charm my heart, you quite delight it." - -</line> 
<line>" - - <i>I'll make a</i> TOUR - - <i>and then I'll</i> WRITE IT.</line> 
<line>You well know what my pen can do,</line> 
<line>And I'll employ my pencil too : - -</line> 
<line>I'll ride and <i>write</i>, and <i>sketch</i> and <i>print</i>,</line> 
<line>And thus create a real mint ;</line> 
<line>I'll <i>prose</i> it here, I'll <i>verse</i> it there,</line> 
<line>And <i>picturesque</i> it ev'ry where :</line> 
<line>I'll do what all have done before ;</line> 
<line>I think I shall - - and some what more.</line> 
<line>At Doctor <i>Pompous</i> give a look ;</line> 
<line>He made his fortune by a book :</line> 
<line>And if my volume dose not beat it,</line> 
<line>When I return I'll fry and eat it.</line> 
<line>Next week the boys will all go home.</line> 
<line>And I shall have a month to come.</line> 
<line>My clothes, my cash, my all prepare ;</line> 
<line>Let <i>Ralph</i> looks to the grizzle mare :</line> 
<line>Tho' wond'ring folks may laugh or scoff,</line> 
<line>By this day fortnight I'll be off ;</line> 
<line>And when old Time a month has run,</line> 
<line>Our bus'ness, <i>Lovey</i>, will be done.</line> 
<line>I will in search of fortune roam,</line> 
<line>While you enjoy yourself at home."</line>

<line>The story told, the Doctor eas'd</line> 
<line>Of his grand plan, and Madam pleas'd,</line> 
<line>No pains were spar'd by night or day</line> 
<line>To set him forward on his way :</line> 

<pb n="6" />

<line>She trimm'd his coat - - she mended all</line> 
<line>His various clothing, great and small ;</line> 
<line>And better still, a purse was found</line> 
<line>With twenty notes, of each a poimd.</line> 
<line>Thus furnish'd, and in full condition</line> 
<line>To prosper in his expedition,</line> 
<line>At length the ling'ring moment came</line>
<line>That gave the dawn of wealth and fame.</line> 
<line>Incurious <i>Ralph</i>, exact at four,</line> 
<line>Led Grizzle, saddled, to the door ;</line> 
<line>And soon, with more than common state,</line> 
<line>The Doctor stood before the gate.</line> 
<line>Behind him was his faithful wife ; - -</line> 
<line>" One more embrace, my dearest life !"</line> 
<line>Then his grey palfrey he bestrode,</line> 
<line>And gave a nod, and off he rode.</line> 
<line>" Good luck ! good luck !" she loudly cried ;</line>

<line>THE farewell ceremony o'er,</line> 
<line>Madam went in and bang'd the door :</line> 
<line>No woeful tear bedew'd her eye,</line> 
<line>Nor did she heave a single sigh ;</line> 
<line>But soon began her daily trade,</line> 
<line>To chide the man and scold the maid ;</line> 
<line>While Syntax, with his scheme besotted,</line> 
<line>Along the village gently trotted.</line> 
<line>The folks, on daily labour bent,</line> 
<line>Whistled and carrol'd as they went ;</line> 
<line>But, as the Doctor pass'd along,</line> 
<line>Bow'd down their heads, and ceas'd their song :</line> 
<line>He gravely nodded to the people ;</line> 
<line>Then looking upwards to the steeple,</line> 
<line>He thus, in mutt'ring tones, express'd</line> 
<line>The disappointments of his breast : - -</line> 
<line>" That thankless parent, Mother Church,</line> 
<line>Has ever left me in the lurch ;</line> 
<line>And, while so many fools are seen</line> 
<line>To strut a Rector or a Dean,</line> 
<line>Who live in ease and find good cheer</line> 
<line>On ev'ry day of ev'ry year,</line> 
<line>So small her share of true discerning,</line> 
<line>She turn'd her back on all my learning.</line> 
<line>I've in her vineyard labour'd hard,</line> 
<line>And what has been my lean reward ?</line>

<pb n="8" />
 
<line>I've dug the ground, while some rich Vicar</line> 
<line>Press'd the ripe grape, and drank the liquor ;</line> 
<line>I fed the flock, while others eat</line> 
<line>The mutton's nice, delicious meat ;</line> 
<line>I've kept the hive, and made the honey,</line>
<line>While the drones pocketed the money.</line> 
<line>But now, on better things intent,</line> 
<line>On far more grateful labours bent,</line>
<line>New prospects open to my view ;</line> 
<line>So, thankless Mother Church, adieu ! "</line> 
<line>Thus, having said his angry say,</line>
<line>Syntax proceeded on his way.</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>The morning lark ascends on high,</line>
<line>And with its music greets the sky :</line>
<line>The blackbird whistles, and the thrush</line> 
<line>Warbles his wild notes in the bush ;</line> 
<line>While ev'ry hedge and ev'ry tree</line> 
<line>Resound with vocal minstrelsy :</line>
<line>But Syntax, wrapt in thought profound,</line> 
<line>Is deaf to each enliv'ning sound :</line>
<line>Revolving many a golden scheme,</line> 
<line>And yielding to the pleasing dream,</line> 
<line>The reins hung loosely from his hand ;</line> 
<line>While Grizzle, senseless of command,</line> 
<line>Unguided, pac'd the road along,</line> 
<line>Nor knew if it were right or wrong.</line> 
<line>Through the deep vale, and up the hill,</line>
<line>By rapid stream and tinkling rill,</line>
<line>Grizzle her thoughtful master bore,</line>
<line>Who, counting future treasure o'er,</line>
<line>And, on his weighty projects bent,</line> 
<line>Observ'd not whither Grizzle went.</line> 

<pb n="9" />

<line>Thus did Fancy's soothing power</line> 
<line>Cheat him of many a fleeting hour ;</line> 
<line>Nor did he know the pacing Sun</line> 
<line>Had half his daily circuit run.</line> 
<line>Sweet, airy sprite, that can bestow</line> 
<line>A pleasing respite to our woe,</line> 
<line>That can corroding care beguile,</line> 
<line>And make the woe-worn face to smile !</line> 
<line>But, ah ! too soon the vision passes,</line> 
<line>Confounded by a pack of asses !</line> 
<line>The donkies bray'd ; and lo ! the sound</line> 
<line>Awak'd him from his thought profound ;</line> 
<line>And as he star'd, and look'd around,</line> 
<line>He said - - or else he seem'd to say - -</line>
<line>" I find that I have lost my way.</line> 
<line>Oh what a wide expanse I see,</line> 
<line>Without a wood, without a tree ;</line> 
<line>No one's at hand, no house is near,</line>
<line>To tell the way, or give good cheer ;</line> 
<line>For now a sign would be a treat,</line> 
<line>To tell us we might drink and eat :</line> 
<line>But sure there is not in my sight</line> 
<line>The sign of any living wight ;</line> 
<line>And all around upon this common</line> 
<line>I see not either man or woman ;</line> 
<line>Nor dogs to bark, nor cocks to crow,</line> 
<line>Nor sheep to bleat, nor herds to low ;</line>
<line>And if these asses did not bray,</line> 
<line>And thus some signs of life betray,</line> 
<line>I well might think that I were hurl'd</line> 
<line>Into some sad, unpeopled world.</line>
<line>How could I come, misguided wretch !</line> 
<line>To where I cannot make a sketch ?"</line> 
</stanza>

<pb n="10" />

<line>Thus, as he ponder'd what to do,</line> 
<line>A guide-post 'rose within his view ;</line> 
<line>And, when the pleasing shape he spied,</line> 
<line>He prick'd his steed, and thither hied ;</line> 
<line>But some unheeding, senseless wight,</line> 
<line>Who to fair learning ow'd a spite,</line> 
<line>Had ev'ry letter'd mark defac'd,</line> 
<line>Which once its several pointers grac'd.</line> 
<line>The mangled post thus long had stood,</line> 
<line>An uninforming piece of wood ;</line> 
<line>Like other guides, as some folks say,</line>
<line>Who neither lead, nor point the way.</line> 
<line>The Sun, as hot as he was bright,</line> 
<line>Had got to his meridian height ;</line> 
<line>'Twas sultry noon - - for not a breath</line> 
<line>Of cooling zephyr fann'd the heath - -</line> 
<line>When Syntax cried - - " 'Tis all in vain</line> 
<line>To find my way across the plain ;</line> 
<line>So here my fortune I will try,</line>
<line>And wait till some one passes by :</line>
<line>Upon that bank awhile I'll sit,</line> 
<line>And let poor Grizzle graze a bit ;</line> 
<line>But, as my time shall not be lost,</line> 
<line>I'll make a drawing of the post ;</line> 
<line>And, tho' your flimsy taste may flout it,</line>
<line>There's something <i>picturesque</i> about it :</line> 
<line>'Tis rude and rough, without a gloss,</line> 
<line>And is well cover'd o'er with moss ;</line> 
<line>And I've a right - - (who dares deny it?)</line> 
<line>To place yon group of asses by it.</line> 
<line>Ay ! this will do : and now I'm thinking,</line>
<line>That self-same pond where Grizzle's drinking,</line> 
<line>If hither brought 'twould better seem,</line> 
<line>And faith I'll turn it to a stream :</line> 

<pb n="11" />

<line>I'll make this flat a shaggy ridge,</line>
<line>And o'er the water throw a bridge :</line> 
<line>I'll do as other sketchers do - -</line> 
<line>Put any thing into the view ;</line> 
<line>And any object recollect,</line> 
<line>To add a grace, and give effect.</line> 
<line>Thus, tho' from truth I haply err,</line> 
<line><i>The scene preserves its character.</i></line> 
<line>What man of taste my right will doubt,</line>
<line>To put things in, or leave them out ?</line> 
<line>'Tis more than right, it is a duty,</line> 
<line>If we consider landscape beauty : - -</line> 
<line>He ne'er will as an artist shine,</line> 
<line>Who copies Nature line by line :</line> 
<line>Whoe'er from Nature takes a view,</line> 
<line>Must copy and improve it too.</line> 
<line>To heighten ev'ry work of art,</line> 
<line>Fancy should take an active part :</line> 
<line>Thus I (which few I think can boast)</line> 
<line><i>Have made a Landscape of a Post.</i></line>
</stanza> 

<stanza> 
<line>" So far, so good - - but no one passes,</line> 
<line>No living creature but these asses ;</line> 
<line>And, should I sit and hear them bray,</line> 
<line>I were as great a beast as they :</line> 
<line>So I'll be off ; - - from yonder down</line> 
<line>I may, perhaps, descry a town ;</line> 
<line>Or some tall spire, among the trees,</line> 
<line>May give my way-worn spirits ease."</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Grizzle again he soon bestrode,</line>
<line>And wav'd his whip, and off he rode :</line> 
<line>But all around was dingy green,</line> 
<line>No spire arose, no town was seen.</line>

<pb n="12" />
 
<line>At length he reach'd a beaten road :</line> 
<line>How great a joy the sight bestow'd !</line> 
<line>So on he went, in pleasant mood,</line> 
<line>And shortly gain'd a stately wood,</line>
<line>Where the refreshing zephyrs play'd</line>
<line>And cool'd the air beneath the shade.</line> 
<line>Oh ! what a change, how great the treat,</line> 
<line>To fanning breeze from sultry heat !</line> 
<line>But, ah ! how false is human joy !</line> 
<line>When least we think it, ills annoy :</line> 
<line>For now, with fierce impetuous rush,</line> 
<line>Three ruffians issued from a bush ;</line> 
<line>One Grizzle stopp'd, and seiz'd the reins,</line> 
<line>While they all threat the Doctor's brains.</line> 
<line>Poor Syntax, trembling with affright,</line> 
<line>Resists not such superior might,</line>
<line>But yields him to their savage pleasure,</line>
<line>And gives his purse, with all its treasure.</line> 
<line>Fearing, however, the Doctor's view</line> 
<line>Might be to follow and pursue ;</line> 
<line>The cunning robbers wisely counted</line> 
<line>That he, of course, should be dismounted ;</line> 
<line>And still that it would safer be,</line> 
<line>If he were fastened to a tree.</line> 
<line>Thus to a tree they quickly bound him - -</line> 
<line>The cruel cords went round and round him ;</line> 
<line>And, having of all pow'r bereft him,</line> 
<line>They tied him fast - - and then they left him.</line>

<line>BY the road side, within the wood,</line> 
<line>In this sad state poor Syntax stood ;</line> 
<line>His bosom heav'd with many a sigh,</line> 
<line>And the tears stood in either eye.</line> 
<line>What could he do ? - - he durst not bawl ;</line> 
<line>The noise the robbers might recall ;</line>

<line>And hang him up where they had bound him.</line> 
<line>Sure never was an hapless wight</line> 
<line>In more uncomfortable plight ;</line>

<line>Unshelter'd by one lock of hair ;</line>

<line>His hat and peruke both forsook him.</line> 
<line>The insect world were on the wing,</line> 
<line>Whose talent is to buz and sting ;</line> 
<line>And soon his bare-worn head they sought,</line> 
<line>By instinct led, by nature taught ;</line> 
<line>And dug their little forks within</line> 
<line>The tender texture of his skin.</line> 
<line>He rag'd and roar'd, but all in vain,</line>
<line>No means he found to ease his pain.</line>
<line>The cords, which to the tree had tied him,</line> 
<line>All help from either hand denied him :</line>

<line>Nay, I throughout the night may stay,</line> 
<line>'Tis such an unfrequented way :</line> 
<line>Tho' what with hunger, thirst and fright,</line> 
<line>I ne'er shall last throughout the night ;</line> 
<line>And could I e'en these ills survive,</line> 
<line>The flies will eat me up alive.</line> 
<line>What mad ambition made me roam !</line> 
<line>Ah, wherefore did I quit my home !</line> 
<line>For there I liv'd, remote from harm ;</line> 
<line>My meals were good, my house was warm ;</line> 
<line>And, tho' I was not free from strife,</line> 
<line>With other ills that trouble life,</line> 
<line>Yet I had learn'd full well to bear</line> 
<line>The nightly scold, the daily care ;</line> 
<line>And, after many a season past,</line> 
<line>I should have found repose at last :</line> 
<line>Fate would have sign'd my long release,</line> 
<line>And Syntax would have died in peace ;</line> 
<line>Nor thus been robb'd, and tied and beaten,</line> 
<line>And all alive by insects eaten."</line> 
</stanza>

<line>But while he thus at Fate was railing,</line>
<line>And Fortune's angry frown bewailing,</line>

<pb n="15" />
 
<line>A dog's approaching bark he hears ;</line> 
<line>'Tis sweet as music to his ears,</line> 
<line>And soon a sure relief appears.</line>
<line>For, tho' it bore that gen'ral form,</line>
<line>Which oft at home, foretold a storm,</line> 
<line>It now appear'd an angel's shape</line> 
<line>That promis'd him a quick escape :</line> 
<line>Nor did La Mancha's val'rous knight</line> 
<line>Feel greater pleasure at the sight,</line> 
<line>When, overwhelm'd with love and awe,</line> 
<line>His Dulcinea first he saw : - -</line> 
<line>For on two trotting palfreys came,</line> 
<line>And each one bore a comely dame :</line> 
<line>They started as his form they view ;</line> 
<line>The horses, also, started too :</line> 
<line>The dog with insult seem'd to treat him,</line> 
<line>And look'd as if he long'd to eat him.</line> 
<line>In piteous tones he humbly pray'd</line> 
<line>They'd turn aside, and give him aid ;</line> 
<line>When each leap'd quickly from her steed,</line> 
<line>To join in charitable deed.</line> 
<line>They drew their knives to cut the noose,</line>
<line>And let the mounful pris'ner loose ;</line> 
<line>With kindest words his fate bewail,</line> 
<line>While grateful Syntax tells his tale.</line> 
<line>The rustic matrons sooth his grief,</line> 
<line>Nor offer, but afford, relief ;</line> 
<line>And, turning from the beaten road,</line>
<line>Their well-lin'd panniers they unload ;</line> 
<line>When soon upon the bank appear'd</line> 
<line>A sight his fainting spirits cheer'd.</line>
<line>They spread the fare with cheerful grace,</line> 
<line>And gave a banquet to the place :</line>

<pb n="16" />
 
<line>Most haply, too, as they untied him,</line>
<line>He saw his hat and wig beside him :</line> 
<line>So, thus bewigg'd and thus behatted,</line> 
<line>Down on the grass the Doctor squatted ;</line> 
<line>He then uplifted either eye,</line> 
<line>With grateful accents to the sky.</line> 
<line>" 'Tis thus," he humbly said, " we read</line> 
<line>In sacred books of heav'nly deed :</line> 
<line>And thus, I find, in my distress,</line> 
<line>The manna of the wilderness :</line> 
<line>'Tis Hermit's fare ; but thanks to Heaven,</line> 
<line>And those kind souls by whom 'tis given."</line> 
<line>'Tis true that bread, and curds, and fruit,</line> 
<line>Do with the pious hermits suit ;</line> 
<line>But Syntax surely was mistaken</line> 
<line>To think their meals partake of bacon ;</line> 
<line>Or that those reverend men regale,</line> 
<line>As our good Doctors do - - with ale :</line> 
<line>And these kind dames, in nothing loth,</line> 
<line>Took care that he partook of both.</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>At length 'twas time to bid adieu,</line>
<line>And each their diff'rent way pursue :</line> 
<line>A kind farewell, a kiss as kind,</line>
<line>He gave them both with heart and mind :</line>
<line>Then off he trudg'd, and, as he walk'd,</line>
<line>Thus to himself the Parson talk'd.</line> 
<line>" 'Tis well, I think, it is no worse,</line>
<line>For I have only lost my purse.</line>
<line>With all their cruelty and pains,</line> 
<line>The rogues have got but trifling gains ;</line> 
<line>Poor four and-four-pence is the measure</line> 
<line>Of all their mighty pilfer'd treasure ;</line>

<pb n="17" />
 
<line>For haply there was no divining </line>
<line>I'd a snug pocket in my lining :</line> 
<line>And, thanks to Spousy, ev'ry note</line> 
<line>Was well sew'd up within my coat.</line> 
<line>But where is Grizzle ? - - Never mind her ;</line> 
<line>I'll have her cried, and soon shall find her."</line> 
<line>Thus he pursu'd the winding way,</line>
<line>Big with the evils of the day :</line> 
<line>Though the good Doctor kept in view</line> 
<line>The favour of its blessings too.</line> 
<line>Nor had he pac'd it half an hour</line> 
<line>Before he saw a parish tow'r,</line>
<line>And soon, with sore fatigue opprest,</line> 
<line>An inn receiv'd him as its guest :</line>
<line>But still his mind, with anxious care,</line> 
<line>Ponder'd upon his wand'ring mare :</line>
<line>He therefore sent the Bellman round,</line> 
<line>To try if Grizzle might be found.</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Grizzle, ungrateful to her master,</line> 
<line>And careless of his foul disaster,</line> 
<line>Left him tied up, and took her way,</line> 
<line>In hopes to meet with com or hay ;</line> 
<line>But, as that did not come to pass,</line>
<line>She sought a meadow fiill of grass :</line> 
<line>The farmer in the meadow found her,</line> 
<line>And order'd John, his man, to pound her.</line> 
<line>Now John was one of those droll folk,</line> 
<line>Who oft take mischief for a joke ;</line> 
<line>And thought 'twould make the master stare,</line> 
<line>When he again beheld his mare,</line> 
<line>(Perhaps the gem'man might be shockt)</line> 
<line>To find her ready cropt and dockt :</line> 
<line>At all events, he play'd his fun :</line> 
<line>No sooner was it said than done.</line>

<pb n="18" />
 
<line>But Grizzle was a patient beast,</line> 
<line>And minded nought, if she could feast :</line> 
<line>Like many others, prone to think</line> 
<line>The best of life was meat and drink ;</line> 
<line>Who feel to-day nor care nor sorrow,</line> 
<line>If they are sure to feast to-morrow.</line> 
<line>Thus Grizzle, as she pac'd around</line> 
<line>The purlieu of the barren pound,</line> 
<line>In hungry mood might seem to neigh - -</line> 
<line>" If I had water, corn, and hay,</line> 
<line>I should not thus my fate bewail,</line> 
<line>Nor mourn the loss of ears or tail."</line>
</stanza> 

<stanza>
<line>In the mean time, securely hous'd,</line> 
<line>The Doctor booz'd it, and carous'd,</line>
<line>The Hostess spread her fairest cheer,</line> 
<line>Her best beef-steak, her strongest beer ;</line> 
<line>And sooth'd him with her winning chat,</line>
<line>Of  " Pray eat this - - and now take that.</line> 
<line>Your Rev'rence, after all your fright,</line> 
<line>Wants meat and drink, to set you right."</line> 
<line>His Rev'rence prais'd the golden rule,</line> 
<line>Nor did he let his victuals cool :</line>
<line>And, having drunk his liquor out,</line> 
<line>He took a turn to look about ; - -</line> 
<line>When to the folks about the door</line> 
<line>He told the dismal story o'er.</line>
<line>The country-people on him gaz'd,</line> 
<line>And heard his perils all amaz'd :</line> 
<line>How the thieves twin'd the cords around him ;</line>
<line>How to a tree the villains bound him :</line> 
<line>What angels came to his relief,</line> 
<line>To loose his bonds, and soothe his grief :</line>
<line>His loss of cash, and what was worse,</line> 
<line>His saddle, saddle-bags, and horse.</line> 

<pb n="19" />

<line>Thus as their rude attention hung</line> 
<line>Upon the wonders of his tongue,</line> 
<line>Lo ! Grizzle's alter'd form appears,</line> 
<line>With half its tail, and half its ears !</line> 
<line>"Is there no law?" the Doctor cries : - -</line> 
<line>" Plenty," a lawyer straight replies :</line> 
<line>" Employ me, and those thieves shall swing</line> 
<line>On gallows-tree, in hempen-string :</line> 
<line>And, for the rogue, the law shall flea him,</line> 
<line>Who maim'd your horse, as now you see him."</line> 
<line>"No," quoth the Don, "your pardon pray;</line> 
<line>I've had enough of thieves to-day :</line> 
<line>I've lost four shillings and a groat,</line> 
<line>But you would strip me of my coat :</line> 
<line>And ears and tail won't fatten you,</line> 
<line>You'll want the head and carcase too."</line> 
<line>He chuckled as he made the stroke,</line> 
<line>And all around enjoy'd the joke :</line> 
<line>But still it was a sorry sight</line> 
<line>To see the beast in such a plight :</line> 
<line>Yet what could angry Syntax do ?</line> 
<line>'Twas all in vain to fret and stew : - -</line>
<line>His well-stuff'd bags, with all their hoard</line> 
<line>Of sketching-tools, were safe restor'd ;</line> 
<line>The saddle, too, which he had sought</line> 
<line>For small reward was quickly brought ;</line> 
<line>He therefore thought it far more sage</line> 
<line>To stop his threats and check his rage ;</line> 
<line>So to the ostler's faithful care</line> 
<line>He gave his mutilated mare ;</line> 
<line>And while poor Grizzle, free from danger,</line> 
<line>Cropp'd the full rack and clean'd the manger,</line> 
<line>Syntax, to ease his aching head,</line> 
<line>Smok'd out his pipe, and went to bed.</line>

<line>Where cooling unguents would avail</line> 
<line>To save poor Grizzle's ears and tail !"</line> 
<line>When scarce had he his wishes spoke,</line>
<line>Than he beheld a cloud of smoke,</line>

<pb n="29" />

<line>That from a forge appear'd to rise</line>
<line>And for a moment veil'd the skies ;</line>
<line>While the rude hammers, to his ear,</line> 
<line>Proclaim'd the aid he wish'd was near.</line> 
<line>By the way-side the cottage rose,</line> 
<line>Around it many a willow grows,</line> 
<line>Where Syntax, in a tone of grief,</line> 
<line>Shew'd Grizzle's wounds, and pray'd relief.</line> 
<line>The sooty Galen soon appear'd,</line> 
<line>And with fair hopes the Doctor cheer'd.</line> 
<line>" Trust me, good Sir, I've got a plaster,</line> 
<line>Will cure the beast of her disaster ;</line> 
<line>And while the dressing I prepare,</line> 
<line>With all becoming skill and care,</line> 
<line>You in that arbour may regale</line>
<line>With a cool pipe and jug of ale :</line> 
<line>I've long a two-fold trade profess'd,</line>
<line>And med'cine sell for man and beast."</line> 
<line>Syntax now sought the cooling shade,</line> 
<line>While Galen's dame the banquet made :</line> 
<line>She well knew how her guests to please,</line> 
<line>And added meat, and bread, and cheese :</line> 
<line>Besides, she told the village-tale - -</line> 
<line>Who came to drink their home-brew'd ale ;</line> 
<line>How that the laughter-loving Vicar</line> 
<line>Would sometimes walk to taste their liquor ;</line> 
<line>That their gay landlord was renown'd,</line>
<line>For hunting fox, with horn and hound ;</line> 
<line>That he'd a daughter passing fair,</line>
<line>Who was his honour's only heir ;</line> 
<line>But she was proud, nor could a 'Squire</line> 
<line>Approach to tell his am'rous fire ;</line> 
<line>A Lord alone, as it was said,</line> 
<line>She wou'd receive into her bed.</line> 

<pb n="30" />

<line>Throughout the village, ev'ry name</line>
<line>Became a subject for the dame ;</line> 
<line>And thus she play'd her chatt'ring part,</line> 
<line>Till Syntax thought it time to part.</line>

<line>And now poor Grizzle, re-appears,</line> 
<line>With plaster'd tail, and plaster'd ears,</line>
<line>Which thus cas'd up, might well defy</line> 
<line>The sharpest sting of gnat or fly.</line> 
<line>The Doctor having had his fill,</line> 
<line>Without a word discharg'd his bill :</line> 
<line>But, as it was the close of day,</line>
<line>He trotted briskly on his way ;</line> 
<line>And, e'er the Sun withdrew his light,</line> 
<line>An Inn receiv'd him for the night.</line> 
<line>His frame fatigu'd, his mind oppress'd,</line> 
<line>He tiff'd his punch, and went to rest.</line> 
<line>The morning came, when he arose</line>
<line>In spirits from his calm repose ;</line> 
<line>And, while the maid prepar'd the tea,</line> 
<line>He look'd around the room to see</line> 
<line>What story did the walls disclose,</line> 
<line>Of human joys, of human woes.</line> 
<line>The window quickly caught his eye,</line> 
<line>On whose clear panes he could descry</line> 
<line>The motley works of many a Muse :</line> 
<line>There was enough to pick and choose ;</line>

<line>Some of these lines into my book ;</line> 
<line>For here there are both grave and witty,</line>

<line>Now, undisturb'd, he took his way,</line>

<line>Next morning, at an early hour,</line>

<line>And, as he curious look'd around,</line> 
<line>He saw a spot of rising ground,</line>
<line>From whence the turrets of the city</line>
<line>Would make a picture very pretty ;</line> 
<line>Where <i>Radcliff</i>'s dome would intervene,</line> 
<line>And <i>Magd'len</i> tower crown the scene.</line> 
<line>So Grizzle to a hedge he tied,</line>
<line>And onward he impatient hied ;</line> 
<line>But, as he sought to choose a part</line> 
<line>Where he might best display his art,</line> 
<line>A wicked bull no sooner view'd him,</line> 
<line>Than loud he roar'd, and straight pursu'd him.</line> 
<line>The Doctor finding danger near,</line> 
<line>Flew swiftly on the wings of Fear,</line> 
<line>And nimbly clamber'd up a tree,</line>
<line>That gave him full security ;</line> 
<line>But as he ran to save his bacon,</line> 
<line>By hat and wig he was forsaken ;</line> 
<line>His <i>sketch-book</i> too he left behind,</line> 
<line>A prey to the unlucky wind ;</line>
<line>While Grizzle, startled by the rout,</line> 
<line>Broke from the hedge, and pranc'd about.</line> 
<line>Syntax, still trembling with affright,</line> 
<line>Clung to the tree with all his might ;</line>

<pb n="41" />
 
<line>Then call'd for help - - and help was near,</line> 
<line>For dogs, and men, and boys appear ;</line> 
<line>So that his foe was forc'd to yield,</line> 
<line>And leave him master of the field.</line> 
<line>No more of roaring bulls afraid,</line> 
<line>He left the tree's protecting shade ;</line> 
<line>And as he pac'd the meadow round,</line> 
<line>His hat, his wig, his book he found.</line> 
<line>" Come, my old girl," the Doctor said ;</line> 
<line>The faithful steed the call obey'd,</line> 
<line>So Grizzle once more he bestrode,</line> 
<line>Nor look'd behind - - but off he rode.</line>

<line>ALONG the varying road of Life,</line> 
<line>In calm content, in toil or strife ;</line> 
<line>At morn or noon, by night or day,</line> 
<line>As time conducts him on his way.</line> 
<line>How oft doth man, by Care oppress'd,</line> 
<line>Find in an Inn a place of rest ?</line> 
<line>Whether intent on worldly views,</line> 
<line>He, in deep thought, his way pursues ;</line> 
<line>Whether by airy Pleasure led,</line> 
<line>Or by Hope's fond delusions fed,</line>
<line>He bids adieu to home, and strays</line> 
<line>Through unknown paths and distant ways ;</line>
<line>Where'er his fancy bids him roam,</line> 
<line>In ev'ry Inn he finds a home.</line> 
<line>Should Fortune change her fav'ring wind,</line> 
<line>Tho' former friends should prove unkind,</line> 
<line>Will not an Inn his cares beguile,</line> 
<line>Where on each face he sees a smile ?</line> 
<line>When cold winds blow, and tempests lour,</line> 
<line>And the rain pours in angry show'r,</line> 
<line>The dripping trav'ller looks around,</line> 
<line>To see what shelter may be found ;</line>
<line>Then on he drives, thro' thick and thin,</line> 
<line>To the warm shelter of an Inn.</line> 
<line>Whoe'er would turn their wand'ring feet,</line>
<line>Assur'd the kindest smiles to meet ;</line>

<line>But with kind wishes from the heart,</line> 
<line>O let them quit the world's loud din,</line> 
<line>And seek the comforts of an Inn :</line> 
<line>And as the Doric Shenstone sung,</line> 
<line>With plaintive music on his tongue - -</line>
<line>" Whoe'er has travell'd Life's dull round,</line>

<line>'Twas at an Inn, in calm repose,</line> 
<line>Heedless of human joys or woes,</line> 
<line>That Syntax pass'd a quiet night</line> 
<line>In pleasing dreams and slumbers light :</line> 
<line>But in the morn the thunder roar'd,</line> 
<line>The clouds their streaming torrents pour'd :</line> 
<line>The angry winds impetuous blew,</line> 
<line>The rattling casement open flew.</line>
<line>Scar'd at the noise, he rear'd his head ;</line> 
<line>Then, starting quickly from the bed,</line> 
<line>" Is it," he cried, " the day of doom ?"</line>

<line>The houses' tops with water stream'd,</line> 
<line>The village-street a river seem'd :</line>
<line>While, at the tempest all amaz'd,</line> 
<line>The rustics from their windows gaz'd.</line> 
<line>" I'm not," he said, " dispos'd to fear,</line>

<line>I'll change the scene ; I'll soon retire</line> 
<line>From flaming flash to kitchen fire :</line> 
<line>And, while rude Nature's threats prevail,</line> 
<line>I'll lose the storm in toast and ale."</line> 
<line>Half-dress'd he made a quick retreat,</line> 
<line>And in the kitchen took his seat,</line>

<pb n="67" />
 
<line>Where an old woman told the Host,</line> 
<line>What by the lightning she had lost ;</line> 
<line>How a blue flash her sow had struck,</line> 
<line>Had kill'd a cock, and lam'd a duck.</line>
<line>With open mouth another came,</line> 
<line>To tell a rick was in a flame ;</line>
<line>And then declar'd that on the spire</line> 
<line>He saw the weathercock on fire :</line> 
<line>Nay, that so loud the winds were singing,</line> 
<line>They'd set the peal of bells a-ringing.</line>
<line>A dripping tailor enter'd next,</line> 
<line>And preach'd upon the self-same text :</line> 
<line>He swore, that sitting on his board,</line> 
<line>While the wind blew and thunder roar'd,</line> 
<line>A kind of fiery flame came pop,</line> 
<line>And bounc'd, and ran about his shop ;</line> 
<line>Now here, now there, so quick and nimble,</line> 
<line>It sing'd his finger through his thimble ;</line> 
<line>That all about his needles ran,</line> 
<line>If there was any truth in man ;</line> 
<line>While buttons, at least half a score,</line> 
<line>Were driven thro' the kitchen door.</line> 
<line>The Sexton, with important mien,</line> 
<line>Gave his opinion on the scene :</line>
<line>And, to the Doctor drawing near,</line>

<line>Tell me the prattle of our town ;</line>

<line>Upon a rock the castle stood,</line> 
<line>Three sides environ'd by a flood,</line> 
<line>Where confluent streams uniting lave,</line> 
<line>The craggy rift with foaming wave.</line> 
<line>Around the moss-clad walls he walk'd,</line> 
<line>Then thro' the inner chambers stalk'd ;</line>

<line>The echoes giving back the sound.</line>
<line>" Let me expatiate here awhile :</line> 
<line>I think this antiquated pile</line>

<line>To pray'r preferr'd a sumptuous treat,</line>

<line>Here all along the banners hung,</line> 
<line>And here the welcome minstrels sung :</line> 
<line>The walls with glitt'ring arms bedight,</line> 
<line>Display'd an animating sight :</line>

<line>With helmed crest, in warlike state</line> 
<line>The bands march'd forth, nor fear'd the toil,</line> 
<line>Of bloody war that gave the spoil.</line> 
<line>But now, alas ! no more remains</line>

<line>The palace of the feudal victor</line>
<line>Now serves for nought but for a picture.</line>

<poem>
<stanza>
<line>POOR mortal man, in ev'ry state,</line> 
<line>What troubles and what ills await!</line> 
<line>His transient joy is chas'd by sorrow, - -</line>
<line>To-day he's blest ; - - a wretch to-morrow.</line> 
<line>When in the world he first appears,</line> 
<line>He hails the light with cries and tears :</line> 
<line>A school-boy next, he fears the nod</line>
<line>Of pedant pow'r, and feels the rod :</line> 
<line>When to an active stripling grown,</line> 
<line>The Passions seize him as their own ;</line> 
<line>Now lead him here, now drive him there,</line> 
<line>Th'alternate sport of Joy and Care ;</line> 
<line>Allure him with their glitt'ring treasure,</line> 
<line>Or give the brimming cup of pleasure ;</line> 
<line>While one eludes his eager haste,</line> 
<line>The other palls upon the taste.</line> 
<line>The pointed darts from Cupid's quiver</line> 
<line>Wound his warm heart, and pierce his liver ;</line> 
<line>While charm'd by fair Belinda's eyes,</line> 
<line>He dines on groans, and sups on sighs.</line> 
<line>If from this gay and giddy round</line> 
<line>He should escape both safe and sound,</line> 
<line>Perhaps, if all things else miscarry,</line> 
<line>He takes it in his head to marry ;</line> 

<pb n="75" />

<line>And in this lottery of life,</line> 
<line>If he should draw a scolding wife,</line> 
<line>With a few children, eight or ten</line> 
<line>(For such things happen now and then),</line> 
<line>Poor hapless man ! he knows not where</line> 
<line>To look around without a care.</line> 
<line>Ambition, in its airy flight,</line> 
<line>May tempt him to some giddy height ;</line> 
<line>But, ere the point he can attain,</line> 
<line>He tumbles, ne'er to rise again.</line> 
<line>Pale Av'rice may his heart possess,</line> 
<line>The bane of human happiness,</line> 
<line>Which never feels for other's woe,</line> 
<line>Which never does a smile bestow ;</line> 
<line>A wretched, meagre, griping elf,</line> 
<line>A foe to all, and to himself.</line> 
<line>Then comes Disease, with baneful train,</line> 
<line>And all the family of Pain ;</line> 
<line>Till Death appears in awful state,</line> 
<line>And calls him to the realms of Fate.</line> 
<line>How oft is Virtue seen to feel</line> 
<line>The woeful turn of Fortune's wheel,</line> 
<line>While she with golden stores awaits</line> 
<line>The wicked in their very gates.</line> 
<line>But Virtue still the value knows</line> 
<line>Of honest deeds, and can repose</line> 
<line>Upon the flint her naked head ;</line>
<line>While Vice lays restless on the bed</line> 
<line>Of softest down, and courts in vain</line> 
<line>The opiate to relieve its pain.</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>It was not Vice that e'er could keep</line> 
<line>Poor Syntax from refreshing sleep ;</line>

<pb n="76" />
 
<line>For no foul thought, no wicked art,</line>
<line>In his pure life e'er bore a part :</line>
<line>Some ailment dire his slumbers broke,</line> 
<line>And, ere the sun arose, he woke :</line> 
<line>When such a tremor o'er him pass'd ;</line> 
<line>He thought that hour would prove his last.</line> 
<line>His limbs were all besieg'd by pain ;</line> 
<line>He now grew hot, then cold again :</line> 
<line>His tongue was parch'd, his lips were dry,</line> 
<line>And, heaving the unbidden sigh,</line>
<line>He rang the bell, and call'd for aid,</line> 
<line>And groan'd so loud, th' affrighted maid</line> 
<line>Spread the alarm throughout the house ; - -</line> 
<line>When straight the landlord and his spouse</line> 
<line>Made all despatch to do their best,</line> 
<line>And ease the sufferings of their guest.</line> 
<line>" Have you a doctor?" Syntax said ;</line> 
<line>" If not, I shortly shall be dead."</line> 
<line>" - - O yes ; a very famous man ;</line> 
<line>He'll cure you, Sir, if physic can.</line> 
<line>I'll fetch him quick ; - - a man renown'd</line> 
<line>For his great skill the country round."</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>The Landlord soon the Doctor brought,</line> 
<line>Whose words were grave, whose looks were thought :</line> 
<line>By the bed-side he took his stand,</line> 
<line>And felt the patient's burning hand ;</line> 
<line>Then, with a scientific face,</line> 
<line>He told the symptoms of the case : - -</line>
<line>" His frame's assail'd with fev'rish heats ;</line> 
<line>His pulse with rapid movement beats ; - -</line>
<line>And now, I think, 'twould do him good,</line> 
<line>Were he to lose a little blood :</line> 

<pb n="77" />

<line>Some other useful matters too,</line> 
<line>To ease his pain, I have in view.</line> 
<line>I'll just step home, and, in a trice,</line> 
<line>Will bring the fruits of my advice ;</line> 
<line>In the mean time, his thirst assuage</line> 
<line>With tea that's made of balm, or sage."</line> 
<line>He soon return'd - - his skill applied - -</line> 
<line>From the vein flow'd the crimson tide :</line> 
<line>And, as the folk behind him stand,</line>
<line>He thus declar'd his stern command :</line> 
<line>" At nine these <i>powders</i> let him take ;</line> 
<line>At ten this <i>draught,</i> - - the phial shake ;</line> 
<line>And you'll remember, at eleven,</line> 
<line>Three of these <i>pills</i> must then be given :</line> 
<line>This course you'll carefully pursue,</line> 
<line>And give, at twelve, the <i>bolus</i> too :</line> 
<line>If he should wander, in a crack</line> 
<line>Clap this broad <i>blister</i> on his back ;</line> 
<line>And, after he has had the blister,</line>
<line>Within an hour give the <i>clyster.</i></line> 
<line>I must be gone ; at three or four</line> 
<line>I shall return with <i>something more.</i>''</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Now Syntax and his fev'rish state</line>
<line>Became the subject of debate.</line> 
<line>The mistress said she was afraid</line> 
<line>No medicine would give him aid ;</line> 
<line>For she had heard the screech-owl scream,</line> 
<line>And had besides a horrid dream.</line> 
<line>Last night the candle burn'd so blue ;</line> 
<line>While from the fire a coffin flew ;</line> 
<line>And, as she sleepless lay in bed,</line> 
<line>She heard a death-watch at her head.</line> 

<pb n="78" />

<line>The maid and ostler too declar'd</line> 
<line>That noises strange they both had heard.</line> 
<line>" Aye," cried the Sexton, " these protend</line> 
<line>To the sick man a speedy end ;</line> 
<line>And, when that I have drunk my liquor,</line> 
<line>I'll e'en go straight and fetch the Vicar."</line>
</stanza> 

<stanza>
<line>The Vicar came, a worthy man,</line> 
<line>And, like a good Samaritan,</line> 
<line>Approach'd in haste the stranger's bed,</line> 
<line>Where Syntax lay with aching head ;</line> 
<line>And, without any fuss or pother,</line>
<line>He offer'd to his rev'rend brother</line> 
<line>His purse, his house, and all the care</line> 
<line>Which a kind heart could give him there.</line>
</stanza> 

<stanza>
<line>Says Syntax, in a languid voice,</line> 
<line>" You make my very soul rejoice ;</line> 
<line>For, if within this house I stay,</line> 
<line>My flesh will soon be turn'd to clay,</line> 
<line>For the good Doctor means to pop</line> 
<line>Into my stomach, all his shop.</line> 
<line>I think, dear Sir, that I could eat,</line> 
<line>And physic's but a nauseous treat : - -</line> 
<line>If all that stuff's to be endur'd,</line> 
<line>I shall be kill'd in being cur'd."</line> 
<line>" O," said the Vicar, " never fear ;</line> 
<line>We'll leave the apparatus here.</line> 
<line>Come, quit your bed - - I pray you, come, - -</line> 
<line>My arm shall bear you to my home,</line> 
<line>Where I, and my dear mate will find</line> 
<line>Med'cine more suited to your mind. "</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Syntax now rose, but feeble stood,</line> 
<line>From want of meat, and loss of blood ;</line>

<pb n="79" />
 
<line>But still he ventur'd to repair</line> 
<line>To the good Vicar's house and care ;</line> 
<line>And found at dinner pretty picking,</line> 
<line>In pudding boil'd and roasted chicken.</line> 
<line>Again, 'twas honest Grizzle's fate</line> 
<line>To take her way thro' church-yard gate ;</line> 
<line>And, undisturb'd, once more to riot</line> 
<line>In the green feast of church-yard diet.</line> 
<line>The Vicar was at Oxford bred,</line> 
<line>And had much learning in his head ;</line> 
<line>But, what was far the better part,</line> 
<line>He had much goodness in his heart.</line> 
<line>The Vicar also had a wife,</line> 
<line>The pride and pleasure of his life ;</line> 
<line>A loving, kind, and friendly creature,</line>
<line>As blest in virtue as in feature,</line>
<line>Who, without blisters, drugs, or pills,</line> 
<line>Her patient cur'd of all his ills.</line> 
<line>Three days he stay'd, a welcome guest,</line> 
<line>And eat and drank of what was best :</line> 
<line>When, on the fourth, in health renew'd,</line> 
<line>His anxious journey he pursu'd.</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>In two days more before his eyes</line> 
<line>The stately towers of York arise.</line> 
<line>" But what," said he, " can all this mean ?</line> 
<line>What is yon crowded busy scene ?</line> 
<line>Ten thousand souls, I do maintain,</line> 
<line>Are scatter'd over yonder plain."</line> 
<line>" Ay, more than that," a man replied, - -</line> 
<line>Who trotted briskly by his side,</line> 
<line>" And if you choose, I'll be your guide :</line> 
<line>For sure you will not pass this way,</line> 
<line>And miss the pleasure of the day.</line>

<pb n="80" />

<line>These are the races, to whose sport</line> 
<line>Nobles and gentry all resort."</line> 
<line>Thought Syntax I'll just take a look ;</line> 
<line>'Twill give a subject to my book.</line> 
<line>So on they went ; - - the highway friend</line> 
<line>His services did oft commend.</line> 
<line>" I will attend you to the course,</line> 
<line>And tell the name of ev'ry horse ;</line>
<line>But first we'll go and take a whet,</line> 
<line>And then I'll teach you how to bet :</line> 
<line>I'll name the horse that's doom'd to win - -</line> 
<line>We'll take the knowing fellows in."</line> 
<line>Just as he spoke, the sports began ;</line>
<line>The jockies whipp'd, the horses ran, - -</line> 
<line>And, when the coursers reach'd the post,</line> 
<line>The man scream'd out - - " Your horse has lost :</line> 
<line>I've had the luck - - I've won the day,</line> 
<line>And you have twenty pounds to pay."</line> 
<line>Syntax look'd wild - - the man said " Zounds !</line> 
<line>You know you betted twenty pounds ;</line> 
<line>So pay them down, or you'll fare worse,</line> 
<line>For I will flog you off the course."</line> 
<line>The Doctor rav'd, and disavow'd</line> 
<line>The bold assertion to the crowd.</line> 
<line>What would have been his hapless fate,</line> 
<line>In this most unexpected state,</line> 
<line>May well be guess'd. But, lo ! a friend</line> 
<line>Fortune was kind enough to send.</line> 
<line>An honest 'Squire, who smok'd the trick,</line> 
<line>Appear'd well arm'd with oaken stick,</line> 
<line>And, placing many a sturdy blow</line> 
<line>Upon the shoulders of the foe,</line> 
<line>" It is with all my soul I beat</line> 
<line>This vile, this most notorious cheat,"</line>

<pb n="81" /> 

<line>The 'Squire exclaim'd ; " and you, good folk,</line> 
<line>Who sometimes love a pleasant joke,</line> 
<line>As I am partly tir'd with thumping,</line> 
<line>Should treat the scoundrel with a pumping."</line> 
<line>The crowd, with their commission pleas'd,</line> 
<line>Rudely the trembling Black-leg seiz'd,</line> 
<line>Who, to their justice forc'd to yield,</line> 
<line>Soon ran off dripping from the field.</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Syntax his simple story told, - -</line> 
<line>The 'Squire, as kind as he was bold,</line> 
<line>His full protection now affords,</line> 
<line>And cheer'd him both with wine and words ; - -</line> 
<line>" I love the Clergy from my heart,</line> 
<line>And always take a Parson's part.</line> 
<line>My father, Doctor, wore the gown - -</line> 
<line>A better man was never known :</line> 
<line>But an old uncle, a poor elf,</line> 
<line>Who, to save riches, starv'd himself,</line> 
<line>By his last will bequeath'd me clear</line> 
<line>At least two thousand pounds a year,</line> 
<line>And sav'd me all the pains at college,</line> 
<line>To pour o'er books, and aim at knowledge.</line> 
<line>Thus free from care, I live at ease - -</line>
<line>Go where I will, do what I please - -</line>
<line>Pursue my sports, enjoy my pleasure,</line> 
<line>Nor envy Lords their splendid treasure.</line> 
<line>I have a house at York beside,</line> 
<line>Where you shall go and straight reside ;</line> 
<line>And ev'ry kindness shall be shown,</line> 
<line>Both for my dad's sake, and your own :</line> 
<line>For know, good Sir, I'm never loth</line> 
<line>To mark my friendship for the Cloth.</line> 
<line><i>Hearty</i>'s my name, and you shall find</line> 
<line>A welcome, Doctor, to your mind :</line>

<pb n="82" />
 
<line>And I've a wife, so blithe and gay,</line> 
<line>Who ne'er says <i>yes</i> when I say <i>nay</i>.''</line> 
<line>Syntax observ'd that was a blessing</line> 
<line>A man might boast of in possessing.</line>
</stanza> 

<stanza>
<line>At length arriv'd, a lady fair</line> 
<line>Receiv'd them with a winning air.</line> 
<line>" Ah," said the 'Squire, " I always come,</line> 
<line>My dearest girl, with pleasure home :</line> 
<line>You see a rev'rend Doctor here,</line> 
<line>So give him of your choicest cheer :</line> 
<line>" <i>Yes,</i>" she replied, " O <i>yes</i>, my dear."</line> 
<line>" Nor fail all kindness to bestow :"</line>

<line>IN this sad, variegated life,</line> 
<line>Evil and good, in daily strife,</line>

<line>To plague the purse-proud grocer's daughter ;</line>

<line>No one will be so fine as me.</line> 
<line>Oh ! with what pleasure and delight</line>

<line>These tender lines did not impart</line> 
<line>Much comfort to the Doctor's heart ;</line> 
<line>He therefore thought it would be better</line> 
<line>To lay aside this pretty letter ;</line> 
<line>Nor suffer its contents to sour</line> 
<line>The pleasure of the present hour.</line>

<stanza>
<line>The 'Squire now became his guide,</line>

<line>Beheld the scene of the review.</line> 
<line>The troops drawn up in proud array,</line> 
<line>An animating sight display :</line> 
<line>The well-form'd squadrons wheel around - -</line> 
<line>The standards wave, the trumpets sound ;</line>

<pb n="89" />
 
<line>When Grizzle, long matur'd to war,</line> 
<line>And not without an honour'd scar,</line> 
<line>Found all her former spirits glow</line>
<line>As when she us'd to meet the foe :</line> 
<line>No ears she prick'd, for she had none :</line> 
<line>Nor cock'd her tail, for that was gone ;</line> 
<line>But still she snorted, foam'd, and flounc'd ;</line> 
<line>Then up she rear'd, and off she bounc'd ;</line> 
<line>And, having play'd these pretty pranks,</line> 
<line>Dash'd all at once into the ranks ;</line>
<line>While Syntax, tho' unus'd to fear,</line> 
<line>Suspected that his end was near :</line> 
<line>But, tho' his courage 'gan to addle,</line> 
<line>He still stuck close upon his saddle ;</line> 
<line>While, to the trumpets on the hill,</line> 
<line>Grizzle sped fast, and then stood still :</line> 
<line>With them she clos'd her warlike race,</line> 
<line>And took with pride her ancient place ;</line> 
<line>For Grizzle, as we've told before,</line>
<line>Once to the wars a trumpet bore.</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>At length, recover'd from his fright,</line> 
<line>The Doctor stay'd and view'd the sight ;</line> 
<line>And then, with heart as light as cork,</line> 
<line>He with his friend jogg'd back to York,</line> 
<line>Where was renew'd the friendly fare,</line> 
<line>And ev'ry comfort promis'd there.</line> 
<line>The time in chit-chat pass'd away,</line> 
<line>Till the chimes told the closing day :</line> 
<line>And now, says pleasant Madam Hearty,</line> 
<line>What think you if our little party</line> 
<line>Should each to sing a song agree ?</line> 
<line>'Twill give a sweet variety.</line> 
<line>Thus, let the passing moments roll,</line>

<pb n="90" />
 
<line>The Doctor, sure, will do his best</line>
<line>And kindly grant my poor request.</line> 
<line>The Doctor, tho' by nature grave,</line> 
<line>And rather form'd to tune a stave,</line> 
<line>Whene'er he got a little mellow,</line> 
<line>Was a most merry, pleasant fellow ;</line> 
<line>Would sing a song, or tell a riddle,</line> 
<line>Or play a hornpipe on the fiddle ;</line>
<line>And, being now a little gay,</line> 
<line>Declar'd his wishes to obey.</line> 
<line>Then I'll begin, 'Squire Hearty said,</line> 
<line>But tho' by land my tours are made,</line> 
<line>Whene'er I tune a song, or glee,</line> 
<line>I quit the land, and go to sea.</line>

<line>LIFE is a journey : - - on we go</line>
<line>Thro' many a scene of joy and woe :</line> 
<line>Time flits along, and will not stay,</line>
<line>Nor let us linger on the way : - -</line>
<line>Like as a stream, whose varying course</line>
<line>Now rushes with impetuous force ;</line> 
<line>Now in successive eddies plays,</line>
<line>Or in meanders gently strays,</line>
<line>It still moves on, till spreading wide,</line> 
<line>It mingles with the briny tide ;</line> 
<line>And, when it meets the ocean's roar,</line> 
<line>The limpid waves are seen no more.</line> 
<line>Such, such is life's uncertain way : - -</line> 
<line>Now the sun wakes th' enlivening day :</line> 
<line>The scene around enchants the sight ;</line> 
<line>To cool retreat the shades invite :</line> 
<line>The blossoms balmy fragrance shed ;</line> 
<line>The meads a verdant carpet spread ;</line> 
<line>While the clear rill reflects below</line> 
<line>The flow'rs that on its margin grow ;</line> 
<line>And the sweet songsters of the grove</line> 
<line>Attune to harmony and love.</line> 
<line>But, lo ! the clouds obscure the sky,</line> 
<line>And tell the blust'ring tempest nigh :</line>

<pb n="95" /> 

<line>The livid flash, the pelting storm,</line> 
<line>Fair Nature's ev'ry grace deform ;</line> 
<line>While their assailing powers annoy</line> 
<line>The pensive pilgrim's tranquil joy :</line> 
<line>But, tho' no tempest should molest</line> 
<line>The Bower where he stops to rest,</line> 
<line>Care will not let him long remain,</line> 
<line>But sets him on his way again.</line> 
<line>Thus Syntax, whom the 'Squire had press'd</line> 
<line>For three whole months to take his rest,</line> 
<line>Sigh'd when he found he could not stay</line> 
<line>To loiter thro' another day :</line> 
<line>" No," he exclaim'd, " I must away : - -</line> 
<line>I have a splendid book to make,</line> 
<line>To form a tour, - - to paint a lake ;</line> 
<line>And, by that well-projected <i>tome,</i></line>

<line>When the sun told another day.</line> 
<line>Nor long the downy couch he press'd,</line>

<line>Besides, I mean to recommend</line> 
<line>Your labours to a noble friend,</line> 
<line>Who well is known to rank as high</line> 
<line>In learning, as in quality ;</line> 
<line>Who can your merits well review ;</line> 
<line>A statesman, and a poet too :</line>
<line>He will your genius truly scan,</line> 
<line>And, tho' a lord, a learned man.</line> 
<line>For C* * * * * * is an honour'd name,</line>

<line>That courteous Lord doth condescend</line>

<line>The letter Syntax long'd to have ;</line>

<line>On which two coal-black words were wrote ;</line> 
<line>The sight of which his sense confounds,</line> 
<line>For these said words were Twenty Pounds.</line> 
<line>" Check," said the 'Squire, " your wond'ring look ;</line>

<line>But cups like these ne'er lasted long :</line> 
<line>And Syntax stammer'd, " Do you see ?</line> 
<line>Now I'm of this fam'd cellar free,</line>

<line>I wish I might be quickly led</line> 
<line>T' enjoy my freedom in a bed."</line> 
<line>He wish'd but once, and was obey'd</line>

<poem>
<stanza>
<line>HOW oft, as thro' Life's vale we stray,</line> 
<line>Doth Fancy light us on the way !</line> 
<line>How oft, with many a vision bright,</line> 
<line>Doth she the wayward heart delight ;</line> 
<line>And, with a fond enliv'ning smile,</line> 
<line>The heavy hour of care beguile !</line> 
<line>But tho' so oft she scatters flowers,</line> 
<line>To make more gay our waking hours;</line> 
<line>Night is the time when o'er the soul</line>
<line>She exercises full control.</line> 
<line>While Life's more active functions pause,</line> 
<line>And sleep its sable curtain draws,</line>
<line>'Tis then she waves her fairy wand :</line> 
<line>And strange things rise at her command : - -</line> 
<line>She then assumes her motley reign,</line> 
<line>And man lives o'er his life again ;</line> 
<line>While many an airy dream invites</line> 
<line>Her wizard masks, her wanton sprites :</line> 
<line>Thro' the warm brain the phantoms play,</line> 
<line>And form a visionary day.</line>
</stanza> 

<stanza>
<line>Thus Syntax, while the bed he prest,</line>
<line>And pass'd the night in balmy rest,</line>
<line>Was led in those unconscious hours,</line> 
<line>By Fancy, to her fairy bow'rs,</line> 
<line>Where the light spirits wander free</line> 
<line>In whimsical variety.</line> 
</stanza>

<pb n="105" />

<stanza>
<line>No more an humble Curate, now,</line> 
<line>He feels a mitre on his brow ;</line> 
<line>The mildew'd surplice, now withdrawn,</line> 
<line>Yields to the fine, transparent lawn ;</line> 
<line>And peruke, that defied all weather,</line> 
<line>Is nicely dress'd to ape a feather.</line> 
<line>Grizzle no more is seen to wail,</line> 
<line>Her mangled ears and butcher'd tail ; - -</line> 
<line>Six Grizzles now, with ev'ry ear,</line> 
<line>And all their flowing tails appear ;</line> 
<line>When, harness'd to a light barouche,</line> 
<line>The ground they do not seem to touch :</line> 
<line>Whirl'd onward in a wild surprise,</line> 
<line>The air-blown prelate thinks he flies.</line> 
<line>Now thro' the long cathedral aisle,</line> 
<line>Where vergers bow and virgins smile,</line> 
<line>With measur'd step and solemn air,</line> 
<line>He gains at length the sacred chair ;</line> 
<line>And to the crowd, with look profound,</line> 
<line>Bestows his holy blessing round.</line> 
<line>Above the pealing organs blow,</line> 
<line>To the respondent choir below ;</line> 
<line>When, bending to Religion's shrine,</line> 
<line>He feels an energy divine.</line> 
<line>Now, 'scap'd from Dolly's angry clutches,</line> 
<line>He thinks he's married to a Duchess ;</line> 
<line>And that her rank and glowing beauty</line> 
<line>Enlivens his prelatic duty.</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Thus Fancy, with her antic train,</line> 
<line>Pass'd nimbly thro' the Doctor's brain ;</line> 
<line>But, while she told her varying story</line> 
<line>Of short-liv'd pomp and fading glory,</line> 
<line>A voice upon the vision broke, - -</line>
<line>When Syntax gave a grunt - - and woke.</line>

<line>" And may it please you, I've a word</line> 
<line>To tell your Rev'rence, from my Lord."</line> 
<line>" A Lord," he cried, " why, to be free,</line> 
<line>I've been as good a lord as he :</line> 
<line>Throughout the night, I've been as great</line> 
<line>As any Lord, with all his state :</line> 
<line>But now that fine-drawn scene is o'er,</line> 
<line>And I'm poor Syntax as before.</line> 
<line>You spoil'd my fortune, 'tis most certain,</line> 
<line>The moment you withdrew the curtain :</line>
<line>So, if you please, my pretty maid,</line> 
<line>You'll tell me what my Lord has said."</line> 
<line>" - - My Lord has sent to let you know</line> 
<line>That breakfast is prepar'd below."</line> 
<line>" - - Let my respects upon him wait,</line> 
<line>And say that I'll be with him straight."</line> 
<line>Out then he bounc'd upon the floor :</line> 
<line>The maid ran shouting thro' the door, - -</line> 
<line>So much the figure of the Doctor,</line> 
<line>In his unrob'd condition shock'd her.</line>
</stanza> 

<stanza>
<line>Syntax now hasten'd to obey</line> 
<line>The early summons of the day.</line> 
<line>He humbly bow'd, and took his seat ;</line> 
<line>Nor did his Lordship fail to greet</line> 
<line>With kindest words his rev'rend guest - -</line> 
<line>As how he had enjoy'd his rest ;</line> 
<line>Hop'd ev'ry comfort he had found ;</line> 
<line>That his night's slumbers had been sound ;</line> 
<line>And that he was prepar'd to share</line> 
<line>With keen regard, his morning's fare.</line> 
<line>The Doctor smil'd, and soon made free</line> 
<line>With my Lord's hospitality ;</line> 
<line>Then told aloud his golden dream,</line> 
<line>Which prov'd of mirth a fruitful theme.</line>

<pb n="107" />
 
<line>" 'Tis true," he said, " when I awoke,</line> 
<line>The charm dissolv'd, the spell was broke ;</line> 
<line>The mitre and its grand display,</line> 
<line>With my fine wife, all pass'd away.</line>
<line>Th' awak'ning voice my fortune cross'd ;</line> 
<line>I op'd my eyes, and all was lost ;</line> 
<line>But still I find, to my delight,</line> 
<line>I have not lost my appetite."</line>

<line>" As for the mitre and the gold,</line> 
<line>Which Fancy gave you to behold,</line>

<line>" Your sport, my Lord, I cannot take,</line> 
<line>For I must go and hunt a lake ;</line> 
<line>And while you chase the flying deer,</line> 
<line>I must fly off to <i>Windermere.</i></line>
<line>'Stead of hallooing to a fox,</line> 
<line>I must catch echoes from the rocks,</line> 
<line>With curious eye and active scent,</line> 
<line>I on the <i>picturesque</i> am bent.</line>
<line>This is my game ; I must pursue it,</line> 
<line>And make it where I cannot view it.</line> 
<line>Tho' in good truth, but do not flout me,</line> 
<line>I bear that self-same thing about me.</line> 
<line>If in man's form you wish to see</line> 
<line>The <i>picturesque</i> - - pray look at me.</line> 
<line>I am myself without a flaw,</line> 
<line>The very <i>picturesque</i> I draw.</line> 
<line>A Rector, on whose face so sleek</line> 
<line>In vain you for a wrinkle seek ;</line> 
<line>In whose fair form, so fat and round,</line> 
<line>No obtuse angle's to be found ;</line>
<line>On such a shape no man of taste</line> 
<line>Would his fine tints or canvass waste :</line> 
<line>But take a Curate who's so thin,</line> 
<line>His bones seem peeping thro' his skin ;</line> 
<line>Make him to stand, or walk, or sit,</line> 
<line>In any posture you think fit ;</line>

<pb n="109" />

<line>And, with all these nice points about him,</line> 
<line>No well-taught painter e'er would scout him ;</line>

<line>He'd give effect to any scene.</line> 
<line>In my poor beast, as well as me,</line> 
<line>A fine example you may see :</line> 
<line>She's so abrupt in all her parts - -</line> 
<line>O what fine subjects for the arts !</line> 
<line>Thus we travel on together,</line> 
<line>With gentle gale or stormy weather ;</line> 
<line>And, tho' we trot along the plains,</line> 
<line>Where one dead level ever reigns,</line> 
<line>Or pace where rocks and mountains rise,</line> 
<line>Who lift their heads, and brave the skies ;</line> 
<line>I Doctor Syntax, and my horse,</line> 
<line>Give to the landscape double force.</line> 
<line> - - I have no doubt I shall produce</line> 
<line>A volume of uncommon use,</line> 
<line>That will be worthy to be plac'd</line> 
<line>Beneath the eye of men of taste ;</line> 
<line>And I should hope, my Lord, that you</line> 
<line>Will praise it, and protect it too ;</line> 
<line>Will let your all-sufficient name</line> 
<line>The double patronage proclaim :</line>

<line>When, lo, a threat'ning storm appear'd :</line> 
<line>Phoebus the scene no longer cheer'd :</line> 
<line>The dark clouds sink on ev'ry hill :</line> 
<line>The floating mists the valleys fill :</line> 
<line>Nature, transform'd, began to lour,</line>

<line>That we the <i>picturesque</i> may find</line> 
<line>In thunder loud, or whistling wind :</line> 
<line>And often, as I fully ween,</line> 
<line>It may be heard as well as seen ;</line>

<line>A sound as it can paint a place,</line> 
<line>The pen, in its poetic rage,</line> 
<line>Can make it figure on the page."</line>

<line>A fisherman, who pass'd that way,</line>

<line>On horseback too you'll ne'er be able - -</line>

<line>" Thanks," Syntax said, " for your advice,</line>

<line>I'll seek a table at the Inn ; - -</line> 
<line>But Grizzle, in her haste to pass,</line>

<line>To that warm Inn they quickly hied,</line>

<line>Sat, in the landlord's garments clad,</line>

<line>How true the light and shade are shed.</line> 
<line>Indeed I should prefer by half,</line> 
<line>To a fine colt, a common calf :</line> 
<line>The unshorn sheep, the shaggy goat,</line> 
<line>The ass with rugged, ragged coat,</line>

<pb n="127" />
 
<line>Who often says she might have seen</line> 
<line>Her husband a fine, pompous Dean ; - -</line> 
<line>Indeed, she sometimes thinks her spouse</line> 
<line>Might have a mitre on his brows,</line> 
<line>If, putting scruples out of view,</line> 
<line>He'd do as other people do.</line> 
<line>No - - I will never lie nor fawn,</line> 
<line>Nor flatter, to be rob'd in lawn.</line> 
<line>I too, can boast a certain rule</line> 
<line>Within the precincts of my school :</line> 
<line>Whatever faults I may pass by,</line>

<line>To seek the balmy sweets of rest.</line> 
<line>Syntax soon clos'd each weary eye,</line>

<line>While, like the ever-watchful snake,</line> 
<line>His sharp companion lay awake,</line> 
<line>Impatient to assail his prey ;</line> 
<line>When, soon as it was dawn of day,</line> 
<line>He gently seiz'd the fancied store ;</line>

<line>And caught the culprit at the gate :</line> 
<line>Against that gate his head he beat,</line> 
<line>Then kick'd him headlong to the street.</line>

<pb n="131" /> 

<line>The ostler, from his bed arose,</line> 
<line>In time to hear and see the blows.</line> 
<line>Says Syntax, " I'll not make a riot ;</line> 
<line>I've sav'd my notes, and I'll be quiet.</line> 
<line>The rascal, if I'm not mistaken,</line> 
<line>Will ask his legs to save his bacon :</line>

<line>Whatever forms the human lot,</line> 
<line>Whether in palace or in cot,</line> 
<line>In the calm track or frequent strife,</line> 
<line>Man leads his variegated life ;</line>

<line>Whether he labours thro' the day</line> 
<line>In Winter cold, or Summer's ray ;</line> 
<line>Or, in long nights of tort'ring pain,</line> 
<line>He strives to close his eyes in vain ;</line> 
<line>Comfort will on his lot attend</line> 
<line>If Virtue be his bosom friend.</line> 
<line>In youth, when Love's creative pow'r</line> 
<line>Forms the young Passion's roseate bow'r ;</line> 
<line>When, life matur'd, the eager game</line> 
<line>That hunts for wealth, or seeks for fame,</line>

<line>To seize the mind and fill the heart :</line>

<line>When age comes on, with stealing pace,</line>

<line>Turn'd from the portal, once his own ;</line>

<line>And curs'd once more the love of game :</line> 
<line>Then sought the lawn, for Nature fail'd,</line>

<line>Beneath an oak's wide-spreading shade</line> 
<line>His weary limbs he careless laid ;</line>

<line>LET Grandeur blush, and think how few</line> 
<line>Of all the many-colour'd crew,</line>
<line>The motley group of fools and knaves,</line>

<line>Syntax once more his beast bestrode ;</line>

</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Now Nature's beauties caught his eye,</line> 
<line>Array'd in gay simplicity ;</line> 
<line>And as he pass'd the road along,</line> 
<line>The blackbird's note, and thrush's song,</line> 
<line>With musical and native mirth,</line> 
<line>Seem'd to do homage to his worth.</line> 
<line>The vary'd landscape here combin'd</line> 
<line>To fascinate the eye and mind,</line> 
<line>To charm the gazer's ev'ry sense</line> 
<line>From the commanding eminence.</line> 
<line>Th' expanding plain, with plenty crown'd,</line> 
<line>Diffuses health and fragrance round ;</line> 
<line>While, on a lofty, craggy height,</line> 
<line>A castle rises to the sight,</line> 
<line>Which in its day of strength and pride,</line> 
<line>The arms of threat'ning foes defy'd.</line> 
<line>Beneath the mouldering abode</line>
<line>In mazy course a riv'let flow'd ;</line>

<line>Its silent stream refresh'd the vale.</line> 
<line>The vale the scatter'd hamlet cheer'd,</line> 
<line>And many a straw-roof 'd cot appear'd ;</line> 
<line>While smiling groups at ev'ry door</line> 
<line>Spoke grief a stranger to the poor.</line> 
<line>With pious thought, and eye serene,</line> 
<line>Syntax survey'd th' enchanting scene,</line>

<pb n="153" />
 
<line>Such are thy gifts, all gracious pow'r !</line>

<line>How oft we risk our health and ease,</line> 
<line>Thy best bequest, thy choicest treasure,</line> 
<line>For follies which we misname pleasure ;</line> 
<line>And slaves to vanity and art,</line> 
<line>Check the best feelings of the heart.</line>  
<line>How the scene charms the ravish'd eye !</line> 
<line>I cannot, will not, pass it by,"</line> 
<line>He said, - - and from his pocket took</line> 
<line>The pencil, and the sketching-book ;</line> 
<line>While Grizzle, in contented mood,</line> 
<line>Close by her busy master stood :</line> 
<line>When, clouds of dust proclaim'd th' approach</line> 
<line>Of something Syntax deem'd a coach.</line> 
<line>Four wheels in truth it had to boast,</line> 
<line>Altho' what it resembled most</line> 
<line>Were hard to say : - - suffice, this <i>tub</i></line> 
<line>Was built in London, where a club,</line> 
<line>Yclept <i>Four-horse,</i> is now the rage,</line> 
<line>And fam'd for whims in equipage.</line> 
<line>Dashers ! who once a month assemble ;</line> 
<line>Make creditors and coachmen tremble ;</line> 
<line>And, dress'd in colours vastly fine.</line> 
<line>Drive to some public-house to dine ;</line> 
<line>There game, and drink, and swear, and then - -</line>  
<line>Drive in disorder back again.</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Now Syntax, with some kind of fear,</line> 
<line>Beheld the vehicle draw near ;</line> 
<line>And, like her master, Grizzle too</line> 
<line>Was far from happy at the view ;</line>

<pb n="154" />
 
<line>For a long whip had caught her eye</line>
<line>Moving about most rapidly ;</line> 
<line>Though little thought the hapless nag,</line> 
<line>The joke which the exalted wag,</line>
<line>Who held the reins with skilful hand,</line> 
<line>Against both mare and master plann'd.</line> 
<line>But now the curious Doctor spy'd</line> 
<line>The emblem of Patrician pride ;</line> 
<line>Which on the panels of the coach</line> 
<line>Proclaim'd a noble Lord's approach :</line> 
<line>Nay, (for the facts will plainly prove it)</line> 
<line>It was a noble Lord who drove it ;</line> 
<line>For 'tis well known to men of rank</line> 
<line>That Lords will sometimes play a prank ;</line> 
<line>And thus indulge themselves in jokes</line> 
<line>As low as those of vulgar folks.</line> 
<line>But 'tis not easy to express</line> 
<line>The wild surprize, the deep distress,</line> 
<line>Which Syntax felt, when this same Lord</line> 
<line>Aim'd at his back the flaunting cord ;</line> 
<line>And when the whip, with skilful turn,</line> 
<line>Was well applied to Grizzle's stern ; - -</line> 
<line>That stern, enough to make one shudder,</line> 
<line>Which we all know, had lost its rudder : - -</line> 
<line>Her rage appear'd in either eye,</line> 
<line>And then she neigh'd indignantly.</line> 
<line>Such seem'd she as when erst she bore</line> 
<line>A trumpeter to fields of gore ;</line> 
<line>When, in the battle's heat, at large,</line> 
<line>She led whole squadrons to the charge ;</line> 
<line>While Syntax, as she scour'd the plain,</line> 
<line>Indulg'd the moralizing strain.</line> 
<line>" Can I, in this foul conduct scan</line> 
<line>The Peer, or well bred Gentleman ?</line>

<pb n="155" />
 
<line>Or rather must not Virtue frown</line> 
<line>On such a high-born, titled clown ?</line> 
<line>Thus, then, do Nobles play the fool ?</line> 
<line>A conduct which in my poor school,</line> 
<line>If 'mong my boys it dare appear ;</line> 
<line>If they should ape that monkey there ;</line> 
<line>They for their fun should pay full dearly ; - -</line> 
<line>I'd whip the blackguards most severely.</line> 
<line>But I'll not waste another word</line> 
<line>Upon this vulgar, booby Lord ;</line> 
<line>For I have something else to do, - -</line> 
<line>And Grizzle, what's become of you ?"</line> 
<line>A farmer's well-stor'd barn, hard by,</line> 
<line>Attracted her observing eye,</line>
<line>Where many a truss of fragrant hay</line> 
<line>Induc'd the prudent beast to stay.</line> 
<line>Meanwhile, her discontented master,</line> 
<line>Reflecting on the late disaster,</line> 
<line>Pac'd slowly on, brimful of care,</line> 
<line>And wonder'd who had got his mare.</line> 
<line>Indeed, he fear'd she might be found</line> 
<line>Within the precincts of a pound ;</line> 
<line>But soon his quadruped he saw,</line> 
<line>Up to her girths in hay and straw :</line> 
<line>While he, who own'd the neighb'ring farm,</line> 
<line>Prepar'd to raise his weighty arm ;</line> 
<line>And, having just observ'd the theft,</line> 
<line>Brandish'd a horsewhip right and left,</line> 
<line>(Alas ! it cannot be deny'd,)</line> 
<line>To lay about on Grizzle's hide.</line> 
<line>Syntax beheld the harsh intent :</line> 
<line>" Forbear," he cried, " the punishment !</line> 
<line>Why make her feel the chast'ning thong ?</line> 
<line>She knows not she is doing wrong.</line>

<pb n="156" /> 

<line>Forgive my warmth, but truly, Sir,</line> 
<line>This suits not with the character</line> 
<line>Of one who treads on British ground, - -</line> 
<line>A land for justice so renown'd :</line> 
<line>I'll pay for all the straw that's wasted,</line> 
<line>And all the hay that she has tasted ;</line> 
<line>Your courtesy I now invoke,</line> 
<line>So name the cost, and spare the stroke."</line> 
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>The Farmer paus'd - - as by a charm - -</line> 
<line>And dropp'd at once th' uplifted arm : - -</line>
<line>" Forgive me, Sir, for what," he cried,</line> 
<line>" Cannot indeed be justified :</line> 
<line>But for my haste, I'll make amends ;</line> 
<line>And let us now, good Sir, be friends.</line> 
<line>That is my house : - - you'll enter there,</line> 
<line>And, Thomas, take the Doctor's mare.</line> 
<line>Come, rev'rend Sir, I'll lead the way :"</line> 
<line>The Doctor did not disobey,</line> 
<line>And soon was met with welcome glee,</line> 
<line>By all the Farmer's family.</line> 
<line>At length some business of the day</line> 
<line>Summon'd the honest host away ;</line> 
<line>So Syntax thought he'd look about,</line> 
<line>To find some curious object out ;</line> 
<line>When, lo ! a dairy met his view,</line> 
<line>Where, full of cream, in order due,</line> 
<line>The pans, the bowls, the jugs were plac'd,</line> 
<line>Which tempted the Divine to taste ;</line> 
<line>But he found something better there : - -</line> 
<line>A village damsel young and fair</line> 
<line>Attracted his admiring eye ;</line> 
<line>Who, as he enter'd, heav'd a sigh.</line>

<pb n="157" /> 
 
<line>Now Syntax, as we all must know,</line> 
<line>Ne'er heard a sigh or tale of woe,</line> 
<line>But instant wish'd to bring relief - -</line> 
<line>To dry the tear and soothe the grief.</line> 
<line>" Come here, sweet girl," he softly said ;</line> 
<line>" Tell me your cares - - nor be afraid :</line> 
<line>Come here, and seat you by my side ;</line> 
<line>You'll find in me a friendly guide.</line> 
<line>Relate your sorrows, - - tell the truth ;</line> 
<line>What is it ? does some perjur'd youth</line> 
<line>Unfaithful to his promise prove,</line> 
<line>Nor make the fond return of love ?</line>

<line>Again, I say, your grief impart ;</line>

<line>But lo ! the Farmer, at the gate,</line> 
<line>Proclaim'd aloud, the hour of eight ;</line>

<pb n="162" />
 
<line>And Syntax now in haste descends.</line> 
<line>To join his kind, expecting friends.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>"Well," said his host, " another day</line> 
<line>I trust your Reverence will stay."</line> 
<line>" I thank you for the offer made,</line> 
<line>But that can't be," the Doctor said ;</line> 
<line>" I have a weary way to go,</line> 
<line>And much to see, and more to know ;</line> 
<line>Indeed so far I've got so roam,</line> 
<line>A fortnight scarce will take me home ;</line> 
<line>And, thanking you for all your care,</line> 
<line>I must beg leave to seek my mare."</line> 
<line>Grizzle was quickly to be found ;</line> 
<line>And, as the good folks stood around,</line> 
<line>Syntax thought proper to discourse</line> 
<line>Upon the virtues of his horse ;</line> 
<line>Nor did he fail at large to tell</line> 
<line>That she had serv'd him passing well ;</line> 
<line>While he forgot not to bewail</line> 
<line>Her loss of ears, and loss of tail :</line> 
<line>For tho' among the passing folk,</line> 
<line>His beast created many a joke ;</line> 
<line>And tho' the foul and sad disaster</line> 
<line>Oft forc'd a laugh against the master ;</line> 
<line>They should not part while he was able</line>
<line>To keep himself and keep a stable ;</line> 
<line>Nay, to the last he'd cut and carve,</line>
<line>That his poor Grizzle might not starve.</line> 
<line>Thus, as her hist'ry he recounted,</line> 
<line>Into the saddle up he mounted ;</line> 
<line>And there for some time having sat,</line> 
<line>He clos'd at length, his farewell chat.</line> 
<line>He thought it best t' avoid caressing ;</line> 
<line>So gave no kiss, but gave his blessing.</line>

<line> - - On home, on book, on fame, intent,</line> 
<line>The Doctor ponder'd as he went :</line> 
<line>At night he look'd his papers o'er,</line> 
<line>And added to the learned store :</line> 
<line>But the next morn, another scene,</line> 
<line>The vast expanse of liquid green - -</line>
<line>The ocean's self - - broke on his eye,</line> 
<line>In inexpressive majesty.</line> 
<line>There, as he look'd, full many a sail</line> 
<line>Gave its white canvass to the gale ;</line> 
<line>And many a freighted vessel bore</line> 
<line>Its treasure to the British shore :</line> 
<line>When, as he trac'd the winding coast,</line> 
<line>In praise and admiration lost,</line>
<line>Up-rising in the distant view,</line>
<line>Half-seen thro' the ethereal blue,</line> 
<line>A city's stately form appear'd ;</line> 
<line>Upon the shore the mass was rear'd,</line> 
<line>With glist'ning spires, while below</line> 
<line>Masts like a forest seem'd to grow.</line> 
<line>'Twas Liverpool, that splendid mart,</line> 
<line>Imperial London's counterpart,</line> 
<line>Where wand'ring Mersey's rapid streams</line> 
<line>Rival the honours of the Thames ;</line> 
<line>And bear, on each returning tide,</line> 
<line>Whate'er by commerce is supply'd :</line> 
<line>Whate'er the winds can hurry o'er</line> 
<line>From ev'ry clime and distant shore.</line> 
<line>Thus Syntax pac'd along the strand,</line> 
<line>Thro' this fine scene of sea and land.</line> 
<line>But nearer now the town appears,</line> 
<line>The hum of men salutes his ears ;</line> 
<line>And soon amid the noisy din</line> 
<line>He found the comforts of an Inn.</line>

<pb n="164" />
 
<line>He eat, he drank, his pipe he smok'd,</line> 
<line>And with the Landlord quaintly jok'd ;</line> 
<line>But, e'er he slept, he pass'd an hour</line> 
<line>In adding something to his Tour ;</line> 
<line>Then sought his couch, in hopes the morn</line> 
<line>Would with new thoughts the page adorn.</line> 
<line>The morning came - - he sallied out</line> 
<line>To breathe the air, and look about.</line> 
<line>Where'er he turn'd, his ev'ry sense</line> 
<line>Grasp'd one vast scene of opulence :</line> 
<line>In all he saw there was display'd</line> 
<line>The proud magnificence of trade.</line>

<line>Syntax an humble scholar bred,</line> 
<line>With nought but learning in his head ;</line> 
<line>Profound, indeed, in classic art,</line> 
<line>And goodness reigning in his heart ;</line> 
<line>Yet forty pounds a year was all</line> 
<line>He could his fix'd revenue call ;</line> 
<line>For which, on ev'ry Sabbath-day,</line> 
<line>He went eight miles to preach and pray.</line> 
<line>His school too, brought but little gains,</line> 
<line>And scarce repaid him for his pains :</line> 
<line>It gave, 'tis true, to drink and eat ;</line> 
<line>It furnish'd him with bread and meat,</line> 
<line>And kept the wolf without the door ;</line> 
<line>But Syntax still was very poor.</line> 
<line>His wife, indeed, had got the art,</line> 
<line>To keep herself a little smart ;</line> 
<line>Yet he, good man, was always seen</line> 
<line>With scanty coat, and figure mean :</line> 
<line>But still he never threw aside</line> 
<line>The pedant's air - - the pedant's pride.</line> 
<line>Thus, thro' the streets of this rich place,</line> 
<line>He strutted with his usual grace :</line>

<pb n="165" /> 

<line>And thus he walk'd about the town,</line> 
<line>As if its wealth had been his own :</line> 
<line>But of his wealth he could not vapour - -</line> 
<line>Twelve guineas, and a piece of paper</line> 
<line>(The present of a noble Lord),</line> 
<line>Was all his pockets did afford :</line> 
<line>Though still the lining of his coat</line> 
<line>Secreted 'Squire Hearty's note.</line> 
<line>And now he thought 'twould not be rash</line> 
<line>To turn the paper into cash.</line> 
<line>Thus, at his breakfast, while he sat,</line> 
<line>And social join'd the common chat,</line> 
<line>He took occasion to inquire</line> 
<line>Who would comply with his desire :</line> 
<line>Who would his anxious wish fulfil,</line> 
<line>And give him money for his bill.</line> 
<line>An arch young sprig, a banker's clerk,</line> 
<line>Resolv'd to hoax the rev'rend spark,</line> 
<line>And counsell'd him to take a range</line> 
<line>Among the Merchants on the 'Change.</line> 
<line>" Some one, perhaps, may want to send</line> 
<line>A payment to a London friend ;</line> 
<line>He'll in your wishes gladly join,</line> 
<line>And take the draft and pay the coin."</line>

<line>The Barber now the Doctor shear'd,</line> 
<line>And soon whipp'd off his three-days' beard,</line> 
<line>His wig, which had not felt a comb,</line>  
<line>Not once since he had quitted home,</line> 
<line>Was destin'd now to friz and twirl</line> 
<line>To be tormented into curl :</line> 
<line>His coat, which long had ta'en the rust,</line> 
<line>Was soon depriv'd of all the dust :</line> 
<line>His gaiters too, were fresh japann'd ;</line> 
<line>Such were the Doctor's stern command :</line>

<pb n="166" />
 
<line>And now with spirits fresh and gay,</line> 
<line>To the Exchange he took his way,</line> 
<line>To try in this commercial town</line> 
<line>A little commerce of his own.</line> 
<line>Th' Exchange soon met his wond'ring sight ;</line>
<line>The structure fill'd him with delight.</line> 
<line>" Such are the fruits of trading knowledge !</line>
<line>Learning," he cried, " builds no such college !</line> 
<line>Indeed, I entertain a notion,</line> 
<line>(I speak the thought with true devotion,)</line> 
<line>Tho' we in Holy Scripture read</line> 
<line>That Tyre and Sidon did exceed</line> 
<line>In wealth, the cities of the world,</line>
