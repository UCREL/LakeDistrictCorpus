<p>To <person met="U">Dr. Thomas Wharton</person></p>
  <!--Thomas Gray's letter, dated 30 September 1769, actually covers the days 30 September and 1 October 1769. In order to facilitate the GIS mapping of Gray's account of his tour of the Lake District, it is necessary to impose a more logical structure on his epistolary text. See Zoe Bolton's note for more on the complex textual history of Thomas Gray's account of his visit to the Lake District in October 1769, including Dr Thomas Wharton's role as addressee. In a letter to his Cambridge friend, James Brown, dated 10 October 1769 and sent from Lancaster, Gray provides a brief summary of his tour of the Lakes: 'I set out on the 29th September, with poor Doctor Wharton, and lay at Brough, but he was seized with a fit of the asthma the same night, and obliged in the morning to return home. I went by Penrith to Keswick, and passed six days there lap'd in Elysium; then came slowly by Ambleside to Kendal, and this day arrived here [Lancaster]. I am now projecting to strike across the hills into Yorkshire, by Settle, and so get to Mason's; then, after a few days, I shall move gently towards Cambridge.' As Bolton explains in her textual note, Gray's 'Journal' begins life as a series of letters to his friend, Wharton, who was unable to take part in the excursion around the Lakes.

<p> Oct: I.

<p>I descended <i><pl_name visited="Y">Dunmallert</pl_name></i> again by a side avenue, that was only not perpendicular, &amp; came to <i><pl_name visited="Y">Barton-bridge</pl_name></i><!--Barton Bridge - in his letter to Wharton Gray italicises Barton but not Bridge--> over the <i><pl_name visited="Y">Eeman</pl_name></i> <!--River Eamont-->, then walking thro' a path in the wood <!--<pl_name visited="Y">??</pl_name>--> round the bottom of the hill came forth, where the <i><pl_name visited="Y">Eeman</pl_name></i><!--River Eamont--> issues<!--modernisation of Gray's spelling--> out of the lake, &amp; continued my way along it's western shore close to the water<!--<pl_name visited="Y">Ullswater [western shore]</pl_name>-->, &amp; generally on a level with it.

<p>Dined by two o'clock at the Queen's Head <!--Queen's Head, Keswick-->, &amp; then straggled out alone to the <i>Parsonage</i>, fell down on my back across <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> a dirty lane with my glass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> open in one hand, but broke only my knuckles: stay'd nevertheless<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->, &amp; saw the sun set in all its glory.</p>




<p>Oct: 3.

<p>Behind you are the magnificent heights of <i><pl_name visited="N">Walla</pl_name></i>-crag<!--Walla Crag - Gray italicises Walla but not Crag-->; opposite lie the thick hanging woods of <person met="N">Lord Egremont</person><!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling of 'Lord'.-->, &amp; <i><pl_name visited="N">Newland</pl_name></i>-valley<!--Newlands Valley - Gray italicises Newland but not Valley--> with green &amp; smiling fields embosom'd in the dark cliffs; to the left the jaws of <i><pl_name visited="N">Borodale</pl_name></i><!--Jaws of Borrowdale-->, with that turbulent Chaos of mountain behind mountain roll'd in confusion; beneath you, &amp; stretching far away to the right, the shining purity of the <i>Lake</i><!--<pl_name visited="N">Derwent Water</pl_name>-->, just ruffled by the breeze enough to shew it is alive, reflecting rocks, woods, fields, &amp; inverted tops of mountains, with the white buildings of <i><pl_name visited="N">Keswick</pl_name></i>, <i><pl_name visited="N">Crosthwait</pl_name></i>-church<!--Crosthwaite Church - Gray italicises Crosthwait but not Church-->, &amp; <i><pl_name visited="N">Skiddaw</pl_name></i> for a back-ground at a distance. oh <person met="N">Doctor</person>! I never wish'd more for you; &amp; pray think, how the glass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> played its part in such a spot, which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> is called <i><pl_name visited="Y">Carf-close-reeds</pl_name></i><!--Calfclose Bay?-->: I chuse to set down these barbarous names, that any body may enquire on the place, &amp; easily find the particular station, that I mean.</p>

<p>This scene continues to <i><pl_name visited="U">Barrow-gate</pl_name></i>, &amp; a little farther, passing<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> a brook called <i><pl_name visited="Y">Barrow-beck</pl_name></i>, we enter'd <i><pl_name visited="Y">Borodale</pl_name></i><!--Borrowdale-->. the crags, named <i><pl_name visited="N">Lodoor-banks</pl_name></i> now begin to impend terribly over your way; &amp; more terribly, when you hear, that three years since an immense mass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> of rock tumbled at once from the brow, &amp; bar'd all access <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> to the dale<!--<pl_name visited="Y">Borrowdale</pl_name>--> (for this is the only road) till they could work their way thro' it. luckily no one was passing<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> at the time of this fall; but down the side of the mountain &amp; far into the lake<!--<pl_name visited="N">Derwent Water</pl_name>--> lie dispersed the huge fragments of this ruin in all shapes &amp; in all directions.</p>

<p>Something farther we turn'd aside into a coppice<!--<pl_name visited="Y">Screes Coppice?</pl_name>-->, ascending a little in front of <i><pl_name visited="Y">Lodoor</pl_name></i> water-fall<!--Lodore Falls - Gray only italicises "Lodoor"-->. the height appears to be about 200 feet, the quantity of water not great, tho' (these three days excepted) it had rain'd daily in the hills for near two months before: but then the stream was nobly broken, leaping from rock to rock, &amp; foaming with fury. on one side a towering crag<!--<pl_name visited="N">??</pl_name>-->, that spired up to equal, if not overtop, the neighbouring cliffs (this lay all in shade &amp; darkness<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> on the other hand a rounder broader projecting hill<!--<pl_name visited="N">??</pl_name>--> shag'd with wood &amp; illumined by the sun, which <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> glanced sideways on the upper part of the cataract. the force of the water wearing a deep channel in the ground hurries away to join the lake<!--<pl_name visited="N">Derwent Water</pl_name>-->. we descended again, &amp; passed<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> the stream <!--<pl_name visited="Y">Watendlath Beck?</pl_name>--> over a rude bridge, soon after we came under <i><pl_name visited="N">Gowder-crag</pl_name></i>, a hill more formidable to the eye &amp; to the apprehension than that of <i><pl_name visited="N">Lodoor</pl_name></i><!--Lodore-->; the rocks atop, deep-cloven perpendicularly by the rains, hanging loose &amp; nodding forwards, seem just starting from their base in shivers: the whole way down &amp; the road on both sides is strew'd with piles of the fragments strangely thrown across<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> each other &amp; of a dreadful bulk. the place reminds one of those passes<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> in the <pl_name visited="N">Alps</pl_name>, where the Guides tell you to move on with speed, &amp; say nothing, lest the agitation of the air should loosen the snows above, &amp; bring down a mass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> that would overwhelm a caravan. I took their<!--<person met="Y">guide(s)</person>--> counsel here and hasten'd on in silence.</p>

<p>Oct: 3. The hills here are cloth'd all up their steep sides with oak, ash, birch, holly &amp;c: some of it has been cut 40 years ago, some within these 8 years, yet all is sprung again green, flourishing, &amp; tall for its age, in a place where no soil appears but the staring rock, &amp; where a man could scarce stand upright.</p>

<p>Met a civil young <person met="Y">Farmer</person> overseeing his reapers (for it is oat-harvest here) who conducted us to a neat white house<!--<pl_name visited="Y">??</pl_name>--> in the village of <pl_name visited="Y">Grange</pl_name>, which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> is built on a rising ground in the midst of a valley. round it the mountains form an aweful ampitheatre, &amp; thro' it obliquely runs the <pl_name visited="Y">Darwent</pl_name><!--River Derwent--> clear as glass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->, &amp; shewing under it's bridge every trout that passes<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->. beside the village<!--<pl_name visited="Y">Grange</pl_name>--> rises a round eminence of rock cover'd entirely with old trees<!--<pl_name visited="N">Holmcrag Wood?</pl_name>-->, &amp; over that more proudly towers <i><pl_name visited="N">Castle-crag</pl_name></i>, invested also with wood on its sides, &amp; bearing on its naked top some traces of a fort said to be Roman.</p>

<p>By the side of this hill<!--<pl_name visited="N">Castle Crag</pl_name>-->, the valley <!--<pl_name visited="Y">Borrowdale</pl_name>-->turns to the left &amp; contracts its dimensions, till there is hardly any road but the rocky bed of the river<!--<pl_name visited="Y">River Derwent</pl_name>-->. the wood of the mountains increases &amp; their summits grow loftier to the eye, &amp; of more fantastic forms: among them appear <i><pl_name visited="N">Eagle's-cliff</pl_name></i>, <i><pl_name visited="N">Dove's-nest</pl_name></i>, <i><pl_name visited="N">Whitedale-pike</pl_name></i>, &amp;c: celebrated names in the annals of <pl_name visited="N">Keswick</pl_name>. the dale <!--<pl_name visited="Y">Borrowdale</pl_name>-->opens about four miles higher till you come to <i><pl_name visited="N">Sea-Whaite</pl_name></i><!--Seathwaite--> (where lies the way mounting the hills to the right, that leads to the <i>Wadd-mines</i>) all farther access<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> is here barr'd to prying Mortals, only there is a little path winding over the Fells<!--<pl_name visited="N">Sty Head Pass?</pl_name>-->, &amp; for some weeks in the year passable <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> to the Dale's-men; but the Mountains know well, that these innocent people will not reveal the mysteries of their ancient kingdom, the reign of Chaos &amp; old Night. only I learn'd, that this dreadful road dividing again leads one branch to <i><pl_name visited="N">Ravenglas</pl_name></i><!--Ravenglass-->, &amp; the other to <i><pl_name visited="N">Hawkshead</pl_name></i>.</p>

<p>For me I went no farther than the <person met="Y">Farmer's</person> (better than 4m: from Keswick) at <i><pl_name visited="Y">Grange</pl_name></i>: his <person met="Y">Mother</person> &amp; he brought us butter, that Siserah would have jump'd at, tho' not in a lordly dish<!--Allusion to the Book of Judges.-->, bowls of milk, thin oaten-cakes, &amp; ale; &amp; we had carried a cold tongue thither with us. our <person met="Y">Farmer</person> was himself the Man, that last year plundered the Eagle's eirie: all the dale are up in arms on such an occasion, for they lose abundance of lambs yearly, not to mention hares, partridge, grous, &amp;c: he was let down from the cliff in ropes to the shelf of rock, on which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->the nest was built, the people above shouting &amp; hollowing to fright the old birds, which <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->flew screaming round, but did not dare to attack him. he brought off the eaglet (for there is rarely more than one) &amp; an addle egg. the nest was roundish &amp; more than a yard over, made of twigs twisted together. seldom a year passes<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->but they take the brood or eggs, &amp; sometimes they shoot one, sometimes the other Parent, but the surviver has always found a mate (probably in Ireland) &amp; they breed near the old place. by his description I learn, that this species is the <i>Erne</i> (the Vultur <i>Albicilla</i> of Linnaeus in his last edition, but in yours <i>Falco Albicilla</i>) so consult <person met="N">Pennant</person> about it.</p>

<p>Walk'd leisurely home<!--<pl_name visited="Y">Keswick</pl_name>--> the way we came, but saw a new landscape: the features indeed were the same in part, but many new ones were disclosed by the mid-day Sun, &amp; the tints were entirely changed. take notice this was the best or perhaps the one day for going up <pl_name visited="N">Skiddaw</pl_name>, but I thought it better employ'd: it was perfectly serene, &amp; hot as midsummer.</p>

<p>In the evening walk'd alone down to the Lake <!--<pl_name visited="Y">Derwent Water</pl_name>-->by the side of <i><pl_name visited="N">Crow-Park</pl_name></i> after sunset &amp; saw the solemn colouring of night draw on, the last gleam of sunshine fading away on the hill-tops, the deep serene of the waters, &amp; the long shadows of the mountains thrown across<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->them, till they nearly touch'd the hithermost shore. at distance heard the murmur of many waterfalls not audible in the day-time. wish'd for the Moon, but she was <i>dark to me &amp; silent, hid in her vacant interlunar cave.</i></p>



<p>Oct: 4. Wd E:, clouds &amp; sunshine, &amp; in the course of the day a few drops of rain. Walk'd to <i><pl_name visited="Y">Crow-park</pl_name></i>, now a rough pasture once a glade of ancient oaks, whose large roots still remain on the ground, but nothing has sprung from them. if one single tree had remain'd, this would have been an unparallel'd spot, &amp; <person met="N">Smith</person> judged right, when he took his print of the Lake<!--<pl_name visited="Y">Derwent Water</pl_name>-->hence, for it is a gentle eminence, not too high, on the very margin of the water &amp; commanding it from end to end, looking full into the <i>gorge of <pl_name visited="N">Borodale</pl_name></i><!--Borrowdale-->.

<p>From hence I got to the <i>Parsonage</i><!--<pl_name visited="Y">Crosthwaite Grange</pl_name>--> a little before Sunset, &amp; saw in my glass <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->a picture, that if I could transmitt to you, &amp; fix it in all the softness <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->of its living colours, would fairly sell for a thousand pounds. this is the sweetest scene I can yet discover in point of pastoral beauty. the rest are in a sublimer style.</p>

<p><!--Gray's journal entry for 10 October 1769 raises questions about the way in which we define the Lake District. Although the City of Lancaster lies well beyond the boundaries of the Lake District now imposed by the National Park Authority, there is a convincing argument that the town represented the important starting-point for Picturesque tours of the region: visitors often spent the night at Lancaster before embarking on the treacherous walk across the shifting sands of Morecambe Bay. As a result, I have included Gray's journal entries covering his time in Lancaster.

<p><!--As with the entry for 10 October 1769, Gray is located in a landscape well beyond the modern boundaries of the Lake District as defined by the National Park Authority. But Poutlon, the coastal village in which he spends the day, can be seen to be part of a wider model of 'Greater Lakeland', to borrow a term used by the twentieth-century poet and topographer, Norman Nicholson. As William Roberts points out, the towns of 'Morecambe and Heysham did not exist at that time: they came later with the development of an Irish ferry terminal and the coming of the railway in the 1840s-->Oct: 11. Wind<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> S:W: clouds &amp; sun. warm &amp; a fine dappled sky. cross'd<!--Partial modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> the river<!--<pl_name visited="Y">River Lune</pl_name>--> &amp; walk'd over a peninsula<!--<pl_name visited="Y">??</pl_name>--> 3 miles to the village of <i><pl_name visited="Y">Pooton</pl_name></i><!--Poulton?--> which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> stands on the beach. an old <person met="Y">Fisherman</person> mending his nets (while I enquired about the danger of passing<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> those sands<!--<pl_name visited="N">Lancaster Sands</pl_name>-->) told me in his dialect a moving story, how a brother of the trade, a <person met="N"><i>Cockler</i></person> (as he styled him) driving a little cart with two daughters (women grown) in it, &amp; his Wife on horseback following, set out one day to pass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> the 7 mile sands, as they had frequently been used to do, for nobody in the village knew them better than the old Man did. when they were about haf way over, a thick fog rose, &amp; as they advanced, they found the water much deeper than they expected. the old man was puzzled, he stop'd, &amp; said he would go a little way to find some mark he was acquainted with. they staid a little while for him, but in vain. they call'd aloud, but no reply. at last the young women press'd<!--Partial modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> their mother to think, where they were, &amp; go on. she would not leave the place, she wander'd about forlon &amp; amazed, she would not quit her horse, &amp; get into the cart with them. they determined after much time wasted to turn back, &amp; give themselves up to the guidance of their horses. the old Woman was soon wash'd off and perish'd. the poor Girls clung close to their cart, &amp; the horse sometimes wading &amp; sometimes swimming brought them back to land alive, but senseless<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> with terror &amp; distress<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> &amp; unable for many days to give an account of themselves. the bodies of their parents were found soon after; that of the Father a vert few paces distant from the spot, where he had left them.</p>

<p>In the afternoon wander'd about the town<!--<pl_name visited="Y">Lancaster</pl_name>--> &amp; by the key<!--<pl_name visited="Y">Lancaster Quay</pl_name>--> till it grew dark. a little rain fell.

<!--In his 2001 edition of 'Thomas Gray's Journal of his Visit to the Lake District in October 1769', William Roberts covers the next three days of Gray's tour of northern England: days in which, according to Roberts's own titles, Gray journeys from 'Lancaster to Settle'; visits 'Gordale Scar'; and, finally, travels from 'Settle to Otley'. Within the context of the current mapping project, the primary interest is Gray's account of his time spent travelling around the Lake District: the old counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and north Lancashire. As a result, Gray's excursion into north Yorkshire lies beyond the spatial parameters necessarily imposed - perhaps artificially - by the present project. --></p>
