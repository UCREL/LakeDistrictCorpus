<p>The country between <i>Moffat</i> and <i>Lockerby</i> is very good, a mixture of downs and corn-land, with a few &#383;mall woods: the country grows quite flat and very unplea&#383;ant. Cro&#383;s a fmall river called the <i>Sark</i>, which divides the two kingdoms, and enter CUMBERLAND.</p>
<p>About three miles farther cro&#383;s the <i>E&#383;k</i> over a hand&#383;ome &#383;tone-bridge, and lie at the &#383;mall village of <i>Longtown</i>. The country is very rich in corn, but quite bare of trees, and very flat. Near this village, at <i>Netherby</i> are the ruins of a <i>Roman</i> &#383;ta-,

tion, where &#383;tatues, weapons and coins are often dug up.</p>
<p>Cro&#383;s the <i>Eden</i> to <i>Carli&#383;le</i> a plea&#383;ant city, &#383;urrounded with walls, like <i>Che&#383;ter</i>, but they are very dirty, and kept in very bad repair. The ca&#383;tle is antient, but makes a good appearance at a di&#383;tance: the view from it is fine, of rich meadows, at this time covered with thou&#383;ands of cattle, it being fair-day. The <i>Eden</i> here forms two branches, and infulates the ground; over one is a bridge of four, over the other one of nine arches. There is be&#383;ides a pro&#383;pect of a rich country, and a di&#383;tant view of <i>Cold-fells</i>, <i>Cro&#383;s-fells</i>, <i>Skiddaw</i>, and other mountains.</p>
<p>The cathedral<ptr target="n1"/> is very imperfect, Cromwell having pulled down part to build barracks with the materials. There remains &#383;ome portion that was built in the <i>Saxon</i> times, with very ma&#383;&#383;y pillars and round arches. The re&#383;t is more modern, &#383;aid to have been built in the reign of <i>Edward</i> III. who had in one part an apartment to lodge in. The arches in this latter building are &#383;harp-pointed: the ca&#383;t window remarkably fine.</p>
<p>The manufactures of <i>Carli&#383;le</i> are chiefly of printed linnens, for which near 3000l. <i>per ann</i>. is paid in duties. It is al&#383;o noted for a great manufacture of whips, which employs numbers of children.</p>
<p>Salmons appear in the <i>Eden</i> in numbers &#383;o early as the months of <i>December</i> and <i>January</i>; and the <i>London</i> and even <i>Newca&#383;tle</i> markets, are &#383;upplied with early fi&#383;h from this river: but it is remarkable,
<pb n="218"/>
that they do not vi&#383;it the <i>E&#383;k</i> in any quantity till <i>April</i>, notwith&#383;tanding the mouths of both the&#383;e waters are at a &#383;mall di&#383;tance from each other. I omitted in its proper place an account of the <i>Newca&#383;tle</i> fi&#383;hery, therefore in&#383;ert here the little I could collect relating to it: the fi&#383;h &#383;eldom appear in the Tyne till February: there are about 24 fi&#383;heries on the river, be&#383;ides a very con&#383;iderable were, and the whole annual capture amounts to about 36,000 fi&#383;h. I was informed that once the fi&#383;h were brought from <i>Berwick</i> and cured at <i>Newca&#383;tle</i>; but at pre&#383;ent, notwith&#383;tanding all goes under the name of <i>Newcaf&#383;tle</i> Salmon, very little is taken there, in companion of what is caught in the <i>Tweed</i>.</p>
<note id="n1"> Begun by <i>Walter</i>, deputy of the&#383;e parts, under <i>William Rufus</i>; but the new choir was not founded till about 1354.</note>
<p>The country near <i>Carli&#383;le</i> con&#383;i&#383;ts of &#383;mall enclo&#383;ures; but a little farther on, towards <i>Penrith</i>, changes into coar&#383;e downs. On the ea&#383;t, at a di&#383;tance, are ridges of high hills running parallel to the road, with a good inclo&#383;ed country in the intervening &#383;pace. Above <i>Penrith</i> is a rich inclo&#383;ed tract, mixed with hedge-row trees and woods. On the &#383;outh-we&#383;t, a pro&#383;pect of high and craggy mountains. After I left <i>Lockerby</i>, Nature, as if exhau&#383;ted with her labors in the lofty hills of <i>Scotland</i>, &#383;eemed to have lain down and repo&#383;ed her&#383;elf for a con&#383;iderable &#383;pace; but here began to ri&#383;e again with all the &#383;ublimity of <i>alpine</i> maje&#383;ty.</p>
<p>PENRITH is an antient town, &#383;eated at the foot of a hill: is a great thoroughfare for travellers; but has little other trade, except a &#383;mall one of checks. The church is very neat, the gallery &#383;upported by large columns, each formed of a &#383;ingle &#383;tone. In the church-yard is a monument of great

<pb n="219"/>
antiquity, con&#383;i&#383;ting of two &#383;tone pillars eleven feet &#383;ix inches high, and five in circumference in the lower part, which is rounded; the upper is &#383;quare, and tapers to a point: in the &#383;quare part is &#383;ome fret-work, and the relievo of a cro&#383;s. Both the&#383;e &#383;tones are morti&#383;ed at their lower part into a round one: they are about fifteen feet a&#383;under; the &#383;pace between them is inclo&#383;ed on each &#383;ide with two very large but thin &#383;emicircular &#383;tones, &#383;o that there is left a walk between pillar and pillar of two feet in breadth. Two of the&#383;e le&#383;&#383;er &#383;tones are plain, the other two have certain figures at pre&#383;ent &#383;carce intelligible.</p>
<p>Cro&#383;s the <i>Emot</i>, a &#383;mall river, and &#383;oon after the <i>Lowther</i>, over <i>Yeoman&#8217;s</i> Bridge, near which I enter</p>
<p>WESTMORLAND. About four miles farther cro&#383;s <i>Clifton</i> Moor, where the Rebels made a &#383;hort &#383;tand in 1745, and &#383;acrificed a few men to &#383;ave the re&#383;t of their army. Pa&#383;s over <i>Shap</i> Fells, more black, dreary, and melancholy, than any of the Highland hills, being not only very barren but de&#383;titute of every picture&#383;que beauty. This barren &#383;cene continued till within a &#383;mall diftance of</p>
<p>KENDAL, a large town on the river <i>Kent</i>, in a rich and beautifull vale, well cultivated, and prettily wooded. Here is a very great trade in knit wor&#383;ted-&#383;tockings, &#383;ome lin&#383;ies, and a coar&#383;e &#383;ort of cloth, called cottons, for the <i>Guinea</i> trade.</p>
<p>Near <i>Burton</i> enter LANCASHIRE. Reach its capital, <i>Lanca&#383;ter</i>, a large and well-built town, &#383;eated on the <i>Lune</i>, a river navigable for &#383;hips of 250 tuns as high as the bridge. The cu&#383;tom-hou&#383;e is a &#383;mall but mo&#383;t elegant building, with a portico

<pb n="220"/>
&#383;upported by four ionic pillars, ona beautifull plain pediment. There is a double &#383;light of &#383;teps, a ru&#383;tic &#383;urba&#383;e and coins; a work that does much redit to Mr. <i>Gillar</i>, the architect, an inhabitant of this town.</p>
<p>The church is &#383;eated on an eminence, and commands an exten&#383;ive but not plea&#383;ing view. The ca&#383;tle is entire, the courts of ju&#383;tice are held in it;  and is al&#383;o the county jail. The front is very hand&#383;ome, con&#383;i&#383;ts of two large angular towers, with a hand&#383;ome gateway between.</p>
<p>Ha&#383;tened through <i>Preston</i>, <i>Wiggan</i>, <i>Warrington</i>, and <i>Chester</i>, and fini&#383;hed my journey with a rapture of which no fond parent can be ignorant, that of being again re&#383;tored to two innocent prattlers after an ab&#383;ence eqully regretted by all parties.</p>
