<gap desc="Line"/>
<p>
ANY one acquainted with the mo&#8747;t popular dramas of the pre&#8747;ent day will not accu&#8747;e an author of much vanity, in thinking it no very difficult ta&#8747;k to plea&#8747;e the public in writing for the &#8747;tage.
</p>
<p>
Impre&#8747;&#8747;ed with this idea, when the Author of the following drama had an offer made him by a friend of the Deputy Manager of Covent Garden Theatre to pre&#8747;ent any piece, and in&#8747;ure its being, at lea&#8747;t, read by him (for pieces are &#8747;ometimes refu&#8747;ed without being read), he immediately &#8747;et about it; thinking he &#8747;hould be well repaid, if, for a few weeks trouble, he could put a few hundred pounds into his pocket; and that the lo&#8747;s would not be very great if un&#8747;ucce&#8747;sful.
</p>
<pb n="viii"/>
<p>To produce a laughable piece, and give the mu&#8747;ical compo&#8747;er and &#8747;cene painter an opportunity of di&#8747;playing their talents, was the object therefore in writing the following &#8747;cenes, rather than an attempt at writing a regular drama. Yet the Author, in &#8747;triving to plea&#8747;e, did not &#8747;o far forget his duty as a morali&#8747;t, as to &#8747;acrifice morality to mirth, and good &#8747;en&#8747;e to &#8747;cenery; and while he attempted to amu&#8747;e, he wi&#8747;hed to expo&#8747;e and lend his feeble aid to correct &#8747;ome of the follies of the age. He would have thought it a reflection upon the public to have exceeded the bounds of probability for effect, at lea&#8747;t of &#8747;uch probability as the pre&#8747;cription of the &#8747;tage allows: he would not have introduced an Otaheitean at the Lord Trea&#8747;urer Burleigh's, nor have gone &#8747;o far as to "make his heroine blue."
</p>
<p>
He had flattered himself into the per&#8747;ua&#8747;ion, that the character of Veronica was new to the &#8747;tage; and, in able hands, would produce a very laughable effect: it was written purpo&#8747;ely for Mrs. Mattocks; and, if the Author is any judge of the abilities of others, Mrs. Mattocks is the
<pb n="ix"/>
only per&#8747;on who could have performed it. In her line &#8747;he is unrivalled; and in her hands Veronica would have received a thou&#8747;and touches, which the pen of an author could never &#8747;upply; and upon her powers the author would willingly have ri&#8747;ked his &#8747;ucce&#8747;s.
</p>
<p>
Now, whether the piece had no merit at all, or whether it had le&#8747;s merit than the dramas which have lately been produced at Covent Garden Theatre, or whether the Author was too ob&#8747;cure, and could not fill the boxes on its appearance, certain it is, that the piece, after a &#8747;hort time, was returned with a no; adding, that where a piece was not accepted, no remarks or &#8747;ugge&#8747;tions were ever made.
</p>
<p>
The Author was now thrown upon the world. As money was his object, he did not apply to the other winter theatre, but pre&#8747;ented it to the Manager of the Haymarket Theatre; thinking it po&#8747;&#8747;ible, if he approved it, that he might engage Mrs. Mattocks to perform the principle character, as he had formerly engaged Mr. Kemble
<pb n="x"/>
for a &#8747;imilar purpo&#8747;e in one of his own pieces. But Mr. Colman thought "its repre&#8747;entation would not &#8747;erve the intere&#8747;ts of the Haymarket Theatre."
</p>
<!-- there is a runover on the line, which produces numerous quotation marks -->
<p>The Author had now only to reflect upon what had been before &#8747;ugge&#8747;ted to him, that the piece was better adapted to the clo&#8747;et than the &#8747;tage, as the character of Veronica could only have its full force with tho&#8747;e who under&#8747;tood botany. This was very true, but it was a circum&#8747;tance that he was aware of even from the beginning. He flattered him&#8747;elf, that as the &#8747;tudy of Botany was very fa&#8747;hionable, and as almo&#8747;t every body knew &#8747;omething of its outlines, the majority of an audience would under&#8747;tand it, and the remainer would be plea&#8747;ed with the comic &#8747;ound of the jargon, when delivered with humour, though unacquainted with its literal meaning. He had heard audiences &#8747;et into roars of laugher by Lingo's bad Latin, though perhaps four-fifths of the audience were unacquainted with the language. Moreover, French, Italian, German, and Scotch characters are generally
<pb n="xi"/>
received with applau&#8747;e, though their language is often perfectly unintelligible.
</p>
<p>Unwilling, like a fond parent, that his child &#8747;hould remain in ob&#8747;curity, the Author con&#8747;igns it to the clo&#8747;et, at the &#8747;ame time intreating the Reader to keep in mind, that it was written principally for acting, and for the &#8747;ingular manner of Mrs. Mattocks, to be &#8747;et off with the farther advantages of mu&#8747;ic, and the mo&#8747;t beautiful &#8747;cenery that can be imagined. Had it appeared on the &#8747;tage, many parts would have been con&#8747;iderably curtailed, as too long for effect in repre&#8747;entation, but which the Author hopes will, neverthele&#8747;s, prove entertaining in the clo&#8747;et, if not ab&#8747;olutely e&#8747;&#8747;ential to his de&#8747;ign: he wi&#8747;hed, as much as po&#8747;&#8747;ible, to realize to his Reader the &#8747;pot where he has laid his &#8747;cene, that tho&#8747;e who have &#8747;een it may recall the original to their minds, and to give the be&#8747;t idea of it in his power to tho&#8747;e who have not.</p>
<p>It only remains to &#8747;ay a few words upon the objects of the ridicule. The Author a&#8747;&#8747;ures him&#8747;elf
<pb n="xii"/>
he is  not &#8747;ingular in thinking the &#8747;tudy of Botany not altogether a proper amu&#8747;ement for the more poli&#8747;hed &#8747;ex; and the fal&#8747;e ta&#8747;te of a licentious age, which is gaining ground, and corrupting the &#8747;oft and elegant manners of the otherwi&#8747;e lovelie&#8747;t part of the creation, requires every di&#8747;couragement which can be given.

<p><i>Landlord.</i> You are welcome to Ke&#8747;wick again, Sir Charles.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles.</i> Thank you, Landlord. -- Again and again, I hope. While Ke&#8747;wick di&#8747;plays its wonders, and health and amu&#8747;ement are to be acquired in &#8747;urveying them, I want nothing but opportunity to bring me here oftener. Have you had much company this &#8747;ea&#8747;on? Many LAKERS?</p>
<p><i>Landlord.</i> Sights of 'em, Sir. The hou&#8747;e is now as full as it can hold; and, if any more &#8747;hould come in, I don't know what we &#8747;hall do.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles.</i> Have you had many people of note?</p>
<p><i>Landlord. </i>No, Sir. Lord Par&#8747;imony was here la&#8747;t week: but then you know, Sir, he travels with only a pair of hor&#8747;es, and orders only a pint of wine.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i> A good hint, Landlord. Why you inn-keepers in the north had once the character of being civil and contented in your manners, and moderate in your charges. Now, if you retain your civility, you are certain to lo&#8747;e your moderation.</p>
<p><i>Landlord. </i>Why, Sir, travellers u&#8747;ed to wonder at the rea&#8747;onablene&#8747;s of our charges, and we are not &#8747;o dull as not to take a hint when it is given us.</p>

<pb n="2"/>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Yes, we mu&#8747;t thank our&#8747;elves for that.</p>
<p><i>Landlord. </i>Sir Incurious Hurry has been here too.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>He never fails. Sir Incurious is &#8747;o pa&#8747;&#8747;ionately fond of travelling, and the Lakes, that he drives po&#8747;t through every country every year, with the carriage windows up, and never gets out but to eat, drink, and &#8747;leep.-- Who el&#8747;e? But I mu&#8747;t call at Crothwaite's and &#8747;ee the li&#8747;t.</p>
<p><i>Landlord. </i>A gentleman was here la&#8747;t week, who inquired after Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale. He is a Cambridge gentleman, Sir, and was here the la&#8747;t time you was.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>With his gun and his rod?</p>
<p><i>Landlord. </i>Never a day but he was out either &#8747;hooting or fi&#8747;hing.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Ay, Tom Angle. The keene&#8747;t &#8747;port&#8747;man that ever lived. He knows the time of every fly, from the green-drake to the palmer-fly.</p>
<p align="center"><i>Enter</i> Speedwell, <i>with a Letter.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Very well. Landlord, I had an early dinner, &#8747;o &#8747;hall want &#8747;ome &#8747;upper.-- Speedwell, where are the &#8747;addle-bags? I want my pocket-book.</p>

<p>"Dear Charles,</p>
<p>"Since we parted at Lanca&#8747;ter, I have gained &#8747;ome intelligence of your pair partner, which I judge advi&#8747;eable to communicate to you. The aunt, whom Lydia mentioned, is Mi&#8747;s Beccabunga Veronica, of Diandria Hall, a great botani&#8747;t and picture&#8747;que traveller, who, with her nephew Bob Kiddy, are taking the tour of the Lakes. Mi&#8747;s Beccabunga has a large fortune, part of which is in her own di&#8747;po&#8747;al; the re&#8747;t goes to Lydia, at her death. She is, I under&#8747;tand, very impatient for a hu&#8747;band --"</p>
<p>Yes, she has been studying the &#8747;y&#8747;tem of plants, till &#8747;he now wi&#8747;hes to know the &#8747;y&#8747;tem of man.</p>
<p>--"and pre&#8747;uming upon Lydia's dependance upon her, during her life, in&#8747;i&#8747;ts upon having the fir&#8747;t attack upon, and refu&#8747;al of, every per&#8747;on who comes in their

way. A title is her ambition. You mu&#8747;t therefore fortify your heart and per&#8747;on again&#8747;t her attacks. No doubt you will &#8747;ee, or hear of, them again, in the cour&#8747;e of your tour: they intend being at Ke&#8747;wick on the twentieth. Adieu. I wi&#8747;h you succe&#8747;s. Yours, &#8747;incerely, though in ha&#8747;te, H. FRIENDLY."</p>
<p>The twentieth! That is, to-day. Here then a new campaign opens upon me. I have to take one heart, whil&#8747;t I re&#8747;i&#8747;t the attacks of another. The &#8747;ervice of Bellona mu&#8747;t, for a &#8747;hort time, give way to that of a milder diety.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Speedwell, <i>with Saddle-bags.</i></p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Put down the &#8747;addle-bags, and come hither. I took you into my &#8747;ervice, Speedwell, while you were yet very young and uninformed. Your parents, though they were poor, were hone&#8747;t, and by their birth de&#8747;erved better than they received from the hands of fortune. Though &#8747;ervants, they have been faithful friends to our family; and I promi&#8747;ed them to take care of you. That promi&#8747;e, I think, I have fulfilled: I have treated you more upon the footing of a friend than a &#8747;ervant; have taught you my&#8747;elf, as far as circum&#8747;tances would permit, and had you in&#8747;tructed by others, both in your duty as a man, and in what other knowledge might be u&#8747;eful to you in pa&#8747;&#8747;ing away your lei&#8747;ure hours in innocent amu&#8747;ement.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>You have never, I hop, Sir, found me wanting in gratitude for your kindne&#8747;s?</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>By no means. I mention not the&#8747;e things to remind you of any obligation you may be under to me, but of the duty you owe your&#8747;elf in enjoying

<pb n="4"/>
the&#8747;e advantages. You have &#8747;erved me faithfully, and I will now put you in a way to better your pro&#8747;pects for life.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>I de&#8747;ire no other pro&#8747;pect, Sir, than that of &#8747;erving Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale till my death.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>You will &#8747;erve me al&#8747;o in &#8747;erving your&#8747;elf. -- You know the whole circum&#8747;tance of my meeting with a lady at the ball of Lanca&#8747;ter. She has my affections, and, if I can gain hers, I mean to offer her my hand. But there is an impediment in the way of our union. She had an aunt, upon whom &#8747;he is dependent during her life, and who claims to her&#8747;elf the privilege of having the fir&#8747;t refu&#8747;al of every man they get acquainted with. I have rea&#8747;on to think they will be Ke&#8747;wick this day, or &#8747;oon. And, to &#8747;creen my&#8747;elf from the attacks of the aunt, whil&#8747;t I may have an opportunity of paying my addre&#8747;&#8747;es to my Lydia, I &#8747;hall change characters with you. You &#8747;hall introduce your&#8747;elf as Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale; and if, under that character, you &#8747;hould like the aunt, and gain her con&#8747;ent, marry her. I will undertake to accommodate matters after: if not, it, at any rate, gives me an opportunity of furthering my love with Lydia unmole&#8747;ted. I am not per&#8747;onally known to her aunt, as &#8747;he left the a&#8747;&#8747;embly indi&#8747;po&#8747;ed early in the evening. You have talents to play the part a&#8747;&#8747;igned to you; you know all my circum&#8747;tances, and have only to order me to attend con&#8747;tantly upon you, and whil&#8747;t, in &#8747;urveying the pro&#8747;pects, you engage the aunt, I &#8747;hall find opportunities with my Lydia. I will &#8747;ettle the affair with our landlord. Therefore put on your character immediately. Get out my dre&#8747;&#8747;ed coat from the &#8747;addle-bags. A red coat has attractions in it&#8747;elf.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>As far as it concerns you, Sir, I will execute the plot to the be&#8747;t of my ability. But no mercenary motives &#8747;hall induce me to marry an unde&#8747;erving woman, or one I cannot love.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>That is a &#8747;entiment, Speedwell, which would do honour to the heart of a peer.</p>
<p>[Speedwell <i>undoes the &#8747;addle-bags, takes out a coloured frock with &#8747;urpri&#8747;e, and &#8747;everal brown-paper parcels, with &#8747;till greater.]</i></p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>If the lady, Sir, is like the turkey-cock, and flies only at the red coat, and not at the wearer, I fear 
<pb n="5"/>
there will be no attack; for the coat has changed its colour, and, what's more, it has changed its fa&#8747;hion.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>How?</p>
<p><i>Speed. (Undoing one of the parcels.) </i>Pieces of linen! I have it, Sir. If you remember, Sir, the landlady at Penrith bought a pair of &#8747;addle-bags into your room, and de&#8747;ired you to let a traveller be there, as the hou&#8747;e was full; "his name was Billy Sample, from Manche&#8747;ter, and he was a <i>virry</i> nice young man." Now I take it, Sir, that either I through mi&#8747;take, or he through de&#8747;ign or mi&#8747;take, has changed the &#8747;addle-bags, and that the&#8747;e are the bagman's patterns.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>How is this? the bags were padlocked.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>Yes, Sir, but ours was a lock that opens with a &#8747;pring without a key, and this is the &#8747;ame. I am confident that I packed them up right, for when you &#8747;aid that the gig was to be left behind to be repaired, and then follow us, I changed &#8747;ome things from the &#8747;eat to the bags.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>How heedle&#8747;s! However, inquire for him here, and at the other hou&#8747;e. If he is not here, you mu&#8747;t go back to Penrith, and &#8747;ee after them. He may be gone another way. But, when he finds his mi&#8747;take, he will be as much di&#8747;appointed as I am, and perhaps come after us.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>He's mo&#8747;t likely coming this way, Sir; for he offered fir&#8747;t you, and then me, a <i>&#8747;ide </i>in his gig.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Well, go and inquire, and keep a lookout for the ladies. <i>(Exit Speedwell.)</i> Happy man! to have another opportunity of conver&#8747;ing with my Lydia, to hear her charming voice, and again be fa&#8747;cinated by her bewitching &#8747;mile!</p>

<p><i>Speed. </i>Sir, I have found them both, the bagman, who has got your coat, and the lady, who has got your heart.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>What, my Lydia?</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>And her aunt, Sir. All three coming in the bagman's gig. I &#8747;uppo&#8747;e they accepted <i>the &#8747;ide</i> you refu&#8747;ed.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Impo&#8747;&#8747;ible!</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>It's true, as I live, Sir; and, what is more, he has got your coat on; and, &#8747;till more than that, your dre&#8747;&#8747;ed hat out of the hat-box. Here they come, Sir.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>A&#8747;toni&#8747;hing! let us &#8747;tand a&#8747;ide and ob&#8747;erve them. Take up the cloathes however.</p>
<head level="3" align="center"><i>Enter</i> Vernonica, Lydia, <i>and</i> Sample <i>in Regimentals, shown in by</i> Landlord, <i>bearing Scotch Plaid, Boxes, etc.</i></head> <!-- there is a special symbol here for etc, for which there is no ascii code. -->
<p><i>Landlord. </i>The party in the be&#8747;t room are going away immediately, and you &#8747;hall have that, Madam. Here is an account of the mu&#8747;eums. <i>(Gives papers.)</i></p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>How &#8747;upremely fortunate! A guide and botani&#8747;t, "well acquainted with the rare <i>indigenous</i> plants of the mountains, rocks, and lakes." I beg you'll de&#8747;ire the guide and botani&#8747;t to repair hither directly.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>(<i>A&#8747;ide to</i> Speed.) That is my cue; do you wait upon the officer. <i>[They retire.]</i></p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Pray &#8747;ee all the things taken out, and bring my drawing-box in&#8747;tantaneou&#8747;ly. I would not lo&#8747;e my &#8747;ketches and the manu&#8747;cript of my tour for the world. I am &#8747;ure, Sir, we are under an infinitude of obligations to you for this favour. If it had not been for your kindne&#8747;s when the Sociable broke down, I don't know what we could po&#8747;&#8747;ibly have done.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>You are very welcome, Mi&#8747;s. But bringing your luggage and all was rather too much. The hor&#8747;e is knocked up.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>O dear, don't give your&#8747;elf any unea&#8747;ine&#8747;s on his account. If he &#8747;hould die, I'll write a monody, or an 
<pb n="7"/>
epitaph, or an elegy upon him, and that will immortalize him.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>But it won't buy me another hor&#8747;e.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>But it will. Publi&#8747;h it on a wire-wove, hot-pre&#8747;&#8747;ed, cream-coloured paper, with the <i>fac-&#8747;imiles</i> on the other &#8747;ide; I'll do &#8747;ome de&#8747;igns for it, and it will &#8747;ell for a guinea.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>But a guinea won't buy me a hor&#8747;e.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>If it is a hundred, you &#8747;hall have it. But pray, may I know to whom I am indebted for this kindne&#8747;s?</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>I always forget my name. It's lucky it's with-in&#8747;ide my hat.<i>(A&#8747;ide, taking off his hat, and looking into it.)</i> Sir Charles Port-in-&#8747;cale, Mi&#8747;s.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>How fortunate! The elegant and accompli&#8747;hed Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale, and a botani&#8747;t too. I mu&#8747;t have him. <i>(A&#8747;ide.)</i> To have received this favour from Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale, of who&#8747;e merits the world &#8747;o loudly &#8747;peaks, adds weight to the obligation, and makes it ine&#8747;timable.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>And pray, Mi&#8747;s, what's your name?</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>You do me infinite honour, Sir Charles; my name is Beccabunga Veronica, of Diandria Hall; my <i>hybernaculum</i> is in Gro&#8747;venor Square. --Lydia--</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Well, Mi&#8747;s Beccy Bungay--</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Why, Lydia, why don't you acknowledge Sir Charles? You know you danced with him at Lanca&#8747;ter.</p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>I had the honour of dancing with Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale at Lanca&#8747;ter. But it was not for me to &#8747;peak fir&#8747;t. What can this mean? <i>(A&#8747;ide.)</i></p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Sir Charles, you don't &#8747;eem to recollect your partner?</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>My partner!</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Don't you remember at Lanca&#8747;ter a&#8747;&#8747;ize-ball? I unfortunately danced the two fir&#8747;t dances in a different &#8747;et, and was then taken &#8747;o ill as to be obliged to go home.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>I wasn't at -- Plague on't! I forget who I am. <i>(A&#8747;ide)</i> O ay; we danced Morgan Ratler.</p>
<head level="3" align="center"><i>Enter</i> Speedwell.</head>
<p><i>Speed. </i>I have &#8747;een the hor&#8747;es taken care of, Sir, ordered your bed, and a bird and bottle for &#8747;upper.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Taken care of!-- bird and bottle!</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>I got here ju&#8747;t half an hour before you, Sir.</p>
<pb n="8"/>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Is this your &#8747;ervant, Sir Charles?</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i> I have the honour, Madam, to &#8747;erve Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>You never told us of him, Sir Charles. I did not know you had a &#8747;ervant with you.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Nor I neither. <i>(A&#8747;side.)</i></p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>It was very unlucky he was gone on when our <i>voiture</i> broke down, or he might have a&#8747;&#8747;i&#8747;ted us in our <i>pericula.</i></p>
<p><i>Sample. </i> That's the name of your carriage, is it? You called it a Sociable ju&#8747;t now. He might have brought one of you behind him.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Ride double! how unpicture&#8747;que! If you have no objection, Sir Charles, we will join parties, and add &#8747;omething to your roa&#8747;t fowl and bottle.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Roa&#8747;t fowl and bottle! 'twould eat up all my profits. I &#8747;hall only have a bit of cold meat and &#8747;ix-pen'orth of brandy and water.</p>
<head level="3" align="center"><i>Enter</i> Sir Charles, <i>in</i> Sample's <i>Cloathes.</i></head>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Oh! the ladies who want me are in this room. <i>(Without.)</i> Does your Lady&#8747;hip want me? I am the guide and botani&#8747;t, Ma'am. <i>(Significantly to Lydia.)</i> Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale. I am the guide and botani&#8747;t. <i>(To Sample.)</i></p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>What, my partner at Lanca&#8747;ter! Was he an impo&#8747;ter then, or is he now? My heart tells me he is true, and I am willing to be guided by him.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Why, what can this mean? This mu&#8747;t be Sir Charles, and in my cloathes. Well, if he won't know me, I'm &#8747;ure I don't wi&#8747;h to know him; and, if he likes my cloathes better than his own, he &#8747;hall have 'em. I &#8747;hall &#8747;ooner make a fortune by a red coat, than by riding for Dimity and Co. <i>(A&#8747;ide.)</i></p>
<p><i>Ver. (Looking through gla&#8747;&#8747;es.)</i> A va&#8747;tly picture&#8747;que figure, I declare! Extremely intere&#8747;ting! What, you are the <i>Ciceroni</i> of Derwent-water? I &#8747;ee, Mr. Botani&#8747;t, that you have complete collections of the plants of the country, ready packed to &#8747;end off. I de&#8747;ire I may have a collection.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>If you Lady&#8747;hip will give me your direction, you may depend upon their being &#8747;ent.</p>
<pb n="9"/>
<p><i>Ver. </i>I mu&#8747;t have them now. I de&#8747;ire you'll get them directly.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>I fear I have not a complete collection by me.</p>
<p><i>Speed. (A&#8747;ide.) </i>Suppo&#8747;e, Sir, you give her one of the bagman's parcels. She will not undo it before &#8747;he goes away from hence.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>I believe here is a collection I was ju&#8747;t going to direct and &#8747;end off; but your Lady&#8747;hip &#8747;hall have them.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Very obliging, indeed! What do they come to? What is the appretiation of them?</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>A guinea, if you plea&#8747;e, Madam.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Sir Charles, may I beg the favour of you to pay for them? Pray untie and let me in&#8747;pect them.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>I beg they may not be undone before you get home, as it would expo&#8747;e them to the air, and they might &#8747;uffer from it. Your Lady&#8747;hip &#8747;hall &#8747;ee another parcel undone before you leave Ke&#8747;wick.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i> Va&#8747;tly well. Sir Charles, I beg the favour of a guinea?</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>I think, Mi&#8747;s Becky, you had better expo&#8747;e them. Why, you wouldn't give a guinea for a parcel of patterns?</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Patterns! We call them &#8747;pecimens, Sir Charles.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Sp<i>ice</i>men! Why &#8747;he doesn't think &#8747;he's buying a bale of gingerbread nuts. But I forget my&#8747;elf. <i>(A&#8747;ide-- gives a guinea.)</i> There, Sir, if they are not right, you give the guinea back again.-- It's very hard to give a guinea for my own goods, when they're not worth it, and not have 'em neither. If he doesn't pay me, I'll melt the gold lace off his coat and pay my&#8747;elf. <i>(A&#8747;ide.)</i></p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>I dare &#8747;ay they are all right. There are the <i>lichens</i> among&#8747;t them, I hope?</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Yes, &#8747;he's a <i>liking</i> for my guinea, I &#8747;ee. <i>(A&#8747;ide.)</i></p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Sir Charles, I &#8747;hall re&#8747;t your debtor.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>I hope not, Mi&#8747;s.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>I &#8747;hall beg, Mr. Botani&#8747;t, to depo&#8747;it my bu&#8747;t and leg in your mu&#8747;eum.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Your Lady&#8747;hip will do me infinite honour, even by &#8747;etting your foot in it.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Very prettily turned indeed.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Your leg, Mi&#8747;s?</p>
<pb n="10"/>
<p><i>Ver. </i>I am a bit of &#8747;culptor, and model in pla&#8747;ter. I had fini&#8747;hed one exqui&#8747;ite bu&#8747;t of my&#8747;elf, &#8747;o cla&#8747;&#8747;ifcal, but I &#8747;poiled it in the baking. I have, however, &#8747;ucceeded tolerably well in my &#8747;econd attempt: but every body &#8747;ays my leg is the fine&#8747;t they ever &#8747;aw, and it is now in the po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ion of every lover of <i>virtu.</i></p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Well, Mi&#8747;s Becky, I don't &#8747;ee much virtue in it, but I &#8747;hould like to &#8747;ee your legs; though I always thought ladies wi&#8747;hed to hide 'em.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>O dear, no! quite the contrary. I played a breeches-part at my theatricals purpo&#8747;sely to &#8747;how my leg. I have ju&#8747;t perfected a highly fini&#8747;hed colo&#8747;&#8747;al &#8747;tateue of the Poli&#8747;h dwarf in marble: I hewed it even from the block; and pre&#8747;ented it to Lord Ta&#8747;tele&#8747;s, -and he has entirely &#8747;poiled it by putting bra&#8747;s buckles, &#8747;word-hilt, and lace to the hat.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Why, 'twould ha'been hand&#8747;omer if he'd gone to the expen&#8747;e of &#8747;ilver.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>We had better take a &#8747;hort perambulation before &#8747;upper.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>If you Lady&#8747;hip plea&#8747;es. An evening pro&#8747;pect from Crow Park is reckoned particularly fine. And, if we go now, we &#8747;hall have the advantage of both the &#8747;un&#8747;et and the ri&#8747;ing moon.</p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>I beg, Madam, that we may go. I am cramped with fitting in the carriage, and make no doubt I &#8747;hall be better for the walk.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>I would not lo&#8747;e it for the world. What a fine de&#8747;cription it will make for my tour. Sir Charles, what &#8747;ay you to a turn? You mu&#8747;t take infinite plea&#8747;ure in viewing the delightful and impre&#8747;&#8747;ive &#8747;cenes of this country, as you travel through it?</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Why, Mi&#8747;s, I u&#8747;ed to &#8747;tare about me a good deal, when I fir&#8747;t came, from the novelty of the thing. But, now I'm u&#8747;ed to it, I think no more of 'em than nothing at all: I think of nothing but taking orders.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Ble&#8747;s me, Sir Charles, I hope you don't think of leaving the army?</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Leaving the army, Mi&#8747;s!-- O ay--O no, Mi&#8747;s.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>You talked of going into the church.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>The church!</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>You &#8747;aid you thought of nothing but <i>taking orders.</i></p>

<pb n="11"/>
<p><i>Sample. </i>O yes, Mi&#8747;s, for our hou&#8747;e. I get my living by it.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>What, you've a family living?</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>I've no family, Mi&#8747;s, but I don't care how &#8747;oon I have one.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>O Sir Charles, you might leave that for your &#8747;econd &#8747;on-- particularly if your wife has a fortune.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>I &#8747;hould not mind at all giving up my travelling bu&#8747;ine&#8747;s to my &#8747;on.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>By no means, Sir Charles; I am a traveller my&#8747;elf.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Are you, Mi&#8747;s? What hou&#8747;e do you travel for? Where are you patterns?</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>You will call them patterns, Sir Charles-- Specimens.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Sp<i>ice</i>men! What, you travel for one of the great We&#8747;t India merchants?</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>I hope to travel for all the world.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>That's too much to hope, Mi&#8747;s.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Not at all, I hope-- I mean to make a thou&#8747;and pounds by my tour.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>That's doing bu&#8747;ine&#8747;s well. But I don't wonder at it. I am &#8747;ure I could not refu&#8747;e giving an order to &#8747;uch a nice creature. But I never heard of a woman traveller before.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Ble&#8747;s me, Sir Charles, why they're quite common.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Well, if I was married, my wife &#8747;hould go one way and I another.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>That is the modern fa&#8747;hion to be &#8747;ure: but I cannot &#8747;ay I &#8747;hould like it.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Why, then we'd go together. I'd travel in the Manche&#8747;ter line, and you in the We&#8747;t India.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Why, that would be travelling the &#8747;ame way with a witne&#8747;s.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Yes, yes, we &#8747;hould witne&#8747;s each other's dealings.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>A va&#8747;tly &#8747;ingular man is this Sir Charles. Not very poli&#8747;hed, nor very accompli&#8747;hed. However, I mu&#8747;t have him. His fortune and title are both good, and I &#8747;hall have the merit of improving him. <i>(A&#8747;ide.)</i> Pray, Sir Charles, could you be contented to be a <i>monogymia</i><ptr target="n2"/> all your life?</p>

<pb n="15"/>
in our way from the <i>auberge</i> to Crow Park, my ears were &#8747;truck with &#8747;ome of the mo&#8747;t intere&#8747;ting &#8747;ounds I ever heard, and which irre&#8747;i&#8747;tibly arre&#8747;ted my foot&#8747;teps. It was a blind beggar, relating in plaintive numbers his melancholy &#8747;tory. By his &#8747;ide he had a dumb, but an able advocate, who, with mute eloquence, made the mo&#8747;t forcible appeal to one's charity. A little dog was attached to his &#8747;ide, who, in a &#8747;upplicatory po&#8747;ture, joined in the eleemo&#8747;ynary claims of his ma&#8747;ter. I dropped a trifle into the maimed mandicant's hat with a tear -- another was about to follow it, but, a&#8747;hamed of the amiable weakne&#8747;s, I caught the fooli&#8747;h pearl in my handkerchief, and trea&#8747;ured it up in the faithful repo&#8747;itory of my bo&#8747;om." There, I think that was a very <i>happy</i> &#8747;entence. What is your opinion, Sir Charles?</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>I think it is a mi&#8747;erable one, Mi&#8747;s.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>I don't know how I could alter it for the better, unle&#8747;s I were to be "napkin" in&#8747;tead of "handkerchief," for the &#8747;ake of <i>euphony.</i></p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>For who&#8747;e &#8747;ake, Mi&#8747;s? You may call it "muckinder," if you like it better.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>I really believe he has a mind to laugh at me. I may perhaps introduce a quotation or two. Perhaps, Sir Charles, you can give me a line or two from Horace, or Juvenal, or Tacitus, or --; but that will do when I come to make it out fuller. I think it is per&#8747;picuou&#8747;ly enarrated. Come, Mr. Botani&#8747;t, pray &#8747;how us the way: the day is getting deciduous. Farewell, my friend; I &#8747;ympathize in the &#8747;ecret of your &#8747;orrows. <i>(Sir Charles and Lydia give him money.)</i></p>

<p align="center"><i>Crow Park.</i></p>
<p><i>The &#8747;cene repre&#8747;ents the view cro&#8747;s</i> Derwent-water <i>into the gorge of</i> Borrowdale, <i>and</i> Lowdore <i>water-fall in the di&#8747;tance. The front of the &#8747;tage repre&#8747;ents</i> Crow Park; <i>about the middle, towards the right hand &#8747;ide, is</i> Vicar's I&#8747;land, <i>with the hou&#8747;e &#8747;een &#8747;ideways, the church in full view. The warm glow of &#8747;un&#8747;et pervades the land&#8747;cape at fir&#8747;t, and gradually dies away. A &#8747;hort interval of gloom &#8747;ucceeds, and the mooon then ri&#8747;es from behind the mountains of </i>Borrowdale.</p>
<p>Veronica <i>enters with a bunch of flowers in her hand,</i> Sir Charles <i>on one &#8747;ide and </i>Sample <i>on the other,</i> Lydia <i>following, and </i>Speedwell <i>at a di&#8747;tance, carrying</i> Veronica's <i>paraphrenalia.</i></p>
<p><i>Ver. </i> A va&#8747;tly curious plant indeed, Mr. Botani&#8747;t! A <i>non-de&#8747;cript,</i> you &#8747;ay?</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>You gather herbs, do you? What, are you anything of a doctor?</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>It's a <i>tetrandria tetragynia</i>, I &#8747;ee. The <i>penducle</i> is <i>articulated</i>, <i>membranaceous</i>, <i>umbelliferous</i>, and <i>tomento&#8747;e</i>; as are al&#8747;o the <i>petioles</i>. The leaves are <i>cauline</i>, <i>petiolated</i> and <i>lanceolate</i>; the <i>corolla</i> is <i>polypetalous</i>; the <i>calyx</i> is <i>monophyllous</i>; the <i>pericarpium</i> is <i>tricoccous</i>, and the <i>&#8747;emen</i> a <i>nux</i>. We mu&#8747;t give it a name, Mr. Botani&#8747;t. Wait a &#8747;hort time, and we will call it, from my&#8747;elf, the Portin&#8747;calia. (<i>A&#8747;ide to him.</i>)</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>It will be a long time, if we wait till then. <i>(A&#8747;ide.)</i></p>
<p><i>Sample. (A&#8747;ide.) </i>What a deal to have to &#8747;ay to one little bit of a plant! Poor woman! I am afraid &#8747;he does not know what &#8747;he's talking about.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>I mu&#8747;t have a &#8747;pecimen for my <i>hortus &#8747;iccus.</i> Sir Charles, you don't &#8747;eem to admire it.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>I don't think much of it indeed, Mi&#8747;s. The colour's &#8747;o dim, and it's got no &#8747;mell.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Why, what botani&#8747;t ever thought of colour or &#8747;mell in a plant? Speedwell, give me my botany box.</p>
<p><i>(Puts plants in.)</i> There, take care of it.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>What, I &#8747;uppo&#8747;e you pre&#8747;s 'em in books? I've &#8747;een a many do &#8747;o. But I never could think what they were for, unle&#8747;s it was for making patterns for printing cotton.</p>
<pb n="17"/>
<p><i>Ver. </i>O Sir Charles! I am no &#8747;tranger to your perfect knowledge of the Linn&#230;an &#8747;y&#8747;tem.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>I think, Mi&#8747;s, I do know a good deal about linens.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Inten&#8747;ely a&#8747;toni&#8747;hing! Pray, Sir Charles, do you understand German?</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>No, Mi&#8747;s -- not your jargon. <i>(A&#8747;ide.)</i></p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Why every body of ta&#8747;te reads German now. I de&#8747;ign to work up the &#8747;tory of the Vi&#8747;ionary Hor&#8747;eman on Souther-Fell-&#8747;ide into a ballad in imitation of the German.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>This, Madam, is the celebrated lake of Ke&#8747;wick, or Derwent-water; and the place where we now are, Crow Park, Mr. We&#8747;t's &#8747;econd &#8747;tation. It was formerly a glade of ancient oaks, but the wa&#8747;ting hand of avarice has &#8747;poiled it of its beauties.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Oh! if one &#8747;ingle tree had remained, this would have been an unparallelled &#8747;pot! Stop a minute, if you plea&#8747;e, Mr. <i>Ciceroni,</i> while I get out my pencil to write. <i>(She writes while he gives his account.)</i></p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>This &#8747;pacious ampitheatre of picture&#8747;que mountains, with the pellucid waters lying at their ba&#8747;e, variegated with i&#8747;lands, adorned with wood, or clothed with the &#8747;weete&#8747;t verdure, pre&#8747;ents a picture as fine as the imagination can form. You look directly acro&#8747;s the lake, for three miles, into the gorge of Borrowdale, where Ca&#8747;tle Crag guards the tremendous pa&#8747;s. To the left is the renowned cataract of Lowdore, now &#8747;een only as a &#8747;ilvery &#8747;treak on the &#8747;ide of the mountains. A&#8747;hne&#8747;s Crag towers to its left, and Falcon Crag, Wallow Crag, and Ca&#8747;tle Hill, are the mountains which &#8747;weep beyond them. The fine range of fells to the right (for every crag of every mountain has its name), are Grange-fells, Gold&#8747;cope, Catbells, Newlands, High-&#8747;tyle, Red-pike, and Caw&#8747;ey-pike; Barrow and Swin&#8747;ide below it, with the thick woods of Foe-park at their feet.</p>
<p>This lake is often troubled with what are called "bottom winds:" being a commotion of the water, as if agitated by a &#8747;udden gu&#8747;t, without any real hurricane or apparent cau&#8747;e.</p>
<p>The i&#8747;land neare&#8747;t to us is Vicar's I&#8747;land; beyond, to the left, Lord's I&#8747;land, once the property of the unfortunate family of Radcliffs Earls of Derwent-water; beyond that, Ramp&#8747;holm; and to the right, beyond
<pb n="18"/>
Vicar's, is St. Herbert's I&#8747;land, where he had a hermitage, the foundations of which are now vi&#8747;ible.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>A very happy thought, I declare: quite a <i>beau id&#233;e!</i> You mu&#8747;t know, Sir Charles, I have always &#8747;everal works in hand at the &#8747;ame time; and, as I always introduce a great deal of de&#8747;cription of &#8747;cenery in my romances, I keep that in my eye while I am travelling, and write a romance at the &#8747;ame time with my tours. It is only putting Geneva for Windermere, and, though I have never been abroad, I de&#8747;cribe the &#8747;cenery exactly as well as if I had been there. But I think I &#8747;hall lay the &#8747;cene of my next upon Derwent-water, make St. Herbert to have murdered a pilgrim, who &#8747;hall turn out to be his brother, and I &#8747;hall call it "The Horrors of the Hermitage." I can introduce a my&#8747;terious monk of Borrowdale, and &#8747;hall have fine opportunities of de&#8747;cribing luxuriant groves and bowery lanes, in all the pomp of foliage of beech, birch, mountain-a&#8747;h, and holly. It &#8747;hall be a romance of the fourteenth century; and the ca&#8747;tle upon Lord's I&#8747;land &#8747;hall be haunted by an armed head: and, I believe, Lydia, I &#8747;hall draw my heroine from either you or my&#8747;elf, and make her pa&#8747;&#8747;ionately fon of drawing an botany; &#8747;he &#8747;hall be mi&#8747;tre&#8747;s of the Linn&#230;an &#8747;y&#8747;tem<ptr target="n6"/>, and then, if I &#8747;hould make her &#8747;top, in the mid&#8747;st of her di&#8747;tre&#8747;&#8747;es, to admire the &#8747;cenery, or gather a plant, it will be perfectly natural.</p>
<note id="n6">Linn&#230;us lived in the pre&#8747;ent century.</note>
<p><i>Sample. </i>What a villain! murder his brother! Why he didn't murder his brother, did he?</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Not that I know of.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Why, you wouldn't go to tell lies about the dead then, would you? If his relations were to take it up, they might put you into the pillory for a libel.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Sir Charles! --But I will not be in&#8747;ulted by him. I will not &#8747;uffer him to break it off. <i>(A&#8747;ide.)</i> --Va&#8747;tly impre&#8747;&#8747;ive &#8747;cenery indeed; and quite accordant with &#8747;olemn tone of feeling at this moment. Pray where is Saddleback?</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Behind you, Madam, beyond Skiddaw, where the &#8747;un is now &#8747;etting.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>She carries her &#8747;addle-bags behind her too when &#8747;he travels. She's a rum one, as ever I met with.</p>
<pb n="19"/>
<p><i>Ver. How infinitely &#8747;ublime! Is not it, Sir Charles?</i></p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Yes, Mi&#8747;s, it's very mountainious. You are in the mountain-&#8747;cenery line, I &#8747;ee.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Speedwell, give me my gla&#8747;&#8747;es. Where's my Gray? <i>(Speedwell gives gla&#8747;&#8747;es.)</i> Oh! Claude and Pou&#8747;&#8747;in are nothing. By the bye, where's my Claude-Lorrain? I mu&#8747;t throw a Gilpin tint over the&#8747;e magic &#8747;cenes of beauty. <i>(Looks through the gla&#8747;s.)</i> How gloomily glaring! Now the blue. (<i>Pretends to &#8747;hiver with cold.</i>) How frigidly frozen! What illu&#8747;ions of vi&#8747;ion! The effect is inexpre&#8747;&#8747;ibly intere&#8747;ting. The amphitheatrical per&#8747;pective of the long land&#8747;cape; the peeping points of the many-coloured crags of the head-long mountains, looking out mo&#8747;t intere&#8747;tingly from the picture&#8747;que luxuriance of the bowery foliage, margining their ruggedne&#8747;s, and feathering the fells; the delightful differences of the heterogeneous ma&#8747;&#8747;es; the horrific mountains, &#8747;uch &#8747;cenes of ruin and privation! the turfy hillocks, the umbrageous and repo&#8747;ing hue of the cop&#8747;y lawns, &#8747;o touchingly beautiful; the limpid lap&#8747;e of Lowdore, the i&#8747;lands coroneting the flood; the water, the &#8747;oft purple of the pigeon's neck, -- are &#8747;o many circum&#8747;tances of imagery, which all together combine a picture, which for its &#8747;entimental beauty and a&#8747;&#8747;emblages of &#8747;ublimity, I never exceeded in the warme&#8747;t glow of my fancied de&#8747;criptions. And then the imcomparable verdure of the turfy &#8747;lope we are upon; the water bickering at the ba&#8747;e; the &#8747;ultry low of the cattle, &#8747;ipping the clear wave, add a &#8747;weet pathos to the magical effect of the &#8747;urrounding &#8747;cenery. And now the effulgence of the &#8747;un&#8747;hine land&#8747;cape is fading away, and the blue di&#8747;tances, &#8747;tealing upon the nearer view, &#8747;often the &#8747;ublime &#8747;everity. --I mu&#8747;t take a &#8747;ketch. -- Sir Charles, pray come and &#8747;tand by me for the trunk of an old tree in the foreground. And I beg, Mr. Botani&#8747;t, you and Lydia and Speedwell will form your&#8747;elves into a picture&#8747;que group.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>What, Mi&#8747;s, your are a planner, I &#8747;ee; and are come to look about you and &#8747;py your fancies. Pray, Mi&#8747;s, what's this you call your Cordovan?</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>My Claude-Lorrain! it is a <i>deceptio vi&#8747;us</i>, an artifice to give the various tints of the changes of weather and &#8747;ea&#8747;on to the land&#8747;cape.</p>

<p><i>Sample. </i>Why, it's no more like the thing than-- Why, you've made the hills more like &#8747;ugar-loaves--</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>If it is not like what it <i>is</i>, it is what it <i>ought</i> to be. I have only made it picture&#8747;que.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>The painter has always a licence to improve upon Nature, where &#8747;he has erred or been deficient.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Certainly. I have only given the hills an Alpine form, and put &#8747;ome wood where it is wanted, and omitted it where it is not wanted: and who could put that &#8747;ham church and that hou&#8747;e into a picture? It quite <i>antipathizes.</i> I don't like &#8747;uch meretricious ornaments.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Why, that place is a tea-garden, I &#8747;uppo&#8747;e.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Ha! Ha! ha! you are va&#8747;tly witty, Sir Charles. Not a bad compari&#8747;on of yours.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Your Lady&#8747;hip forgets the motto to the i&#8747;land: "<i>De gu&#8747;tibus non e&#8747;t di&#8747;putandum.</i>"</p>
<pb n="21"/>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Gu&#8747;tibus!-- di&#8747;put!-- Pray, Sir Charles, what does that mean?</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>What can I &#8747;ay? <i>(A&#8747;ide.)</i> Oh, aye!-- "It is not to be di&#8747;puted but there are gu&#8747;ts upon the lake."</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Oh! aluuding to the bottom winds, I &#8747;uppo&#8747;e. But what has that to do, Mr. Botani&#8747;t, with--? Well-- &#8747;o, I have made the church an old abbey, the hou&#8747;e a ca&#8747;tle, and the battery an hermitage: I have broken the &#8747;mooth &#8747;urface of the water with water-lillies, flags, flowering ru&#8747;hes, water-docks, and other aquatics, making it more of a pla&#8747;hy inundation than a ba&#8747;in of water: then I have put in for the foreground the &#8747;ingle tree they ought to have left &#8747;tanding, an ancient tree of remarkable &#8747;ize and venerable beauty; and have &#8747;prinkled &#8747;ome ferms, and burdocks, and gor&#8747;e, and thi&#8747;tles, over this turfy &#8747;lope. I mu&#8747;t, I think, do this in colours: an orange sky, yellow water, a blue bank, a green ca&#8747;tle, and brown trees, will give it a very fine effect. Sir Charles, how do you like it?</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>I can't make neither head nor tail on't. Why, Mi&#8747;s, you might as well draw a head with a goggle eye and a hooked no&#8747;e, a wide mouth and a double chin, and give it a beard and a wig, and call it my picture.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Sir Charles!-- <i>(A flute is heard at a di&#8747;tance playing the air of "A Shepard once."</i> Veronica <i>drops her book and her pencil, and &#8747;tands li&#8747;tening.)</i> What a picture&#8747;que &#8747;ound!

<p align="center"><i>Sir Charles.</i></p>
<p>If we go on in this manner, Speedwell, it is impo&#8747;&#8747;ible but our &#8747;chemes mu&#8747;t fail. That ignorant booby, Sample, has no more idea of per&#8747;onating the character he has a&#8747;&#8747;umed, than--</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>A cow has of dancing a hornpipe, Sir.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>About as much. How unlike he is to many of his profe&#8747;&#8747;ion! I have conver&#8747;ed with &#8747;ome who have been men of good &#8747;en&#8747;e and con&#8747;iderable information; but he &#8747;eems to think, that it is only putting on the dre&#8747;s, and he becomes the character without farther trouble. If Veronica were not blinded by vanity, folly, and botanic nuptials, &#8747;he mu&#8747;t have immediately di&#8747;covered the impo&#8747;ition.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>Well, Sir, it is but having recour&#8747;e, at la&#8747;t, to your original plan. Suppo&#8747;e we confe&#8747;s the impo&#8747;ture, &#8747;ay I am the real Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale, who a&#8747;&#8747;umed the di&#8747;gui&#8747;e of a &#8747;ervant to contemplate her charms unob&#8747;erved him&#8747;elf, and that Sample is my &#8747;ervant? You, Sir, may &#8747;still retain your character of guide and botani&#8747;t.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Not a bad &#8747;cheme, Speedwell: but how &#8747;hall we get Sample to come into it?</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>Why, Sir, there is an argument that I have often known to be made u&#8747;e of, and which is &#8747;ure of prevailing when all others fail -- the <i>argumentum beculinum.</i> You have acquie&#8747;ced in his impo&#8747;ture &#8747;o long as it was practicable; and, if he will not come into yours, no doubt the rattan will convince him of the nece&#8747;&#8747;ity of it.</p>
<pb n="24"/>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>But the fellow has not talents to per&#8747;onate even a &#8747;ervant well. Take him from his profits and his patterns, and he has not three ideas beyond.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>If he is awkward, Sir, it is only &#8747;ending him to the &#8747;table or the kitchen.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Of your talents I have no doubt: you &#8747;o well know my circumstances, my manners, and even my acquirements, from copying over my writings, from books I have recommended to you, and from our conver&#8747;ation on the road, that I question whether your knowledge does not exceed Veronica's. I have often explained to you the outlines of Linn&#230; Sy&#8747;tem of Vegetables; you therefore can very well</p>

<p><i>Speed. </i>Bating for hard words, Sir, I think I can match Veronica from the marriage of one male and one female to the clande&#8747;tine marriages of Gretna Green. I thought, as &#8747;oon as I &#8747;aw Sample, that it might come to this, and therefore was not idle with my eyes. I think, Sir, &#8747;ome glances, which I ca&#8747;t upon her, were not thrown away. Here comes the adventurous knight, Sir: we will di&#8747;pel the enchantment which holds him.</p>
<p align="center"><i>Enter</i> Sample.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Here they are both together. I don't know what to &#8747;ay. <i>(A&#8747;ide.)</i> Go, Speedwell, and &#8747;ee the hor&#8747;es taken care of.-- Why don't you go?</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>I am no &#8747;ervant of yours, Sir.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Why, you &#8747;aid your&#8747;elf you was.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>When you &#8747;aid you were Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>I haven't &#8747;aid I'm not he.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>But we do, Sir. Here is the true Sir Charles, and you are only an impo&#8747;tor.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>I think he's an impo&#8747;tor.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Come, Sir, I will explain matters. By mi&#8747;take we exchanged luggage; you got my regimentals, and I your frock and patterns. Deprived of your bu&#8747;ine&#8747;s
<pb n="25"/>
by the lo&#8747;s, I &#8747;uppo&#8747;e you wi&#8747;hed to indemnify your&#8747;elf, by making your fortune with the red coat. You appeared to be making up to the lady I wi&#8747;hed to avoid, and I therefore acquie&#8747;ced in your &#8747;cheme till you ruined it for your&#8747;elf. You have di&#8747;gu&#8747;ted the lady; and, unle&#8747;s the impo&#8747;ture is confe&#8747;&#8747;ed, &#8747;he mu&#8747;t di&#8747;cover it her&#8747;elf.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>That is, Sir, you have put on the lion's &#8747;kin; but the long ears, and your braying, have betrayed you.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>In &#8747;hort, Sir, it is impo&#8747;&#8747;ible for you to &#8747;ucceed with her; and, as I have an intere&#8747;t to &#8747;erve, you mu&#8747;t come into my &#8747;chemes, in return for my acquie&#8747;cence in yours. My affections are fixed upon the niece, and, were I to declare my&#8747;elf, I &#8747;hould lo&#8747;e her, and expo&#8747;e my&#8747;elf to the attacks of the aunt. My farther di&#8747;gui&#8747;e is therefore nece&#8747;&#8747;ary, and, to countenance that, my &#8747;ervant mu&#8747;t declare you an impo&#8747;tor, that he is the true Sir Charles, and you mu&#8747;t con&#8747;ent to pa&#8747;s for his &#8747;ervant.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>No, don't you think it. I won't demean my&#8747;elf to be a &#8747;ervant to a &#8747;ervant. You your&#8747;elf &#8747;aid I was Sir Charles, and you can't confe&#8747;s having told a lie.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Then this, Sir, is the alternative. The impo&#8747;ture mu&#8747;t be acknowledged, and you mu&#8747;t relinqui&#8747;h your character. Our luggage mu&#8747;t be re-exchanged; I have my regimentals, and you your frock and patterns; for that mi&#8747;take, we can only be &#8747;orry for the inconvenience it has occa&#8747;ioned. But, Sir, recollect my <i>hat</i> was left in the care of the landlord, and by what felonious means you become po&#8747;&#8747;e&#8747;&#8747;ed of it, I know not; that you mu&#8747;t explain to the ju&#8747;tice, before whom you will be taken to give an account.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>I beg, Sir, that may be deferred a e &#8747;hort time. I have received an in&#8747;ult from him; he &#8747;aid "he would not <i>demean</i> him&#8747;elf to be a &#8747;ervant of a &#8747;ervant," meaning me; and I beg that I may fir&#8747;t have an opportunity of &#8747;atisfying my honour, by calling him out to fight me with pi&#8747;tols, or, if he refu&#8747;es me that &#8747;atisfaction, I may kick him through Ke&#8747;wick.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Ju&#8747;tice! Pi&#8747;tols! Kicked through Ke&#8747;wick! Well, but now if I con&#8747;ent?</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>I &#8747;hall be &#8747;atisfied.</p>
<pb n="26"/>
<p><i>Speed. </i>And &#8747;o will my honour. It will be a recantation.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>And I &#8747;hall have my patterns back, and you'll pay me my guinea?</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>And &#8747;atisfy you for any other lo&#8747;s you may have been at.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>And give him an order, Sir, for a piece of cloth, to make wai&#8747;tcoats.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>It's a bargain then; and I &#8747;hall be glad to get into my own cloathes again; for I feel a little awkward in the&#8747;e. It's harder to be a baronet and a captain than I thought for: I find it is not the &#8747;carlet coat and gold lace that makes the officer.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Come, then, Speedwell, you and Mr. Sample mu&#8747;t changed cloathes, and the &#8747;ooner the di&#8747;covery is made the better.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>I &#8747;hall be changed in an in&#8747;tant, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Enter </i>Veronica, <i>her hair partly done up in a &#8747;ilk net, partly hanging loo&#8747;e, a &#8747;traw hat and green veil, her gown fanta&#8747;tically drawn up.</i></p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Mr. Botani&#8747;t, I am infinitely di&#8747;tre&#8747;&#8747;ed, quite in de&#8747;pair, that we cannot go up Skiddaw this morning.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Skiddaw has got his nightcap on, Madam, and, were we to go up, we could not &#8747;ee anything of the &#8747;urrounding country.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Well, I'll wait till to-morrow morning, and then I mu&#8747;t go up whether it is fine or not. My tour would be ab&#8747;olutely incomplete without an account of a ride up Skiddaw. I can a&#8747;&#8747;ure you I had dre&#8747;&#8747;ed on purpo&#8747;e for the expedition.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>You would have found that dre&#8747;s rather too light and airy for that cold atmo&#8747;phere.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Not at all. You mu&#8747;t have taken my Scotch plaid to thrown round me when the air became very thin. A riding-habit would not have done at all in the mountain region; it would have broken in upon the <i>co&#8747;tum&#233;.</i> So I have negligently bound up all my hair in a &#8747;ilk net, and &#8747;uffered &#8747;ome tre&#8747;&#8747;es to e&#8747;cape to play upon my neck and round my countenance. And then the light drapery of my dre&#8747;s, my &#8747;traw hat, the veil impartially concealing my face, my figure and my air, are what might, I think, be copied for a Grecian nymph.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>(<i>A&#8747;ide</i>) A Grecian nymph in a Scotch plaid, upon the mountains of Cumberland! What a pre&#8747;ervation of the <i>costume!</i></p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>However, it will equally accord with the &#8747;cenery round Derwent-water: I &#8747;hall appear like the Na&#239;ad of Lowdore, or the nympth of Borrowdale.</p>
<pb n="28"/>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Your Lady&#8747;hip is very con&#8747;iderate. Were an arti&#8747;t to be there at the &#8747;ame time, he mu&#8747;t think him&#8747;elf &#8747;ingularly happy in having &#8747;o charming a figure to give life to his land&#8747;cape.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>You are va&#8747;tly obliging, Mr. Botani&#8747;t. I have &#8747;at once to Mr. Daubly for my picture, which is to be fini&#8747;hed again&#8747;t the next exhibition. I am depicted as the modern godde&#8747;s of botany: I am &#8747;itting upon the stump of a tree, which has been grafted with innumerable different kinds of &#8747;hrubs-- the various <i>Syringas: foliis ovato-cordatis, foliis lanceolatis</i>; the <i>Cyti&#8747;as</i>, the <i>Ce&#8747;iras</i>, the <i>Lycias</i>, <i>Loniceras</i>; --which branch round and form a bower over my head. Every flower &#8747;prings up around me, and a water-fall da&#8747;hes by my &#8747;ide: I have a full-blown mo&#8747;s-ro&#8747;e upon my head in&#8747;tead of a cap, and mo&#8747;s-ro&#8747;e buds hanging about my neck and &#8747;houlders, in&#8747;tead of hair. Two wreathes of honey&#8747;uckle twine around my neck and my wai&#8747;t, and under my garment, which is &#8747;lightly drawn up, in&#8747;tead of a &#8747;tocking, appears the bark of a tree.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>(<i>A&#8747;ide</i>) The godde&#8747;s of botany with a wooden leg!</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>My feet are covered with the <i>con&#8747;erva rivularis</i>, with a large ro&#8747;e upon each of them. In my hand I hold my poem, in twenty cantos, "The Triumph of Botany," while the Arts and Sciences are all paying homage to me. The <i>coup d'&#339;il</i> is exceedingly fine; and I do not recollect to have &#8747;een anything like it before. </p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Not exactly, Madam --except the owl in the ivy-bu&#8747;h. (<i>A&#8747;ide.</i>)</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>I mentioned my poem: the &#8747;ubject is, I think, extremely intere&#8747;ting, and purely cla&#8747;&#8747;ical. You know, Sir, that the botani&#8747;t and the flori&#8747;t have long been at variance; the flori&#8747;t only e&#8747;teems a few, and tho&#8747;e chiefly the double flowers, which the botani&#8747;t con&#8747;iders as mon&#8747;ters. Now I &#8747;uppo&#8747;e, that, after repeated ho&#8747;tilities, which are the &#8747;ubject of the former part of the poem, <i>Lonicera &#8747;empervirens</i>, or trumpet honey&#8747;uckle, is &#8747;ent, as a herald, to call a parley, and the parties meet on the plain of <i>Enna</i>, &#8747;o much celebrated by the poets for its flowers and the rape of Pro&#8747;erpina. <i>Flora</i> enters in a wheel-barrow, the garden carriage, driving <i>Hyacinthus</i>, <i>Carnatia</i>, <i>Aurioula</i>, <i>Tulippa</i>, <i>Jonquilla</i>, <i>Ranunculus</i>, and <i>Polyanthus</i>, eight in hand, and is attended <!-- The J in Jonquilla uses a special character I can't recognise here -->
<pb n="29"/>
by Cupids, as gardeners, bearing &#8747;ilver cream-pots and all the prizes given to flori&#8747;ts' fea&#8747;ts. <i>Botania</i> is borne in a tin box, the botani&#8747;ts' conveyance, by eight of her favourites; and, after debating the matter, as we do at Coachmakers' Hall, which introduces an epi&#8747;ode upon that elegant amu&#8747;ement, it is agreed that they &#8747;hall henceforth unite their powers, and live promi&#8747;cuou&#8747;ly in fields or gardens: a pageant takes place, in which all their adherents appear two and two, attended by Gnomes and Sylphs: Botania and Flora change their cars, and a triumphal &#8747;ong is chanted to their joint honour.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>How new and how truly poetic is the idea!</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>You compliment.-- But ble&#8747;s me! where is Sir Charles? We had better be &#8747;etting off.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Which does your Lady&#8747;hip mean? For one was Sir Charles yesterday, and the other to-day; like Archer and Aimwell, they take it by turns, I believe, to be ma&#8747;ter and &#8747;ervant.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>How!</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Here comes the gentleman to &#8747;peak for him&#8747;elf. With your permi&#8747;&#8747;ion, I will wait upon the young lady, and give her &#8747;ome farther in&#8747;ight into your favourite &#8747;cience.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>By all means. We will overtake you towards Lowdore.</p>
<p align="right">[<i>Exit</i> Sir Charles.</p>
<p align="center"><i>Enter</i> Speedwell, <i>in regimentals.</i></p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>Aba&#8747;hed with &#8747;hame, I am come, mo&#8747;t lovely of women, to implore your pardon, for an impo&#8747;ition which I have practi&#8747;ed upon you.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>How! Speedwell!</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>I am, Madam, the unhappy and the happy man who would no longer be thought Speedwell, but Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale. Willing to witne&#8747;s, unob&#8747;erved by the lovely Beccabunga Veronica, tho&#8747;e charms of which the world &#8747;peaks &#8747;o highly, but which I believed it impo&#8747;&#8747;ible for mortal to be endowed with, I changed characters with my &#8747;ervant, and viewed them at humble di&#8747;tance. Who could &#8747;ee, and not love? Have pity upon me then, and, in &#8747;ealing my doom, remember that my death follows your refu&#8747;al, and my happine&#8747;s your gracious conde&#8747;cen&#8747;ion.</p>
<pb n="30"/>
<p><i>Ver. </i>And &#8747; you think I have &#8747;o little penetration as not to know you?</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>I hope &#8747;o. (<i>A&#8747;ide.</i>)</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Is it po&#8747;&#8747;ible that the accompli&#8747;hments of Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale could really be concealed under the appearance of a menial?</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>She has not di&#8747;covered us, I hope. (<i>A&#8747;ide.</i>)</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>No, Sir Charles, I have more penetration that that: though you &#8747;eem to think not, by attempting to pa&#8747;s your&#8747; vulgar, illiterate &#8747;ervant upon me as your&#8747;elf. That chivalric air of yours is not to be imitated. I can a&#8747;&#8747;ure you that I was not in&#8747;en&#8747;ible to the dear "&#8747;peechle&#8747;s me&#8747;&#8747;ages" which I received from your eyes: but you know, Sir Charles, if I had not given into it, I &#8747;hould have &#8747;poilt one of the be&#8747;t incidents that could po&#8747;&#8747;ibly occur for my tour. It is a mo&#8747;t picture&#8747;que incident, and perfectly cla&#8747;&#8747;ical. The heathen deities, you know, often changed their forms, to pur&#8747;ue their amours, and your royal name&#8747;ake travelled, like you, in di&#8747;gui&#8747;e, &#8747;ecretly to witne&#8747;s the charms of his intended.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>How amiable is this forgiving kindne&#8747;s! Yet, how &#8747;hall I apologi&#8747;e for the in&#8747;ults offered by my &#8747;ervant?</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>O dear, don't mention them. His vulgarity and po&#8747;itivity were a little di&#8747;tre&#8747;&#8747;ing; and, as I am not a <i>me&#8747;embryanthemum cry&#8747;tallinum</i>, I could not forbear now and then &#8747;howing a little &#8747;pontaneity of &#8747;cintillation: I am certainly pho&#8747;phore&#8747;cent, like the <i>Trop&#339;olum</i>; but your &#8747;ubmi&#8747;&#8747;ion di&#8747;arms me.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>Unexampled goodne&#8747;s! Then let me hope that the flame which warms my heart is an&#8747;wered by a kindred blaze in yours.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Wel, then, I will be equally frank with your&#8747;elf: in &#8747;hort, Sir Charles, I am not willing to be &#8747;olely female all my like, like the <i>capri&#8747;ca</i>. And what woman, when offered the hand of Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale, could refu&#8747;e it? </p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>O &#8747;ay, when will you complete my happine&#8747;s? Were I to lo&#8747;e you --were you to alter you mind--</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Never, Sir Charles --And to convince you --But money can be no object to you --Yet, Sir Charles, I have a tolerable fortune, and, to convince you of my love, I in&#8747;i&#8747;t upon your taking a bond for my forfeiting it all, in ca&#8747;e of a refu&#8747;al.</p>
<pb n="31"/>
<p><i>Speed. </i>By no means. Recollect, I have once deceived you.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>I beg you will not &#8747;ay &#8747;o, Sir Charles; you have not deceived me. I merely humoured the deception for the &#8747;ake of the incident. If you refu&#8747;e to take it, Sir Charles, I &#8747;hall think you are not &#8747;incere. Here is pen, ink, and paper, and you &#8747;hall have it immediately. (<i>Sits down and writes.</i>)</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>Am I to blame for this? She makes love, to her own en&#8747;naring. (<i>A&#8747;ide.</i>) But, Madam, how do you know that I am not &#8747;till an impo&#8747;tor? Are you certain I am Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale? If hereafter you &#8747;hould find I have deceived you--</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Then blame me, and I'll forgive you. (<i>Gives a bond.</i>) Do you think I could, even for a moment, have encouraged that vulgar fellow, but out of regard for his charming prototype? I declare, I remind myself to <i>Collin&#8747;onia:</i></p>

You have been plea&#8747;ed to &#8747;elect me from amoung&#8747;t the thou&#8747;ands you have &#8747;een; and, not to be &#8747;en&#8747;ible of the honour, would betray a heart incapable of love or of reason. To become your wife will be my honour, as well as my hapine&#8747;s; yet, in accepting that, I mu&#8747;t not forget, that, though I at times experience har&#8747;h treatment from my aunt, under who&#8747;e care I am placed, till I become of age to be my own mi&#8747;tre&#8747;s, I am under obligations to her; and, though no authority &#8747;hall force me to an engagement again&#8747;t my own inclination, nor cruelty deprive me of the object of my affections, I will not buy my own happine&#8747;s at the expen&#8747;e of hers, nor &#8747;ee her expo&#8747;ed without re&#8747;enting it.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>How noble, to be thus folicitous for tho&#8747;e who are unmindful of our welfare! To &#8747;hield my&#8747;elf from the vain attacks of your aunt, has been the &#8747;ole motive for the&#8747;e transformations. To prevent her from expo&#8747;ing her&#8747;elf, you your&#8747;elf mu&#8747;t well know is impo&#8747;&#8747;ible. But if, in avoiding her attacks, and attempting to forward the great object of my happine&#8747;s, I &#8747;hould be guilty of di&#8747;honour or inju&#8747;tice, may I, as my puni&#8747;hment, bring down the mi&#8747;ery upon my own head, which I would have brought upon another.</p>

<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>To gain time to &#8747;ecure the affections and the hand of my Lydia. But, were my &#8747;ervant even to prevail upon your aunt to accept him, my life on it! the man has worth to a&#8747;pire to a nobler choice. He is my &#8747;ervant, and he is my friend.</p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>It is in your honour I confide.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>But I &#8747;hall take you, Lydia, only from one &#8747;trife to another, and from one tyranny to perhaps a greater re&#8747;traint. Can you bear the inconvenience and the tumult of a camp, and the uncertainty and hazard of joining your fate with a &#8747;oldier's?</p>

<p><i>1&#8747;t Ped. </i>That involves a great expen&#8747;e. But, in not having them, we have fewer troubles, and &#8747;ecure our independance. A hor&#8747;e requires care and attendance; he may knock up, he may fall lame: a &#8747;ervant will &#8747;carcely live upon le&#8747;s than a moderate gentleman; he will not perhaps &#8747;ubmit to the fatigue, he may impo&#8747;e upon you, he may cheat you, he may be impatient. Our own feelings tell us when we &#8747;hould re&#8747;t, and when we &#8747;hould go on; we carry the flight changes we want at our backs; we &#8747;tand in need of no other &#8747;ervice, and have no trouble nor inconvenience re&#8747;pecting our conveyance; <pb n="38"/> it is always ready when we are, and re&#8747;t repairs any flight injury it may undergo during the day, and they which carry us are always comfortably lodged when we are. Exerci&#8747;e &#8747;ecures appetite and &#8747;leep; the contemplation of the works of nature and of man affords amu&#8747;ement and exerci&#8747;e to the mind, and health re&#8747;ults from both.</p>

<p><i>Bob. </i>Quizical enough! travel for health and improvement! Why, I never care about either. Aunt gives about her, to be &#8747;ure; but I never look at any thing but the &#8747;tables and the larder. And what have you learnt, pray?</p>
<p><i>2d Ped. </i>We have learnt, Sir, that human nature is pretty much the &#8747;ame in every place and in every condition. All ranks have their plea&#8747;ures and their pains, their virtues and vices. My Lord ri&#8747;ks his guineas at faro, and the clown his halfpence at chuck. My Lord gets drunk with wine, and murders his friend in a duel; the clown gets intoxicated with ale, he quarrels with his pot companion, and breaks his rib, or beats out an eye in a boxing-bout; if he does not murder him, it is the difference of weapons, not the &#8747;uperior virtue of the clown,
<pb n="39"/>
which &#8747;pares him. Mi&#8747;s dances at the ball, and the next morning elopes with the captain; the country la&#8747;s dances her jog at the fair with her &#8747;weetheart, and the next morning has as little hone&#8747;ty as her &#8747;uperior in rank. My Lord profanes his &#8747;abbath at the card-table or the concert, the clown at to&#8747;&#8747;ing-up, or in the ale-house. If the <i>rich</i> do not <i>&#8747;eek</i> opportunities of doing good, the <i>poor neglect</i> them when they occur. It is certain we have all our vices, and I hope we have all &#8747;ome virtues.</p>
<p><i>Bob. </i>I &#8747;hould think now you might pick up &#8747;omething as you travel, by preaching from the top of a beer-barrel, or from a hollow tree. Come, I'll treat you with a bottle of wine a-piece, if you like it, and give you a bit of dinner into the bargain.</p>
<p><i>1&#8747;t Ped. </i>We thank you, Sir, for you offer, but beg leave to decline it.</p>
<p><i>Bob. </i>Well, I don't under&#8747;tand you together. Refu&#8747;e a bottle of wine! If you'd offer me two, I'd drink 'em both.</p>
<p><i>1&#8747;t Ped. </i>Every thing with us depends upon health, and we mu&#8747;t not ri&#8747;k that by intemperance. Nor is it for people in our &#8747;ituation to pay three &#8747;ixpence a bottle for wine. Without wine we can travel better; and, what is more, we can travel farther.</p>
<p><i>Bob. </i>Why, you &#8747;trave your&#8747;elves.</p>
<p><i>2d Ped. </i>That would be as bad, Sir. No, Sir, we live well; but plain: and in a draught of good ale we find more health and nouri&#8747;hment, than in the liquid fire retailed in bottles at an inn.</p>
<p><i>Bob. </i>Well, I find I can make nothing of you, and &#8747;o good bye. --Of all the quizzes I've ever &#8747;een, commend me to your pede&#8747;trians. <i>(A&#8747;ide, and exit.)</i></p>
<p><i>1&#8747;t Ped. </i>Well, Frank, we'll treat <i>our&#8747;elves</i> with a bit of dinner, and then for the wonders of Ke&#8747;wick.</p>
<p><i>2d Ped. </i>With all my heart.</p>

them! They remind me of the days of Arcadian innocence. The&#8747;e peaceful cots, &#8747;eque&#8747;tered in the gloom of beech and &#8747;ycamore, form an umbrageous land&#8747;cape, which, &#8747;et off by the umpurpling and downy hue of the clouds, with occa&#8747;ional interventions of gay gleams of light, are &#8747;o many circum&#8747;tances of imagery, which give a magical effect to the whole, well according with my &#8747;olemn tone of feeling at this moment. I am afraid, Sir Charles, I may be tautologous; but it is &#8747;carcely po&#8747;&#8747;ible, in repeated de&#8747;criptions, to avoid it. Pray, Mr. Botani&#8747;t, have you have of the <i>per&#8747;icaria &#8747;iliquo&#8747;a</i>, or <i>noli me tangere</i>, growing hereabouts? It is one of the few plants I am unacquainted with.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>The <i>touch me not!</i> It is found in great plenty near Windermere. It is a pity that your Lady&#8747;hip is &#8747;o entirely unacquainted with it, as it is a curious plant, and well worthy of your attention. --This, Madam, is the delightful village of Grange, celebrated for its ho&#8747;pitality to Mr. Gray; and this the gorge of Borrowdale, who&#8747;e terrible appearance intimidated him from exploring father the&#8747;e fine&#8747;t of &#8747;cenes.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Don't &#8747;peak, le&#8747;t the agitation of the air &#8747;hould loo&#8747;en the rocks about, and bring down a ma&#8747;s that would overwhelm us.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>Many a per&#8747;on, Madam, has brought ruin upon him&#8747;elf by &#8747;peaking, when he &#8747;hould have held his tongue. --And though ruin &#8747;hould hang over her head, &#8747;ooner than hold her tongue, a woman e'en lets it have its own way. <i>(A&#8747;ide.)</i></p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>A fine opportunity for a peep into pa&#8747;toral life, and an incident to &#8747;ecure Sir Charles's heart for ever. (<i>A&#8747;ide.</i>) Sir Charles, my heart beats in fond &#8747;ympathy with the innocence of the&#8747;e uncorrupted mountaineers-- </p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>Their innocence is of a very &#8747;ingular nature then. (<i>A&#8747;ide.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Speed. </i>Yes, &#8747;he always carries a tongue with her. (<i>A&#8747;ide.</i>)</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Give me your arm.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>You had better not give way to this amiable &#8747;en&#8747;ibility: let me lead you back to the hotel at Lowdore.</p>

<p><i>Speed. </i>It is &#8747;u&#8747;ceptible, I believe, of <i>twice</i> as much as any other. (<i>A&#8747;ide.</i>)</p>

<p>I DESIRES, Sir, you won't follow me about &#8747;o: I thought ye had been a gentleman; but, as ye be only a gentleman's gentleman, ye be not for my money, and I can a&#8747;&#8747;ure ye: be&#8747;ides, ye don't under&#8747;tand botamy.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>No, how &#8747;hould I?</p>
<p><i>Anna. </i>Oh, &#8747;uch an enlightened &#8747;tudy! &#8747;uch hard names! Why, do you know I was a whole day larning a &#8747;ingle word, and forgot it again the next morning. Another word, to be &#8747;ure, I larnt in an hour; but then I forgot it the next minute. But my mi&#8747;tre&#8747;s recollects every thing; &#8747;he is a great &#8747;chollard. Such curious truths too contained in it --why, plants are all men and women.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Aye, there are &#8747;weet-williams; I'm a &#8747;weet-william. And coxcombs, and painted ladies, and lords and ladies, and naked ladies, like your modern fine ladies, and--</p>
<p><i>Anna. </i>No, no, I mean that they drink and &#8747;leep, and are like man and wife.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>What, &#8747;leep in the &#8747;ame bed?</p>
<p><i>Anna. </i>Yes, and in different beds, and live &#8747;ometimes in different hou&#8747;es.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Have a &#8747;eparate <i>maintainance!</i> They mu&#8747;t be your fa&#8747;hionable plants then. What, and &#8747;ome have their mi&#8747;&#8747;es, I reckon, as well as their wives?</p>
<p><i>Anna. </i>Oh yes! a great many: and &#8747;ome ladies have their gallants too. </p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Upon my word, Mi&#8747;s, a very pretty &#8747;tudy this &#8747;eems to be that you've learnt: I can't &#8747;ay I &#8747;hould much like my wife to know any thing about it.</p>
<pb n="44"/>
<p><i>Anna. </i>That you'll find a difficult matter to get one who's ignorant of it; for all ladies that know any thing &#8747;tudy botamy now: and, if I hadn't de&#8747;pi&#8747;ed ye before, I do now for you ignorance.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>And yet, I don't know, I like her very well; and if &#8747;he'll make a good wife in other re&#8747;pects, I'll take care &#8747;he doesn't get to her gallants, and to living in a different hou&#8747;e.

<p><i>Anna. </i>I can't like nobody that isn't larned.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>It &#8747;eems to be the way to get wives by telling lies: I'm telling a lie by &#8747;aying I'm a &#8747;arvant, and one lie isn't wor&#8747;e than another. (<i>A&#8747;ide.</i>) Now &#8747;uppo&#8747;e I was really a gentleman, and only made my&#8747;elf a &#8747;arvant to &#8747;ee if I liked you? Suppo&#8747;e I was a baronet?</p>

<p><i>Sample. </i>And liked you better than &#8747;he, and &#8747;o told her I was a &#8747;arvant, to get away from her.</p>
<p><i>Anna. </i>Why, you don't &#8747;ay &#8747;o? And &#8747;he wouldn't have ye, becau&#8747;e ye was a &#8747;arvant? A proud minx!</p>

<p><i>Bob. </i>No; you tell your&#8747;elf &#8747;o. But you gave me the lie, and &#8747;hall fight me.</p>

<p><i>1&#8747;t Ped. </i>I am, Sir. I am afraid to break the laws of my country and my Maker.</p>

<p><i>1&#8747;t Ped. </i>A friend! You offered me a bottle of wine! Sir, for a true friend, nay, in a good cau&#8747;e, I would ri&#8747;k my life for my enemy; but I will not hazard it in being &#8747;econd in a duel.</p>
<p><i>Bob. </i>But he gave me the lie.</p>

<p><i>Ver. </i>Well Lydia, my dear, Sir Charles is obligingly gone with the botani&#8747;t to look for the <i>Geranium batrachoides</i>
<pb n="50"/>
<i>flore eleganter variegato</i>; he has promi&#8747;ed to get me two or three roots to put into pots, for me to take back for the garden at Diandria Hall. --A va&#8747;tly agreeable man is that Sir Charles. I don't think you admire him &#8747;o much as you did. You were quite enraptured with him at Lanca&#8747;ter, but now you &#8747;eem quite indifferent.</p>
<p><i>Lydia </i>You accu&#8747;ed me, Madam, of in&#8747;en&#8747;ibility towards the Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale, who brought us hither in his carriage.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>A very plea&#8747;ant and picture&#8747;que &#8747;cheme was that of Sir Charles. Yes, I had a mind to humour it, to give it effect. How ea&#8747;y, how polite, how enlightened is Sir Charles! how rich too in the language of botany! The &#8747;oul-expanding delight of an intercommunication of &#8747;entiments with Sir Charles, when put in contradi&#8747;tinction with the ob&#8747;curation of intellect in that prominently di&#8747;agreeable man, that <i>roturier</i>, his &#8747;ervant, is like the <i>ro&#8747;a provincialis</i> compared with the <i>allium ro&#8747;eum</i>.</p>
<p><i>Lydia </i>I have little reason to be partialto the gentleman, as he &#8747;eems to have no partiality to me. His attentions are directed at you, Madam. It remains with you, therefore, to encourage or oppo&#8747;e them.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Upon my word! a little jealous or &#8747;o! Sir Charles has di&#8747;cernment, Mi&#8747;s; and, if he prefers an enlightened mind to one not yet emerged from primitive darkne&#8747;s and prejudice, &#8747;urely he is to make his own election where he thinks proper.</p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>Certainly, Madam.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>And if Sir Charles would die, were I to be cruel, a truly philanthropic heart will bid him live to love and happine&#8747;s. Yes, you will, before very long, be niece to Lady Beccabunga Portin&#8747;cale; when the new plant the botani&#8747;t has found will be called the Portin&#8747;calia.</p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>If it is Sir Charles's and your wi&#8747;h, I have neither a right nor a cau&#8747;e to wi&#8747;h it otherwi&#8747;e.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Va&#8747;tly obliging indeed! But I have been &#8747;o pre&#8747;umptuous as ab&#8747;olutely to con&#8747;ent to the hymeneal union, without previou&#8747;ly a&#8747;king your permi&#8747;&#8747;ion.</p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>You are engaged, Madam?</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Beyond the po&#8747;&#8747;ibility of retreating, but with the con&#8747;ent of Sir Charles.</p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>I had no right to expect it; but perhaps, Madam, it might had been better had you con&#8747;ulted me.</p>
<pb n="51"/>
<p><i>Ver. </i>A&#8747;toni&#8747;hing impertinence! Yes, Mi&#8747;s, and you may, if you like it, for I give you my free leave, go and marry his &#8747;ervant; or, perhaps, I may give you leave to marry the botani&#8747;t. Yes, you may marry him.</p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>I thank you, Madam, for your goodne&#8747;s.</p>
<p align="center"><i>Enter</i> Anna.</p>
<p><i>Anna. </i>O dear, Madam, I mu&#8747;t beg your interpo&#8747;ance: there is going to be &#8747;uch a confu&#8747;ion of blood yonder.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Blood! Where?</p>
<p><i>Anna. </i>At the foot of Skiddaw.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>They could not have cho&#8747;en a more picture&#8747;que &#8747;ituation. But who is it?</p>
<p><i>Anna. </i>My young ma&#8747;ter.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Bob! A &#8747;illy blockhead! What bu&#8747;ine&#8747;s has he to be fighting? However, I'll introduce him in the foreground of a &#8747;ketch by way of a memorandum.</p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>Dear me, Madam, let us go: our pre&#8747;ence, the pre&#8747;ence of women, will prevent their proceeding to extremities.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Interfere in a duel! It would ab&#8747;olutely cla&#8747;s us among&#8747;t the <i>arums<ptr target="n8"/>:</i> we &#8747;hould be <i>ara maculata</i>.</p>
<note id="n8">Ma&#8747;culine ladies.</note>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>Con&#8747;ider, Madam, that by refu&#8747;ing our interference, where our pre&#8747;ence might prevent a duel, we become parties in it, and &#8747;hall have to reproach ourselves with any accident which may happen to either my cou&#8747;in Robert or his antagoni&#8747;t.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Methinks, Mi&#8747;s, you are a little too much gifted with <i>verbiage.</i> Be&#8747;ides, were I to honour their combat with my pre&#8747;ence, it would be, like one of the dam&#8747;els of former times, to honour the conqueror with my gracious &#8747;miles.</p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>How do you know but his antagoni&#8747;t may be Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale?</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Bob dare as &#8747;oon fight Tippoo Saib.</p>
<p><i>Anna. </i>It is, it is Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale.</p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>Heavens! Sir Charles! Perhaps it is only -- but the uncertainty is dreadful. <i>(A&#8747;ide.)</i> O let us ha&#8747;te this in&#8747;tant.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>How, Sir Charles! Lead me to the place. Oh, that I were <i>papilionaceous</i>.<ptr target="n8b"/> I run to his protection, and <pb n="52"/> let the fate-fraught tube di&#8747;charge its leaden death into my brea&#8747;t before it lodges in his manly heart.</p>
<note id="n8b">Flowers are called <i>papilionaceous</i> who&#8747;e petals are like the wings of a butterfly.</note> <!-- this note occurs over a page break -->

<p><i>2d Ped. </i>Not &#8747;o &#8747;oon, Sir. This mu&#8747;t not &#8747;top here.</p>
<p><i>Ver. (Without</i>) Bob! Bob! Bob! If you fire, I will di&#8747;inherit you. O Sir Chalres -- </p>
<head level="3" align="center"><i>Enters with</i> Lydia <i>and </i> Anna.</head>
<p>-- What, Bob and Speedwell! And has my inten&#8747;e &#8747;olicitude been about my booby of a nephew and this odious <i>bourgeois</i> of a &#8747;ervant> Provoking! --there, you may fight it out. (<i>Looking about her.</i>) A mo&#8747;t delightful &#8747;pot! The road hither was enchanting; passing through bowery lanes, luxuriant with beech, birch, mountain-a&#8747;h, and holly. --That <i>ravine</i> is extremely picture&#8747;que --that hill, covered with heath, turf, and brow&#8747;ing &#8747;heep --the road &#8747;erpenting under that gnarled oak, with its tinty foliage --tho&#8747;e beautiful boles, and that delicious di&#8747;tant dippy-dell --</p>
<head level="3" align="center">Sir Charles <i>and</i> Speedwell <i>come forward.</i></head>
<p>O my dear Sir Charles! I have had &#8747;uch multifarious palpitations on your account. (<i>To</i> Speedwell.)</p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>I was anxious, Sir Charles, for your &#8747;afety: though I tru&#8747;ted it was not you who was involved in the duel. (<i>To</i> Sir Charles.)</p>
<p><i>Anna. </i>I am all of a trimble, and all on your account, Sir Charles. (<i>To</i> Sample.)</p>
<p><i>Bob. </i>How do you do, Sir Charles? Are you pretty hearty? (<i>To</i> Sir Charles.)</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Hey! how is this! Sir Charles! Sir Charles! Sir Charles!</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Sir, I have witne&#8747;&#8747;ed your infamous conduct, and di&#8747;claim your acquaintance.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Why, what has he been doing?</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Was about to fire at his adver&#8747;ary with balls, when he had given him pi&#8747;tols with only powder in them.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>A poltroon! How unlike the picture&#8747;que virtues <pb n="56"/> of the ancients! when they met upon equal terms, &#8747;hook hands, and fought for honour and renown.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>This comes, Sir, of "&#8747;eeking the bubble reputation at the pi&#8747;tol's mouth."</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Bubble, indeed! for it is blown upon, and bur&#8747;t in air.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Sir Charles, as a military man, tell me what is to be done: for this &#8747;tory will get abroad, and I mu&#8747;t give a full and per&#8747;picacious account of it in my tour.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>It is not for me to &#8747;peak in this in&#8747;tance. I refer you to that gentleman.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>That gentleman!</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>If it were not for the pre&#8747;ence of the&#8747;e ladies, I should give you the cha&#8747;ti&#8747;ement due to a coward.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>I beg that may be no objection. Be&#8747;ides, by being witne&#8747;s to it, I can give a more authenticated enarration, and more fully explain the chain of cau&#8747;e and effect. Oh, Bob! Bob! He ought to be made to pa&#8747;s <i>sub jugum.</i></p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Have you nothing to &#8747;ay for your&#8747;elf, Sir?</p>
<p><i>Bob. </i>No: I am &#8747;piflicated!</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Withdraw. Your own de&#8747;picable cowardice, and the pre&#8747;ence of the&#8747;e ladies, alone prevent me from giving you the caning you merit.</p>
<p><i>Bob. </i>I am much obliged to the ladies and my&#8747;elf.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Bob, you don't enter my Sociable again.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>No; he's not a &#8747;ociable man.</p>
<p><i>Bob. </i>I've no re&#8747;ource left but to turn tail upon the world, declaim against its vices, and &#8747;et up my&#8747;elf as a pattern of every thing that's great and good.</p>
<p align="right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Pray, Mr. Speedwell, how came you engaged in a duel with my nephew? Was it a duel prepen&#8747;ed, or a fortuitous colli&#8747;ion?</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>Matters, Madam, are too much involved at this moment to be but partially adju&#8747;ted. That gentleman's name is not Speedwell, nor is he a &#8747;ervant. He is a TRAVELLER, with whom I by chance changed cloathes, and who, having his own pur&#8747;uits interrupted, by my having his articles of trade, a&#8747;&#8747;umed the name and title of Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale, thinking therewith to make his fortune.</p>
<pb n="57"/>
<p><i>Ver. </i>What! I have been made love to by a bagman? --What a heterogeneous impre&#8747;&#8747;ion!</p>
<p><i>Anna. </i>(<i>A&#8747;ide.</i>) Then this wretch is no better than a &#8747;arvant.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>I am the real Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale, who, under&#8747;tanding you always in&#8747;i&#8747;ted upon your niece re&#8747;igning her claims with any admirer to you, acquie&#8747;ced in his &#8747;cheme, and pa&#8747;&#8747;ed my&#8747;elf upon you as the guide and botani&#8747;t, to e&#8747;cape your attacks, and have an opportunity of farthering my intentions with your niece. But, Mr. Sample, failing to per&#8747;onate the character, I made him my &#8747;ervant upon you as my&#8747;elf. Your niece has kindly conde&#8747;cended to be mine; and, having an opportunity of declaring my&#8747;elf, I now claim your forgivene&#8747;s and con&#8747;ent.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Impo&#8747;&#8747;ible!</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Now the whole truth's out.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>It is all very true.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Yes, Mr. Botani&#8747;t, this is a <i>cryptogamy</i>, which I have not &#8747;een before, and had no idea of. Sir, you have not my con&#8747;ent, and Lydia will never have one farthing of mine.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>My Lydia is her&#8747;elf a trea&#8747;ure of which no fortune can enhance the value. A few months will make her her own mi&#8747;tre&#8747;s; and we need not then be beholden to your con&#8747;ent for our union.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Then my con&#8747;ent is held to be merely ad&#8747;cititious. But, Sir, there are exacerbations of the mind which--</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>I mu&#8747;t again appeal to your amiable forgiving kinde&#8747;s for this &#8747;econd deceit practi&#8747;ed again&#8747;t you. But perhaps your Lady&#8747;hip was not deceived in this in&#8747;tance.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Not a particle more than I was the fir&#8747;t time.</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>May I hope it was my&#8747;elf, and not my a&#8747;&#8747;umed title, that gained a heart which monarchs might proudly &#8747;igh for?</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>No, Sir, your in&#8747;iduous flame--</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>May I then be permitted to remind you of a bond, which lately, with &#8747;eductive &#8747;impers, you were plea&#8747;ed to force upon me?</p>
<pb n="58"/>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Something extremely picture&#8747;que in this man and his conduct; he has roughne&#8747;s, &#8747;udden variation and intricacy; and if he were not a &#8747;ervant --(<i>A&#8747;ide.</i>)</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>(<i>Reads.</i>) "I, Beccabunga Veronica, of Diandria Hall, do pledge m&#8747;elf to marry the bearer, under forfeiture of all my e&#8747;tate, my <i>hortus &#8747;iccus</i>, &#8747;ketches and writings. Given under my hand this day 21&#8747;t day of--."</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>But you are not Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale. I &#8747;till abide by the forfeiture, if I refu&#8747;e to marry Sir Charles Portin&#8747;cale. Now what have you to &#8747;ay?</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>That the bond is made out to the bearer; and Sir Charles &#8747;hall exact it as he thinks be&#8747;t. (<i>Gives it</i> Sir Charles.)</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>My Lydia &#8747;hall di&#8747;po&#8747;e of it at her plea&#8747;ure.</p>
<p><i>Lydia. </i>I have no wi&#8747;h to enforce the penalty. It is yours, Madam. (<i>Gives it to</i> Veronica.)</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Quite a <i>capriccio</i>, I declare. And &#8747;o, Sir Charles, you ab&#8747;olutely refu&#8747;e me?</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>I cannot accept you my&#8747;elf, and I dare not recommend you to my &#8747;hadow.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>I fear I &#8747;hall never get another offer half &#8747;o good, and I'm determined not "to wither on the virgin thorn." (<i>A&#8747;ide.</i>) He's a va&#8747;tly clever man, he's a botani&#8747;t, he's picture&#8747;que --I'll throw a Gilpin tint over him. (<i>Looks through gla&#8747;s.</i>) Yes, he's gorgeou&#8747;ly glowing. I mu&#8747;t not view him with the other lights, for a hu&#8747;band &#8747;hould not be either glaringly gloomy, or frigidly frozen; nor &#8747;hould I like to be haunted by a blue devil. --Then he's a &#8747;ervant -- but Lord Level married his daughter to a &#8747;ervant. I think the incident would be picture&#8747;que; and it would be perfectly botanic for Veronica and Speedwell to marry.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>I will an&#8747;wer for his honour, and &#8747;hall be happy to own him as a relation. I have proved the confidence I place in him, by a&#8747;&#8747;igning him the ta&#8747;k of being my repre&#8747;entative.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>But &#8747;hall not I get laugh --No, a woman in my &#8747;ituation may act as &#8747;he plea&#8747;es. We authore&#8747;&#8747;es are privileged people. But how much will my condition be apejorated. Pray, are you really a botani&#8747;t? Is it your &#8747;pecific character? or was your botanic knowledge merely a&#8747;&#8747;umptuous?</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>What little knowledge I di&#8747;played was really my own, and I hope to better it under your in&#8747;tructions.</p>
<pb n="59"/>
<p><i>Ver. </i>A very hopeful &#8747;cholar, truly!</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>May I then hope you will marry me?</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>Marry will I! We will be <i>connate</i> like the twin flowers on the &#8747;ame <i>peduncle</i>, and I tru&#8747;t our love will be <i>&#8747;empervirent</i> and <i>perennial</i>. But Mr. --What's your name?</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Sample, Mi&#8747;s.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>You are an exce&#8747;&#8747;ively bad practioner of the mimetic art, you have no artificiality; but as we all seem to be <i>Dichotamous</i><ptr target="n9"/>, I &#8747;uppo&#8747;e you will marry my maid and amanuen&#8747;is, Anna Katharina?</p>
<note id="n9">Branching off in pairs.</note>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Who caught a mou&#8747;e, Mi&#8747;s?</p>
<p><i>Speed. </i>I wonder &#8747;he has not &#8747;ometime &#8747;melt a rat.</p>
<p><i>Sample. </i>Why, I &#8747;hould like her well enough, and, if &#8747;he'll have a &#8747;ide in my gig, I'll drive her home, and we'll &#8747;et up a &#8747;hop for our&#8747;elves.</p>
<p><i>Anna. </i>Yes, but I'd rather you'd been a baronet.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>But where are the two gentlemen who came as &#8747;econds to you and your adver&#8747;ary?</p>
<p><i>1&#8747;t Ped. </i>Here, Sir. We but undertook the bu&#8747;ine&#8747;s to prevent any mi&#8747;chief from en&#8747;uing. We have &#8747;ucceeded and are &#8747;ati&#8747;fied.</p>
<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>May I reque&#8747;t to know your names and conditions? Your words do not accord with your outward appearance. </p>
<p><i>1&#8747;t Ped. </i>We tru&#8747;t, Sir, that we are gentlemen, though thus habited, and taking our tour on foot to gain a knowledge of our country and of mankind.</p>
<p><i>Ver. </i>How fortunate! Pede&#8747;trians! How picture&#8747;que too their appearance --Another incident for my tour. I beg, Gentlemen, we may be better acquainted. I have often heard of the many who travel in this rational way, but was never before &#8747;o fortunate as to be acquainted with any. Let me entreat you to be <i>aggregated</i> into our party at the inn; and, if I may be &#8747;o bold as to entreat a &#8747;light account of your hi&#8747;tory, to in&#8747;ert in my tour, I &#8747;hall be particularly obligated to you. -- I &#8747;carce know, Sir Charles, in what manner we are to be cla&#8747;&#8747;ed; but as we are &#8747;o many <i>flo&#8747;cules</i> compo&#8747;ing one compound <i>flos</i>, I will pronounce us <i>&#8747;yngenecious</i>, of the order <i>polygamia aqualis</i>, except the Pede&#8747;trians, who &#8747;eem to be as a <i>modadelphia</i><ptr target="n10"/></p>
<note id="n10">One brotherhood.</note>

<p><i>Sir Charles. </i>All di&#8747;gui&#8747;e being thus thrown off, however our follies may be laughed at, I tru&#8747;t that the adventures of the LAKERS at Ke&#8747;wick will afford an innocent amu&#8747;ement to tho&#8747;e who become acquainted with them, and that none of us will have any cau&#8747;e to lament their <i>denouement.</i></p>
