<p><s id="s15">The local knowledge here communicated, will not affect, much less prevent, the agreeable surprise that attends the first sight of scenes that surpass all description, and of objects which affect the mind of the spectator only in the highest degree.</s></p>

<p><s id="s20">Such as spend their lives in cities, and their time in crowds, will here meet with contrasts that enlarge the mind, by contemplation of sublime objects, and raise it from nature, to nature's first cause.</s> <s id="s21">Whoever takes a walk with a sense of the creator's power and unlearnable wisdom, in heaping moountains upon mountains, and enthroning rocks upon rocks.</s> <s id="s22">Such exhibitions of sublime and beautiful objects surprise and please, exciting at once rapture and reverence.</s></p>
