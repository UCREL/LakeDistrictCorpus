<p><s id="s698">There is no cloud that possesses a more distinct outline than this, and none which exhibits more brilliant effects of light.</s> <s id="s699">As a weather-prognosticator it is best observed at a distance, and near the horizon, when the form of the summit may be more exactly discerned.</s></p>
<p><s id="s700">We now consider the Anvil Cloud.</s></p>
<p><s id="s701">This species, alluded to by Sir John Herschell in his' Familiar Lectures on Science,' cannot be regarded as so strictly a form of cumulus as that which we have just noticed, inasmuch as it exhibits at times a great tendency to the form of stratus, and ocassionally to that if cirrus; or, perhaps we should rather say, to the form of cumulo-cirrus.</s> <s id="s702">As an indicator of wind, this cloud may probably be regarded as unrivalled.</s> <s id="s703">It frequently appears two or three days before heavy gales, especially when they are of long duration, as about the Equinoxes.</s> <s id="s704">Without being hypercritical, we may distinguish three varieties of the cloud, the outlines of which are characteristic.</s> <s id="s705">The first variety possesses greater affinity for ordinary cumulus than the other two, and it often shows great resemblance in many points to the electric cumulus.</s> <s id="s706">It occurs for the most part in large masses or banks, the summits of which as it drifts along with the wind, stand out in sharp relief against the upper sky, and exhibit the most striking and fantastic resemblances to terrestrial objects, beetling crags, towers, and heads of animals-- the last being of frequent occurrence.</s> <s id="s707">When of this variety, the anvial cloud appears to be highly condensed, and is of a dark bluish or slatey tint.</s> <s id="s708">It is generally, I believe the precursor of heavy rain as well as wind.</s></p>
<p> <s id="s709">This cloud, also an excellent indicator of wind, does not appear to have received the attention it deserves from meteorologists.</s> <s id="s710">The reader must not confound it with cirro-cumulus.</s></p>
<p><s id="s711">The second variety of the cloud, which approaches to stratus, exhibits a more irregularly formed' anvil,' the' waist' being usually much more conspicuous on one side than on the other.</s> <s id="s712">This is also a dense cloud, without much marking on its surface, the outline being not nearly so irregular as that of the variety just described.</s> <s id="s713">It is of a lighter tint, gray or muddy bluish, and does not, I think, occur in an isolated form, but rises from a bank of lower stratus or cumulo-stratus.</s> <s id="s714">It is also a wet-weather cloud.</s></p>
<p><s id="s715">The third variety is a kind of aggregated cirrus, generally of dark tint, and seen at high altitudes in windy weather.</s> <s id="s716">This lacks the consistency and volume of ordinary cumulus, and spreads itself out almost in a sheet, with rounded edges, and without surface marking.</s></p>
<p><s id="s717">The year 1872 was remarkable both for its excessive rainfall and the number and destructive violence of its thunderstorms.</s> <s id="s718">It was equally remarkable for the variety and striking character of its cloud forms.</s> <s id="s719">The electric cumulus was scarcely absent for a day during the whole period over which the thunderstorms extended.</s> <s id="s720">On one occasion, when leaving <enamex sw="w106012" long="-2.878238320350647" lat="53.5225887298584" type="ppla" gazref="unlock:14131229" name="Liverpool" conf="2.534224382">Liverpool</enamex> for <enamex sw="w106026" long="-2.442907333374023" lat="53.69835090637207" type="civila" gazref="unlock:14121829" name="Blackburn with Darwen" conf="2.403663328">Blackburn</enamex>, I observed three or four conical piles of the cloud upon the horizon in the direction of the latter town; the weather was beautiful at <enamex sw="w106173" long="-2.878238320350647" lat="53.5225887298584" type="ppla" gazref="unlock:14131229" name="Liverpool" conf="2.534224382">Liverpool</enamex>, but a storm, as I learnt on arriving at my destination, had raged there at the time I observed the cloud so many miles away.</s></p>

<p> <s id="s814">See remarks below on the relative height of different species of cloud.</s></p>
<p><s id="s815">This kind of cloud frequently forms in enormous masses, as may be seen from its great altitude, and the manner in which the sheet extends towards the horizon; but, though much flatter in form than most varieties of cumulus, its surface is often broken or nodulous, like that of hail cumulus or electric cumulus when these are ready to discharge their contents.</s> <s id="s816">The peculiar form of this species is probably due in part to the saturated condition of the lower atmosphere at the time of its occurrence, and I have given to it the special designation of eraing cumulus to indicate the excessively wet weather that it is generally associated with.</s></p>
<p><s id="s817">One of the most remarkable facts in connection with atmospheric phenomena is this-that certain characteristic forms of cloud find their habitat within a certain zone, or at certain distances from the earth's surface.</s> <s id="s818">Omitting stratus, we find them usually in the following order, ascending from the earth:( i.) Cumulus;( ii.) Cirro Cumulus;( iii) Cirrus.</s> <s id="s819">The second of these appears to be a intermediate stage between cirrus, the ice-cloud in its normal state, and cumulus; or between cirrus and nimbus; and it has a very great range of altitude.</s> <s id="s820">Thus it might appear to be an exception to the law-- that form depends partly on elevation; but it will, I think, be admitted that, as a general rule, it occupies a region lying between that of the other two species.</s> <s id="s821">But besides altitude there are doubtless relations existing between the banks of cloud themselves which affect the question of form.</s> <s id="s822">This especially would be the case where there was strong interchange of electrical action.</s></p>
<p><s id="s823">But whatever may be the cause of the law we speak of, this fact deserves attention, that any decided deviation from the law is significant of a disturbed condition of the atmosphere, and often is indicative of approaching storms.</s> <s id="s824">Let us take two cases to illustrate this; in very thundery weather the two great types of cloud show a tendency to interchange their places in regard to altitude; that is to say, cumulus rises to an abnormal height, and cirrus descends to an unusually low position.</s> <s id="s825">This may generally be verified by watching the course of a thunderstorm; when the peaks of the first - mentioned cloud may often be observed at a great distance thrusting their pale yellow pinnacles into the azure of the heavens, long before the first muttering of the storm is heard, and while the mass of cloud is far beyond the horizon.</s> <s id="s826">On the other hand, when the hurly-burly is over and the rain has ceased, masses of nimbo-cirrus may at times be seen throwing up their silvery crests, and curling over the earth like gigantic breakers.</s> <s id="s827">This last-mentioned appearance, which has a splendid effect, is, I believe, never seen except in thundery weather, or rather during electrical disturbance, and it is not easy to account for the existence of such forms by the action of wind.</s> <s id="s828">The last remark applied also to what we may call' star' cirrus; that is, cirrus streaks radiating from a common centre in all directions( a form of cloud also connected with thunderstorms), and to that form which resembles the feathering of an arrow, parallel rays running both sides of a common axis.</s></p>
<p> <s id="s829">Observations made continually during many years since this law of interchange of altitudes was first noticed by me in the Popular Science Review, have fully confirmed the truth of the foregoing remarks concerning its relation to atmospheric disturbance.</s></p>
<p><s id="s830">' We shall have stormy weather, sir; those animal clouds have been seen again to-day.'</s> <s id="s831">Such was the remark made to me by a countrywoman in <enamex  sw="w123525" name="Large admin unit">Kent</enamex>, and this observation was true enough to nature; it agreed also with my own notes at the time on the appearance of' anvil cloud,' or fracto-cumulus.</s> <s id="s832">' Ram's - head' cloud might not inappropriately be the term used to describe this drifting bank of hail or rain, which often marks the sky with such striking and fantastic outlines.</s> <s id="s833">Observe these dark rolling masses at sunset on an autumn afternoon, and see what kind of weather the night brings with it-- driving sleet and sudden gusts of wind, with' bursts' of hail rising often to a furious and full-blown nor' wester, which make one thankful for a good roof overhead.</s></p>
<p><s id="s834">The general form and type of the' hail cloud' is pretty well known to observers of atmospheric phenomena.</s> <s id="s835">In most cases it greatly resembles the snow-cumulus, though generally more craggy in outline, harder in its edges, and more attended by stratus at its base.</s> <s id="s836">There are, however, several types of snow-cloud.</s> <s id="s837">When drifting against a clear sky, the latter presents a more fleecy and softer edging, though in its general form it must be grouped, like that which originates hail-showers, with the class of' animal' cloud, i.e., condensed fracto-cumulus.</s> <s id="s838">Both of these are again closely akin to the electric cumulus or cone cloud( see Science Gossip for July, 1879).</s> <s id="s839">Here we ought to note the frequent connection existing between the hail-shower and electrical discharges, and the part that electricity is known to play in the condensation and cohesion of the watery particles.</s></p>

<p><s id="s1205">Compared with the greatest works of man, the mountains are indeed everlasting; but moss and raindrop, snow and storm are surely though slowly, bringing down their pride to the valleys beneath; it is the Lord alone who endureth throughout all generations, and who changeth the face of nature as a garment.</s> <s id="s1206">It is the Lord only who is a sure refuge for the oppressed from all their enemies, their castle to which they may continually resort.</s> <s id="s1207">Pure, indeed, and refreshing are the streams that well forth from the solitudes of the might hills, but those who drink of their waters shall thirst again.</s> <s id="s1208">The Lord alone is that Eternal Rock from which floweth the water of life, the perennial streams of which, if a man drink, he shal live for ever.</s></p>
