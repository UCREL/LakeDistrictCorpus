<p><s id="s12">This volume is intended to combine the accuracy of a Guide Book with the liveliness and interest of a Personal Narrative.</s> <s id="s13">It contains all and more than all the information usually given in the former, but so arranged as to fall naturally into the latter.</s> <s id="s14">Avoiding the dry and didactic form of the Gazetteer Guide, the Author has aimed to produce a readable volume, which may at once serve as a pleasant Companion in the carriage, the boat, or the inn, and afford the best practical directions to tourists; by giving an actual exemplification of the manner in which the Tour of the Lakes has been accomplished both by a Family Party and by an individual.</s> <s id="s15">From this the traveller will receive a distinct view of the most advantageous method of making each excursion,-- of the time consumed, the accommodations of inconveniences experienced, and the precautions to be taken.</s> <s id="s16"><enamex sw="w1769" long="-1.77831968367031" lat="54.08503022708322" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:11189841" name="Ladies Riggs" conf="1.6">Ladies</enamex>, in particular, will learn what enterprises they may safely attempt in the mountainous region, and whence they would be exposed to danger or excessive fatique.</s></p>
<p><s id="s17">Much of the information concerning the objects seen, the families and distinguished men residing at the Lakes, the manners and customs of the inhabitants, and the history and antiquities of the district, is conveyed in the form of conversion; but, although this has frequently been adopted, as the most agreemable method of communicating facts, the Author has never exercised his invention or imagination as to the facts themselves, but has in all cases scrupulously confined himself within the strictest bounds of truth.</s></p>
<p><s id="s18">The Family Tour is a narrative of a Tour actually performed by a Family Party, consisting of two ladies and two gentlemen; the journeys were made as they are described; and the incidents, with a few trifling exceptions, occurred just as they are related.</s></p>
