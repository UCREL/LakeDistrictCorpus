<p><s id="s882">Different portions of the earth's surface, and consequently the contiguous portions of air, are differently heated by the sun's rays impinging upon them in different degrees of obliquity; and this difference is naturally much greater in a mountainous than in a champaign country; and on two portions of air thus unequally heated, being intermixed one with the other, either by the ascent of the warmer and consequently lighter part, or by the ordinary current of the wind, the vapour assumes a visible form.</s></p>

<p><s id="s891">On the disappearance of the sun in a clear evening, a mist is sometimes observed over a piece of moist ground; where it seems to be formed, and for some time kept afloat, by a kind of contention between the heated surface of the earth below it, and the colder atmosphere above; but the earth not continuing to afford the necessary supply of heat, the conflict ceases; and the vapour settles upon the grass in the shape of dew.</s></p>

<p><s id="s907">After an absence of eight years, it emerged on the 20th of July 1808, and increased in size till it might be about 80 yards in length, its height above water being about a foot; and although the depth of water in the lake was variable, yet for some weeks the island preserved nearly the same dimensions.</s> <s id="s908">It appeared to sink gradually till the beginning of October, when it became wholly covered with water.</s> <s id="s909">Its next appearance was on the 7th of September, 1813: but it was then of smaller dimensions; being only about 12 yards in length: yet, when in consequence of rain the surface of the lake rose above three feet in height, the island was buoyed up along with it, and was not entirely submerged before the end of October.</s> <s id="s910">It emerged again on the 6th of August, 1815; and on the 21st of that month it measured 88 yards in length, and in some places 25 in breadth; part of it remained above water, from that time till the first of September.</s> <s id="s911">And again in 1819 it appeared above water from the 14th of August to the end of that month.</s> <s id="s912">In 1824, after a fit of warm, dry weather, a small portion of it appeared on the 1st of June, being the earliest ever remembered; yet it never attained its full size, although it remained in part above water till the end of September.</s></p>
<p><s id="s913">Various solutions have been offered for this phenomenon: some assuming water, and others air, as the principal agent in its production; but many of those attempts to account for its appearance, have been founded upon an incorrect description of the premises.</s> <s id="s914">In a Survey of the lakes, published by James Clarke in 1789, he says, it never appears but when the lake is swelled with rain; and then describes a mountain torrent called <enamex sw="w154938" long="-1.897574659799038" lat="54.26702610192719" type="water" gazref="unlock:8784808" name="Cat Gill" conf="1.4">Cat Gill</enamex>, which pours down a rock opposite the island, and before it reaches the lake disappears among the stones and gravel at the foot of the hill.</s> <s id="s915">This water he supposes to run to some distance under the lake, and that by its action upwards" it raises the turf into a convex form, and during the continuance of the torrent, gives it the appearance of an island."</s> <s id="s916">But even supposing that this water could be conveyed so far underneath the lake, the surface of the earth in this part always presents cracks and openings sufficient to admit of its being discharged without difficulty; besides that, on referring to a journal of the weather, it will be found, that every instance of its rising within the last twenty years, has happened when the lake was low, and not swelled with rain-- as Mr. Clarke had premised.</s></p>
<p><s id="s917">In the year 1808, during the time the island remained above water, various theories were presented to the public through the medium of the <enamex sw="w155893" long="-2.923743724822998" lat="54.89435005187988" type="ppla" gazref="unlock:14127466" name="Carlisle" conf="3.372226797">Carlisle</enamex> Journal.</s> <s id="s918">When not concurring in any of those previously advanced, I offered my opinion thus:" Perhaps the carburetted hydrogen gas usually found at the bottom of stagnant water, may be produced here in greater quantity than in other parts of the lake; and probably this production may be increased by heat.</s> <s id="s919">Probably too by reason of springs underneath, the upper stratum of earth may not be so firmly attached to its bed; and the surface of the earth in the bottom of the lake, being closely interwoven with the roots of aquatic plants, prevents the escape of the gas, till the uppermost stratum of earth, being charged therewith, is raised from its bed: and the water gradually gaining admission underneath, easily bears it up, so long as the earth contains air enough to make its specific gravity less than that of water-- but when by exposure to the sun and wind, the earth becomes discharged of its gas, it gradually sinks to its old bed, to remain till a sufficient quantity is again accumulated."</s></p>
<p><s id="s920">It would be tedious to enumerate all the different theories, which have been from time to time proposed to account for this phenomenon, with the arguments for and against each.</s> <s id="s921">It may be sufficient to notice the following.</s></p>
<p><s id="s922">Some have ascribed its origin to those internal commotions by which earthquakes and volcanoes are produced.</s> <s id="s923">Some suppose, with Mr. Clarke, that the subterranean passage of the stream before alluded to, may be continued to the place where the island appears, and that its usual aperture being in a dry season choked up, the increased pressure on the swelling of the brook by rain, may elevate the island.</s> <s id="s924">Others say, that the water in its fall down the rock being beat into a foam, a quantity of air, thus mechanically mixed with the water, may be conveyed underneath, and that this air on its disengagement may force up the earth along with it.</s> <s id="s925">Others again suppose, that the alluvia of vegetable matter may in this manner be carried underneath, and by its decomposition a quantity of hydrogen gas capable of producing this effect, may be evolved.</s> <s id="s926">And while one imagines that carburetted hydrogen, sufficient to elevate this mass of earth, may be produced by the decomposition of pyrites, supposed to be placed underneath it; another, not caring to enter so deeply into the subject, thinks the air contained in the cellular leaves of the plants growing upon the island, may be sufficient to give it buoyancy.</s></p>
<p><s id="s927">One material circumstance has however generally escaped observation: namely, that the air to which the rising of this island has been attributed, is not collected in a body underneath it; but interspersed through the whole mass: not causing it to float" as a reversed saucer would in a bowl of water;" but by enlarging its bulk, and thereby diminishing its specific gravity.</s> <s id="s928">And the most rational conclusion seems to be, that air or gas is generated in the body of the island by decomposition of the vegetable matter of which it is formed; and this gas being produced most copiously, as well as being more rarefied in hot weather, the earth at length becomes so much distended therewith, as to render the mass of less weight than an equal bulk of water.</s> <s id="s929">The water then insinuating itself between the substratum of clay and the peat earth forming the island, bears it to the surface, where it continues for a time, till partly by escape of the gas, partly by its absorption by water, and partly by its condensation consequent on a decrease of heat, the volume is reduced; and the earth gradually sinks to its former level, where it rests till successive increments of gas again render it buoyant.</s></p>
<p><s id="s930">But as the vegetable matter of which the island is principally composed, appears to have been amassed at a remote period, when the lake has been of less depth than at the present; and very little addition recently made by the plants now growing upon the spot; it is reasonable to suppose that the process furnishing the gas cannot from the same materials be continued ad infinitum: but that there must be a time when it shall have arrived at its maximum; after which the eruptions will become less extensive or less frequent.</s></p>

<p><s id="s946">Formerly this mine was worked only at intervals, and when a sufficient quantity had been procured to supply the demand for a few years, it was strongly closed up until the stock was reduced; but of late, it has been obtained less plentifully, and the demand being greater, the working has been continued for several years successively.</s></p>
<p><s id="s947">Bishop Nicholson, who visited this mine in 1710, says, in a letter to Dr. Woodward, that" on opening the old level in that year, great discouragements appeared, for no search having been made in thirty - two years, they found that some pilfering interlopers had carried it on till they had lost it in the rocks; but after a few days' trial a new belly was happily discovered before the forehead of the <enamex sw="w166135" long="-3.12208" lat="54.37042" type="other" gazref="unlock:4565407" name="Old Man of Coniston" conf="2">Old Man</enamex>, which proved so rich, that in less than twenty - four hours they had filled several sacks with fine and clean washed-mineral."</s> <s id="s948">An old level, which was re-opened in 1769, was found to have been cut through this very hard rock, without the help of gunpowder; and a kind of pipe vein which had produced a great quantity of wad, having been pursued to the depth of one hundred yards and upwards, much inconvenience was experienced in working it: to obviate which, in 1798, an adit, or level was begun in the side of the hill, which at the length of 220 yards communicates with the bottom of the former sinking; since which time the works have been carried on internally through various ramifications; a survey of which has lately been made by Mr. Farey.</s> <s id="s949">Through this principal level the water now passes off, and the produce and rubbish are brought out upon a rail-way in a small waggon; and over its mouth a house is built, where, when the mine is open, the overseers dwell, and the workmen are undressed and examined as they pass through it on leaving their work.</s></p>
<p><s id="s950">Owing to the great value of this mineral, and the facilities afforded for disposing of it in an unmanufactured state, the greatest precaution has sometimes been scarcely sufficient to keep the workmen from pilfering, and even those appointed to overlook them have not always escaped suspicion; yet, it is but justice to the present manager, Mr. William Dixon, to state, that for upwards of fifty years that he has been employed, he has always sustained an unimpeachable character.</s></p>
