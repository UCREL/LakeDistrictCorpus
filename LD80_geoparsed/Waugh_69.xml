<p><s id="s2946">This homely, pure-hearted, old country parson, with all his frugal thrift, devoted no small share of what he saved from such humble resources, to the liberal education of his numerous family; and he was, also," even munificent in hospitality as a parish priest."</s> <s id="s2947">" Every Sunday were served, upon the long table at which he has been described sitting with a child upon his knee, messes of broth, for the refreshment of those of his congregation who came from a distance, and usually took their seats as part of his own household.</s> <s id="s2948">It seems scarcely possible that this custom could have commenced before the augmentation of his cure; and what would to many have been a high price of self-denial, was paid, by the pastor and his family, for this gratification; as the treat could only be provided by dressing at one time the whole, perhaps, of their weekly allowance of fresh animal food; consequently, for a succession of days, the table was covered with cold victuals only.</s></p>
<p><s id="s2949">" He loved old customs and old usages, and in some instances stuck to them to his own loss; for, having had a sum of money lodged in the hands of a neighbouring tradesman, when long course of time had raised the rate of interest, and more was offered, he refused to accept it; an act not difficult to one, who, while he was drawing seventeen pounds a-year from his curacy, declined, as we have seen, to add the profits of another small benefice to his own, lest he should be suspected of cupidity.</s> <s id="s2950">From this vice he was utterly free; he made no charge for teaching his school; such as could afford to pay gave him what they pleased.</s> <s id="s2951">When very young, having kept a diary of his expenses, however trifling, the large amount at the end of the year surprised him, and from that time the rule of this life was to be economical, not avaricious.</s> <s id="s2952">At his decease he left behind him no less a sum than £ 2000; and such a sense of his various excellences was prevalent in the country, that the epithet of Wonderful is to this day attached to his name.</s></p>
<p><s id="s2953">" There is in the above sketch something so extraordinary as to require further explanatory details: and to begin with his industry, eight hours in each day, during five days in the week, and half of Saturday, except when the labours of husbandry were urgent, he was occupied in teaching.</s> <s id="s2954">His seat was within the rails of the altar; the communion table was his desk, and, like Shenstone's schoolmistress, the master employed himself at the spinning-wheel, while the children were repeating their lessons by his side.</s> <s id="s2955">Every evening after school hours, if not more profitably engaged, he continued the same kind of labour, exchanging, for the benefit of exercise, the small wheel at which he had sate for the large one on which wool is spun, the spinner stepping to a fro.</s> <s id="s2956">Thus was the wheel constantly in readiness to prevent the waste of a moment's time.</s> <s id="s2957">Nor was his industry with the pen, when occasion called for it, less eager.</s> <s id="s2958">Intrusted with extensive management of public and private affairs, he acted, in his rustic neighbourhood, as scrivener, writing out petitions, deeds of conveyance, wills, covenants, etc., with pecuniary gain to himself, and to the great benefit of his employers.</s> <s id="s2959">These labours( at all times considerable), at one period of the year, viz., between Christmas and Candlemas, when money transactions are settled in this country, were often so intense, that he passed great part of the night, and sometimes whole nights, at his desk.</s> <s id="s2960">His garden also was tilled by his own hand; he had a right of pasturage upon the mountains for a few sheep and a couple of cows, which required his attendance; with this pastoral occupation he joined the labours of husbandry upon a small scale, renting two or three acres in addition to his own, less than one acre of glebe; and the humblest drudgery which the cultivation of these fields required was performed by himself.</s></p>
<p><s id="s2961">" He also assisted his neighbours in hay-making and shearing their flocks, and in the performance of the latter service he was eminently dexterous.</s> <s id="s2962">They, in their turn, complimented him with the present of a hay-cock or a fleece; less as a recompense for this particular service than as a general acknowledgement.</s> <s id="s2963">The Sabbath was in a strict sense kept holy, the Sunday evenings being devoted to reading the scripture and family prayer.</s> <s id="s2964">The principal festivals appointed by the church were also duly observed; but through every other day in the week, through every week in the year, he was incessantly occupied in work of hand or mind; not allowing a moment for recreation, except upon a Saturday afternoon, when he indulged himself with a newspaper, or sometimes with a magazine.</s> <s id="s2965">The frugality and temperance established in his house were as admirable as the industry.</s> <s id="s2966">Nothing to which the name of luxury could be given was there known; in the latter part of his life, indeed, when tea had been brought into almost general use, it was provided for visitors, and for such of his own family as returned occasionally to his roof, and had been accustomed to this refreshment elsewhere; but neither he nor his wife ever partook of it.</s> <s id="s2967">The raiment worn by his family was comely and decent, but as simple as their diet; the homespun materials were made up into apparel by their own hands.</s> <s id="s2968">A the time of the decease of this thrifty pair, their cottage contained a large store of webs of woollen and linen cloth, woven from thread of their own spinning; and it is remarkable that the pew in the chapel in which the family used to sit, remains neatly lined with woollen cloth spun by the pastor's own hands.</s> <s id="s2969">It is the only pew in the chapel so distinguished; and I know of no other instance of his conformity to the delicate accommodations of modern times.</s> <s id="s2970">The fuel of the house, like that of their neighbours, consisted of peat, procured from the mosses by their own labour.</s> <s id="s2971">The lights by which, in the winter evenings their work was performed, were of their own manufacture, such as still continue to be used in these cottages; they are made of the pith of rushes dipped in any unctuous substance that the house affords.</s> <s id="s2972">White candles, as tallow candles are here called, were reserved to honour the Christmas festivals, and were perhaps produced on no other occasions.</s> <s id="s2973">Once a month, during the proper season, a sheep was drawn from their small mountain flock, and killed for the use of the family; and a cow, towards the close of the year, was salted and dried for winter provision; the hide was tanned to furnish them with shoes.</s> <s id="s2974">By these various resources, this venerable clergyman reared a numerous family, not only preserving them, as he affectingly says,' from wanting the necessaries of life;' but affording them an unstinted education, and the means of raising themselves in society.</s> <s id="s2975">In this they were eminently assisted by the effects of their father's example, his precepts and injunctions; he was aware that truth-speaking, a a moral virtue, is best secured by inculcating attention to accuracy of report even on trivial occasions; and so rigid were the rules of honesty by which he endeavoured to bring up his family, that if one of them had chanced to find in the lanes or fields anything of the least use or value, without being able to ascertain to whom it belonged, he always insisted upon the child's carrying it back to the place from which it had been brought."</s></p>
<p><s id="s2976">Speaking of the seemingly unfavourable circumstances in which Mr. Walker lived for the cultivation of the mind and the display of its graces, Wordsworth says: -" But, in this extraordinary man, things in their nature adverse were reconciled.</s> <s id="s2977">His conversation was remarkable, not only for being chaste and pure, but for the degree in which it was fervent and eloquent; his written style was correct, simple, and animated, nor did his affections suffer more than his intellect; he was tenderly alive to all the duties of his pastoral office; the poor and needy' he never sent empty away,' - the stranger was fed and refreshed in passing that unfrequented vale - the sick were visited; and the feelings of humanity found exercise among the distresses and embarrassments in the worldly estate of his neighbours, with which his talents for business made him acquainted; and the disinterestedness, impartiality, and uprightness which he maintained in the management of all affairs confided to him, were virtues seldom separated in his own conscience from religious obligation.</s></p>
<p><s id="s2978">" The afternoon service in the chapel was less numerously attended than that in the morning, but by a more serious auditory; the lesson from the New Testament, on those occasions, was accompanied by Burkitt's Commentaries.</s> <s id="s2979">These lessons he read with impassioned emphasis, frequently drawing tears from his hearers, and leaving a lasting impression on their minds.</s> <s id="s2980">His devotional feelings and the powers of his own mind were further exercised, along with those of his family, in perusing the Scriptures: not only on the Sunday evening, but on every other evening, while the rest of the household were at work, some of the children, and in her turn the servant, for the sake of practice in reading, or for instruction, read the Bible aloud; and in this manner the whole was repeatedly gone through.</s> <s id="s2981">That no common importance was attached to the observance of religious ordinances by his family, appears from the following memorandum by one of his descendents, which I am tempted to insert at length, as it is characteristic and somewhat curious.</s> <s id="s2982">' There is as small chapel in the county palatine of <enamex sw="w393875" long="-2.801902525771824" lat="54.04660667916625" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:11190914" name="Lancaster" conf="3.134718443">Lancaster</enamex>, where a certain clergyman has regularly officiated above sixty years, and a few months ago administered the sacrament of the Lord's supper in that same, to a decent number of devout communicants.</s> <s id="s2983">After the clergyman had received himself, the first company out of the assembly who approached the altar and kneeled down to the partakers of the sacred elements, consisted of the parson's wife - to whom he had been married upwards of sixty years - one son and his wife; four daughters, each with her husband; whose ages, all added together, amount to above 714 years.</s> <s id="s2984">The several and respective distances from the place of each of their abodes, to the chapel where they all communicated, will measure more than 1000 English miles.'</s></p>
<p><s id="s2985">It would be unpardonable to omit that, in the maintenance of his virtues, he received due support from the partner of his long life.</s> <s id="s2986">She was equally strict in attendance of her share of their joint cares, nor less diligent in her appropriate occupations.</s> <s id="s2987">A person who had been some time their servant in the latter part of their lives, concluded the panegyric of her mistress, by saying to me,' She was no less excellent than her husband; she was good to the poor; she was good to everything!'
