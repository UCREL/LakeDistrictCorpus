</p>
<p><s id="s2">Whilst you was engaged in contemplating those wonderful productions of ancient art, which <enamex  sw="w125" name="Large admin unit">Italy</enamex> is enriched with, I was tracing the ruder beauties of Nature in a domestic tour through the mountainous parts of <enamex  sw="w244" name="Large admin unit">Westmoreland</enamex> and <enamex  sw="w261" name="Large admin unit">Cumberland</enamex>: You carried out with you a disinterested passion for your art, with faculties which this country hath rarely given birth to; and you return from your travels with some specimens of so auspicious a sort, that, when encouragement shall provoke your genius to its full display, we are persuaded you will take rank with the first masters of the highest province and best age of painting: I set out on my expedition with no other pretensions than a devout respect for Nature in her sublimest shapes, and some small leanings towards the Muse; not enough to make our intercourse the talk of posterity, but barely sufficient to fill up the hour.</s> <s id="s3">The fruit of my tour hath been, what I fear is scarce worth laying at your feet, the following Irregular Ode, which was literally struck out on the spot, and is addrest to the Sun; for as the season was far advanced towards winter, we had frequent temptations to invoke that luminary, who was never very gracious to our suit, except whilst we were viewing the lack of <enamex sw="w1279" long="-3.137880601359804" lat="54.60120234465001" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:11185565" name="Keswick" conf="2.6">Keswick</enamex> and its accompaniments.</s></p>
<p><s id="s4">If I should be asked why I give that to the world and you, which I really think scarce worthy of the acceptance of you and the world, Ihave only to answer, that if the honest pride of the Friend did not draw it into public, the idle vanity of the Poet would be well content to spare the Press its pains: but the gratification of saying how much I respect your genius and esteem your virtues, finds it an easy task to overcome the remonstrances of Judgement, or the terrors of criticism.</s></p>
<p><s id="s5">Mr. Gray, whose faculty of describing can give life to scenes which I should have conceived nothing but pencil could convey, hath left behind him a Journal, for which we are indebted to his candid friend and editor.</s> <s id="s6">This Journal refers to all the scenes hinted at in the following Ode; and being a book in every body's hands, makes it unnecessary for me to trouble the Reader with any attempts of my own by way of notes, which with the best of poems seldom accord, and in my instance might have been a hazardous experiment.</s></p>
<p><s id="s7">How it came to pass, that this enchanting display of sublime and beautiful objects could extort nothing more than a prosaic description from a poetical pen, I am at a loss to guess.</s> <s id="s8">I have been favoured with a Manuscript of the late ingenious Dr. Brown, which I have the privilege of inserting in this publication, and should so have done, but that I found it had already got forth into the world, and was in print: It is touched with great spirit, and in a glowing stile, which gradually kindles till it breaks forth into the following rhapsody, which I believe hath hitherto escaped publication:</s></p>
<p> <s id="s9">Now sunk the Sun, now Twilight sunk, and Night Rode in her zenith; nor a passing breeze Sighed to the groves, which in the midnight air Stood motionless, and in the peaceful floods Inverted hung: For now the billow slept Along the shore, nor heaved the deep, but spread A shining mirror to Moon's pale orb, Which, dim and waining, o' ver the shadowy clifts, The solemn woods and spiry mountain-tops Her glimmering faintness threw: Now every eye, Oppressed with toil, was drowned in deep repose; Save that the unseen sheperd in his watch, Propt on his crook, stood listening by the fold, And gazed the starry vault and pendant moon; Nor voice nor sound broke on the deep seren, But the soft murmur of swift-gushing rills, Forth Issuing from the mountain's distant sleep,( Unheard till now, and now scarce heard) proclaimed All things at rest, and imaged the still voice Of quiet whispering to the ear of Night.</s></p>
<p> <s id="s10">In fine, says Dr. Browne, this accumulation of beauty and immensity tends not only to excite the rapture but reverence; for my part I make an annual voyage to <enamex sw="w4009" long="-3.137880601359804" lat="54.60120234465001" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:11185565" name="Keswick" conf="2.6">Keswick</enamex>, not only as an innocent amusement, but a religious act.</s> <s id="s11">I walk forth in this stupendous scene, as into the grandest earthly temple of the Creator; and as I take my progess through its several parts, often break forth with the divine Psalmist in that grateful exclamation--" O Lord, how manifold are thy works;" in wisdom hast thou made them all."</s></p>
<p><s id="s12">What I have here inserted is taken from a letter to a friend, and is a valuable specimen of the author.</s> <s id="s13">As for the minute delineations, which some travellers affect to give of scenes that come under their contemplation, they seldom convey to my apprehension any map of the place they describe.</s> <s id="s14">To you perhaps, whose pictures are language, language may be a picture; and as I know you can paint our very words, words may in return paint that to you, of which a less intuitive mind takes no conception; the bulk of mankind however collect little from these descriptions but the amusement of reading them; and the most they can effect is to refresh the memories of them, who have been on the spot, or to inspire those, who have not been, with a resolution of going thither.</s> <s id="s15">And in truth a more pleasing tour than these lakes hold out to men of leisure and curiosity cannot be devised.</s> <s id="s16">We penetrate the Glacieres, traverse the <enamex sw="w5289" long="5.41750431060791" lat="45.31649780273438" type="rgn" gazref="unlock:14129901" name="Rhône-Alpes" conf="0.5905922848">Rhone</enamex> and the <enamex sw="w5303" long="-2.533735742717147" lat="51.63466210822006" type="water" gazref="unlock:8787205" name="Great Leaze Rhine" conf="0.868424261">Rhine</enamex>, whilst our own domestic lakes of Ulswater, <enamex sw="w5353" long="-3.137880601359804" lat="54.60120234465001" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:11185565" name="Keswick" conf="2.6">Keswick</enamex> and <enamex sw="w5365" long="-2.907933804199639" lat="54.37599546506077" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:10204" name="Windermere" conf="2.414645753">Windermere</enamex> exhibit scenes in so sublime a stile, with such beautiful colourings of rock, wood and water, backed with so tremendous a disposition of mountains, that if they do not fairly take the lead of all the views in <enamex  sw="w5585" name="Large admin unit">Europe</enamex>, yet they are indisputably such as no Enlish traveller should leave behind him, provided he be one, who, with my Atticus, loves</s></p>

<p><s id="s18">But the views of our young travelling gentry, as you must well know, are not thus directed: on the road they are couriers; in the cities they are revellers: Whilst they are journeying there is no respite nor repose; their enquiries extend neither to right hand nor left, and seldom further forward than to the next poste; the shortest and straightest road to dissipation and pleasure is their's, all the rest is out of the way: but if their course should necessarily carry them up to any thing curious in nature, if their road should compel them to the banks of a torrent, or the brow of a mountain, they are asleep, or it is dark night and they cannot see it, for they are in haste, and want to be at the next great noisy town: And now begins the plan of all their operations; here they lay in their stock of new cloathes, new taste and new opinions; in return for which they barter away all their little fund of money, modesty and religion: Here they walk through palaces of pictures with as much edification as a boarding-school girl would through the Museum, or an upholsterer through the <enamex sw="w7282" long="12.31393337249756" lat="41.87854766845703" type="ppla" gazref="unlock:14127206" name="Vatican City" conf="1.015318961">Vatican</enamex>.</s> <s id="s19">They have been told of the gusto of the antique, but where to find it, or how to distinguish it, they know no more than their mothers: Virtù however is to be purchased, like other superfluities, and in the end their Cicerone lays them in for a bargain, perhaps a patch-work head of <enamex  sw="w7574" name="Not a placename">Trajan</enamex> set upon a modern pair of shoulders, and made up with <enamex sw="w7635" long="-76.29299" lat="-10.15499" type="other" gazref="unlock:6609645" name="Caracalla" conf="0">Caracalla</enamex>' s nose and Nero' s ears,</s></p>
