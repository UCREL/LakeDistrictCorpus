</p>
<p><s id="s10">Preface.</s> </p>
<p><s id="s11">Any one acquainted with the most popular dramas of the present day will not accuse an author of much vanity, in thinking it no very difficult task to please the public in writing for the stage.</s></p>
<p><s id="s12">Impressed with this idea, when the Author of the following drama had an offer made him by a friend of the Deputy Manager of Covent Garden Theatre to present any piece, and insure its being, at least, read by him( for pieces are sometimes refused without being read), he immediately set about it; thinking he should be well repaid, if, for a few weeks trouble, he could put a few hundred pounds into his pocket; and that the loss would not be very great if unsuccessful.</s></p>
<p><s id="s13">To produce a laughable piece, and give the musical composer and scene painter an opportunity of displaying their talents, was the object therefore in writing the following scenes, rather than an attempt at writing a regular drama.</s> <s id="s14">Yet the Author, in striving to please, did not so far forget his duty as a moralist, as to sacrifice morality to mirth, and good sense to scenery; and while he attempted to amuse, he wished to expose and lend his feeble aid to correct some of the follies of the age.</s> <s id="s15">He would have thought it a reflection upon the public to have exceeded the bounds of probability for effect, at least of such probability as the prescription of the stage allows: he would not have introduced an Otaheitean at the Lord Treasurer Burleigh's, nor have gone so far as to" make his heroine blue."</s></p>
<p><s id="s16">He had flattered himself into the persuasion, that the character of Veronica was new to the stage; and, in able hands, would produce a very laughable effect: it was written purposely for Mrs. <enamex sw="w2325" long="-3.995755977943012" lat="51.17318039289925" type="mtn" gazref="unlock:11214687" name="Mattocks Down" conf="0.9519957669">Mattocks</enamex>; and, if the Author is any judge of the abilities of others, Mrs. <enamex sw="w2400" long="-3.995755977943012" lat="51.17318039289925" type="mtn" gazref="unlock:11214687" name="Mattocks Down" conf="0.9519957669">Mattocks</enamex> is the only person who could have performed it.</s> <s id="s17">In her line she is unrivalled; and in her hands Veronica would have received a thousand touches, which the pen of an author could never supply; and upon her powers the author would willingly have risked his success.</s></p>
<p><s id="s18">Now, whether the piece had no merit at all, or whether it had less merit than the dramas which have lately been produced at Covent Garden Theatre, or whether the Author was too obscure, and could not fill the boxes on its appearance, certain it is, that the piece, after a short time, was returned with a no; adding, that where a piece was not accepted, no remarks or suggestions were ever made.</s></p>
<p><s id="s19">The Author was now thrown upon the world.</s> <s id="s20">As money was his object, he did not apply to the other winter theatre, but presented it to the Manager of the Haymarket Theatre; thinking it possible, if he approved it, that he might engage Mrs. <enamex sw="w3307" long="-3.995755977943012" lat="51.17318039289925" type="mtn" gazref="unlock:11214687" name="Mattocks Down" conf="0.9519957669">Mattocks</enamex> to perform the principle character, as he had formerly engaged Mr. Kemble for a similar purpose in one of his own pieces.</s> <s id="s21">But Mr. Colman thought" its representation would not serve the interests of the Haymarket Theatre."</s></p>
<p><s id="s22">The Author had now only to reflect upon what had been before suggested to him, that the piece was better adapted to the closet than the stage, as the character of Veronica could only have its full force with those who understood botany.</s> <s id="s23">This was very true, but it was a circumstance that he was aware of even from the beginning.</s> <s id="s24">He flattered himself, that as the study of Botany was very fashionable, and as almost every body knew something of its outlines, the majority of an audience would understand it, and the remainer would be pleased with the comic sound of the jargon, when delivered with humour, though unacquainted with its literal meaning.</s> <s id="s25">He had heard audiences set into roars of laugher by Lingo's bad Latin, though perhaps four - fifths of the audience were unacquainted with the language.</s> <s id="s26">Moreover, French, Italian, German, and Scotch characters are generally received with applause, though their language is often perfectly unintelligible.</s></p>
<p><s id="s27">Unwilling, like a fond parent, that his child should remain in obscurity, the Author consigns it to the closet, at the same time intreating the Reader to keep in mind, that it was written principally for acting, and for the singular manner of Mrs. <enamex sw="w4740" long="-3.995755977943012" lat="51.17318039289925" type="mtn" gazref="unlock:11214687" name="Mattocks Down" conf="0.9519957669">Mattocks</enamex>, to be set off with the farther advantages of music, and the most beautiful scenery that can be imagined.</s> <s id="s28">Had it appeared on the stage, many parts would have been considerably curtailed, as too long for effect in representation, but which the Author hopes will, nevertheless, prove entertaining in the closet, if not absolutely essential to his design: he wished, as much as possible, to realize to his Reader the spot where he has laid his scene, that those who have seen it may recall the original to their minds, and to give the best idea of it in his power to those who have not.</s></p>
<p><s id="s29">It only remains to say a few words upon the objects of the ridicule.</s> <s id="s30">The Author assures himself he is not singular in thinking the study of Botany not altogether a proper amusement for the more polished sex; and the false taste of a licentious age, which is gaining ground, and corrupting the soft and elegant manners of the otherwise loveliest part of the creation, requires every discouragement which can be given.</s></p>

<p><s id="s44">Thither, attracted from their peaceful home, The Poet and the Painter love to roam, Feed fancy full,' till fraught with fire divine, Their beauties on the page and canvas shine; There <enamex  sw="w7246" name="Large admin unit">Cumberland</enamex> enriched his moral muse, And Farrington produced his matchless Views.</s> </p><p> <s id="s45">Of all the views of the Lakes Mr. Farrington's are perhaps the best, and the most faithful representations; yet he has certainly taken some liberties.</s> <s id="s46">Had this Prologue been written after the opening of an Exhibition for the present year, Mr. W. Turner's name would have been mentioned as an artist, whose Views of the Lakes do honour to himself and the scenes they represent.</s></p>
<p><s id="s47">There, too, the botanist, with prying eyes; Culls the fair flowers in all their thousand dyes; The teeming waters yield the scaly race, And the keen sportsman joins the noisy chase; Health, rosy goddess, there unharmed resides, And Liberty, the mountain nymph, presides.</s> <s id="s48">Each season there delighted myriads throng To pass their time these charming scenes among: For pleasure, knowledge, many thither hie, For fashion some, and some-- they know not why.</s> <s id="s49">And these same visitors, even one and all, The Natives by the name of Lakers call.</s></p>
<p><s id="s50">There has our Author fixed his Drama's Scene, Such are his Characters, if right I ween: A motley groupe, of various tastes, no doubt, And each pursuing what his taste points out; But how together brought, and what befell These Lakers there, the Piece itself must tell.</s></p>
<p><s id="s51">Thus much the Prologue for the Drama says,-- And now the Author for your patience prays; Hopes that you'll all your best of humours wear, And to exert your candour will prepare; For I am bid to say in his behalf, He humbly hopes that he shall make you laugh, And, as he shows, so likewise let him reap, And, if he makes you laugh, give not him cause to weep.</s></p><p><s id="s52">Dramatis Personae.</s> <s id="s53">Sir Charles <enamex sw="w8901" long="-3.160383346954682" lat="54.60035046101643" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:13221" name="Portinscale" conf="2.6">Portinscale</enamex>.</s> <s id="s54">Bob Kiddy.</s> <s id="s55">First Pedestrian Second Pedestrian Billy Simple, a <enamex sw="w8976" long="119.9434" lat="10.5165" type="other" gazref="unlock:13992373" name="Bagman Bay" conf="0">Bagman</enamex>.
