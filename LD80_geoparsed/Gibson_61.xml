and I may quote Anderson, the Cumbrian bard, in support of the correctness of this statement, premising that the customs of this portion of <enamex  sw="w119517" name="Large admin unit">Lancashire</enamex> are, in all respects, similar to those in <enamex  sw="w119570" name="Large admin unit">Cumberland</enamex> and <enamex  sw="w119585" name="Large admin unit">Westmorland</enamex>.</s> <s id="s461">He says,--" A Cumbrian peasant pays his addresses to his sweetheart during the silence and solemnity of midnight, when every bosom is at rest, except those of love and sorrow.</s> <s id="s462">Anticipating her kindness, he will travel ten or twelve miles over hills, bogs, moors and mosses, undiscouraged by the length of the road, the darkness of the night, or the intemperature of the weather.</s> <s id="s463">On reaching her habitation, he gives a gentle tap at the window of her chamber, at which signal she immediately rises, dresses herself, and proceeds, with all possible silence, to the door, which she gently opens, lest a creeking hinge or a barking dog should awaken the family.</s> <s id="s464">** Next the courtship commences, previously to which the fire is darkened or extinguished, lest its light should guide to the window some idle or licentious eye.</s> <s id="s465">In this dark and uncomfortable situation( at least uncomfortable to all but lovers), they remain till the advance of day," and so on, concluding with some moralizing remarks upon this naughty custom, which I do not feel myself called upon to repeat.</s> <s id="s466">These" sittings," which are in constant practice all over these northern counties, and which, after all, are not so bad as the Scotch and Welsh sweethearting customs, generally come off on the Saturday nights; and this practice, which involves the violation of the Sabbath, as well as the breach of decorum, is unnoticed, or rather winked at, by most writers who pretend to describe" life and manners" in the Lake country, such as Wilson, Wordsworth, De Quincey, and, lastly, Mr Parkinson.</s> <s id="s467">In fact, there appears a design amongst that tribe of writers to cry up the inhabitants of secluded districts such as these, at the expense of the inhabitants of towns.</s> <s id="s468">I am ready to do battle in this cause under the banner of Miss <enamex  sw="w121392" name="Not a placename">Martineau</enamex>, who, in her triumphant answer to the arguments of those who opposed the introduction of railways into the Lake district, on the plea, amongst others equally absurd, that the morality of the people would suffer from contact with the denizens of towns, who, it was dreaded, would avail themselves in crowds of the increased facilities of transit, says--" As for the fear that the innocent rural population will be morally corrupted by intercourse with people from the towns, we have no apprehension of this, but are disposed to hope rather than fear certain consequences from the increased intercourse of the mountaineers with the people of large towns.</s> <s id="s469">We doubt at once the innocence of the one party, and the specific corruption of the other.</s> <s id="s470">Scarcely anything can be conceived more lifeless, unvaried, and unideal, than the existence of the dalesmen and their families;

<p><s id="s644">It is worthy of being remarked, that, in the early ages, the mode of obtaining the ore, which is generally found in veins, or lodes, intermingled with quartz, and surrounded by very hard rock, was similar to that which the Roman historians say was adopted by <enamex  sw="w164508" name="Not a placename">Hannibal</enamex> to smooth his passage over the Alps; that is, they kindled large fires upon the veins, and having heated the stone as much as possible, poured water upon it,( the Carthaginians used vinegar,) which, by the sudden and copious abstraction of caloric, caused it to crack, or burst, and so rendered a circumscribed portion workable by their rude implements, some of which-- small quadrangular iron wedges, with a hole at the thick end used for the insertion of a handle-- have been recently found in the very old workings.</s> <s id="s645">The invention of gunpowder and its application to blasting purposes, have, of course, for ages, superseded this primitive modus operandi;</s></p>
