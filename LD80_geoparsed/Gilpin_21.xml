<p><s id="s67">These tints, which are the most beautiful ornaments of the mountain, are of all colours; but the most prevalent are yellow, and purple.</s> <s id="s68">We can hardly consider blue as a mountain-tint.</s> <s id="s69">It is the mere colour of the intervening air-- the hue, which naturally invests all distant objects, as well as mountains.</s> <s id="s70">The late Dr. Brown, author of the Estimate, in a description, which he printed, of the lake of <enamex sw="w10594" long="-3.137880601359804" lat="54.60120234465001" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:11185565" name="Keswick" conf="2.6">Keswick</enamex>, very justly calls these tints the yellow streams of light, the purple hues, and misty azure of the mountains.

<p><s id="s72">The variety of these tints depends on many circumstances-- the season of the year-- the hour of the day-- a dry, or moist atmosphere.</s> <s id="s73">The lines and shapes of mountains( features strongly marked) are easily caught and retained: but these meteor-forms, this rich fluctuation of airy hues, offer such a profusion of variegated splendor, that they are continually illuding the eye with breaking into each other; and are lost, as it endeavours to retain them.</s> <s id="s74">This airy colouring, tho in sunshine it appears most brilliant; yet in some degree it is generally found in those mountains, where it prevails.</s></p>
<p><s id="s75">In the late voyages round the world, published by Dr. Hawksworth, we have an account of the great beauty of the colouring observed on the peak of <enamex sw="w11694" long="-72.04896460000001" lat="42.208704" type="other" gazref="unlock:7693695" name="Teneriffe Hill" conf="0.7259089959">Teneriffe</enamex>.</s> <s id="s76">" It's appearance at" sun-set, says the author, was very sriking.</s> <s id="s77">When the sun was below the horizon, and the rest of the island appeared of a deep black; the mountain still reflected his rays, and glowed with a warmth of colouring, which no painting can express."</s></p>
<p><s id="s78">The rays of the sun, which are the cause of all colour, no doubt, produce these tints to the eye; yet we must believe there is something peculiar in the surfaces of some mountains, which dispose them to reflect the rays with such variety of tints.</s> <s id="s79">On many mountains these appearances are not observable; and where the surface is uniform, the tint will be so likewise.</s> <s id="s80">" The effect in question, says Mr. Lock, remarking on this passage, is very familiar to me.</s> <s id="s81">I saw it almost every evening in Savoy, when the sun shone.</s> <s id="s82">It is only on the tops of the highest mountains, that the effect is perfect.</s> <s id="s83"><enamex sw="w12565" long="6.864" lat="45.833" type="manual_update"  gazref="Geoname_ID_3181986" name="Mont Blanc" conf="99991">Mount Blanc</enamex> being covered with the purest snow, and having no tint of it's own, was often of the brightest rose-colour."</s></p>

<p><s id="s96">Many, shadowing mountains intervene.</s></p>
<p><s id="s97">The cavities which he observed, and which are seen only from their being the deep recesses of shade, together with the rocks, and little projections, which are visible only from catching a stronger ray of light, contribute to produce the partial effect-- that richness, and variety on the sides of distant mountains, which would otherwise be a display of flat, fatiguing surface.</s> <s id="s98">The objects themselves are formless, and indistinct; yet, by presenting different surfaces for the light to reflect on, the rich and variegated effect, here mentioned, is produced.</s></p>
<p><s id="s99">The grand masses are formed by one mountain's over-shadowing another-- by the sun's turning round some promontory-- or by the transverse position of mountains; in all which cases the shadow falls broad and deep-- sweeps over all the smaller shades, to which it still, gives a deeper tinge; and unites the whole in one great effect.</s></p>
<p><s id="s100">It is an agreeable amusement to attend these vast shadows in their slow, and solemn march over the mountains-- to observe, how the morning sun sheds only a faint catching light upon the summits of the hills, through one general mass of hazy shade-- in a few hours how all this confusion is dissipated-- how the lights and shades begin to break, and separate, and take their form and breadth-- how deep and determined the shadows are at noon-- how fugitive and uncertain, as the sun declines; till it's fires, glowing in the west, light up a new radiance through the landscape; and spread over it, instead of sober light and shade, all the colours of nature, in one bright, momentary gleam.</s></p>
<p><s id="s101">It is equally amusing to observe the various shapes, which mountains assume through all this variety of illumination; rocks, knolls, and promontories, taking new forms; appearing, and disappearing, as the sun veers round; whose radiance, like varnish on a picture,( if I may use a degrading comparison,) brings out a thousand objects unobserved before.</s></p>
<p><s id="s102">To these more permanent effects of illumination may be added another species, which arises from accident-- I mean those partial, flitting shades, which are occasioned by floating clouds.</s> <s id="s103">These may sometimes produce a good effect; but they contribute as often to disturb the repose of a landscape.</s> <s id="s104">To painters however they are of great use, who are frequently obliged, by an untoward subject, to take the advantage of every probability to produce an effect.</s></p>

</p>
<p><s id="s107">Having thus considered the chief circumstances, which occur in distant mountains, let us now inlarge our view, and take in the lake, which makes the next considerable part of this romantic country.</s></p>
<p><s id="s108">The fen, the pool, and the lake would present very different ideas, tho magnitude were out of the question.</s></p>
<p><s id="s109">The fe is a plashy inundation, formed on a flat-- without depth-- without lineal boundary-- of ambiguous texture-- half water-- and half land-- a sort of vegetable fluid.</s></p>
<p><s id="s110">The pool is a collection of the soakings of some common; or the reservoir of the neighbouring ditches, which deposit in it's ouzy bed the soid of the country, clay, or mud; and give a correspondent tinge to the water.</s></p>
<p><s id="s111">In some things the fen and the pool agree.</s> <s id="s112">They both take every thing in, and let nothing out.</s> <s id="s113">Each of them is in summer a sink of putrefaction; and the receptacle of all those unclean, misshapen forms in animal life, which breed and batten in the impurities of stagnation;</s></p>
<p><s id="s114">Where putrefaction into life ferments, And breathes destructive myriads.</s></p>
<p><s id="s115">Very different is the origin of the lake. It's magnificent, and marble bed, formed in the caverns and deep recesses of rocky mountains, received originally the pure pellucide waters of some rushing torrent, as it came first from the hand of nature-- arrested it's course, till the spacious, and splendid bason was filled brimfull; and then discharged the stream, unsullied, and undiminished, through some winding vale, to form other lakes, or increase the dignity of some imperial river.</s> <s id="s116">Here no impurities find entrance, either of animal, or of vegetable life:</s></p>
<p><s id="s117">-- Non illic canna palustris, <enamex sw="w18213" long="-1.5818" lat="52.4289" type="other" gazref="unlock:5829719" name="Quality Hotel Coventry/NEC" conf="0.8501508542">Nec</enamex> steriles ulvae, nec acuta cuspide junci.</s></p>
<p><s id="s118">From the brisk circulation of fluid through these animated bodies of water, a great master of nature has nobly styled them, living lakes:</s></p>
<p><s id="s119">-- Speluncae Vivique lacus.--</s></p>
<p><s id="s120">and indeed nothing, which is not really alive, deserves the appellation better.</s> <s id="s121">For besides the vital stream, which principally feeds them, they receive a thousand little gurgling rills, which trickling through a thousand veins, give life, and spirit to every part.</s></p>
<p><s id="s122">The principal incidents observable in lakes, are, their line of boundary-- their islands-- and the different appearances of the surface of the water.</s></p>
<p><s id="s123">The line of boundary is very various.</s> <s id="s124">Sometimes it is boldly broken by a projecting promontory-- sometimes indented by a creek-- sometimes it undulates by an irregular shore-- and sometimes swells into a winding bay.</s> <s id="s125">In each of these circumstances it is susceptible of beauty; in all, it certainly deserves attention: for as it is of course so conspicuous a boundary, that the least harshness in it is discernible.</s> <s id="s126">I have known many a good landscape injured by a bad water boundary.</s></p>
<p><s id="s127">This line, it may be further observed, varies under different circumstances.</s> <s id="s128">When the eye is placed upon the lake, the line of boundary is a circular thread, with little undulation; unless when some promontory of more than usual magnitude shoots into the water.</s> <s id="s129">All smaller irregularities are lost.</s> <s id="s130">The particular beauty of it under this circumstance, consists in the opposition between such a thread, and the irregular line formed by the summits of the mountains.</s></p>
<p><s id="s131">But when the eye is placed on the higher grounds, above the level of the lake, the line of boundary takes a new form; and what appeared to the levelled eye a circular thread, becomes now an undulating line, projecting, and retiring more or less, according to the degree of the eye's elevation.</s> <s id="s132">The circular thread was indebted for it's principal beauty to contrast: but this, like all other elegant lines, has the additional beauty of variety.</s></p>
<p><s id="s133">And yet, in some cases, the levelled eye has the advantage of the elevated one.</s> <s id="s134">The line, which forms an acute angle from the higher situation, may be softened, when seen from the water, into an easy curve.</s></p>
<p><s id="s135">The islands fall next under our view.</s> <s id="s136">These are either beauty, or a deformity to the lake; as they are shaped, or stationed.</s></p>
<p><s id="s137">If the island be round, or of any other regular form; or if the wood upon it be thick and heavy( as I have observed some planted with a close grove of Scotch fir) it can never be an object of beauty.</s> <s id="s138">At hand, it is a heavy lump: at a distance, a murky spot.</s></p>
<p><s id="s139">Again, if the island,( however beautifully shaped, or planted;) be seated in the centre of a round lake; in the focus of an oval one; or in any other regular position; the beauty of it is lost, at least in some points of view.</s></p>
<p><s id="s140">But when it's lines, and shape are both irregular-- when it is ornamented with ancient oak, rich in foliage, but light and airy-- and when it takes some irregular situation in the lake; then it is an object truly beautiful-- beautiful in itself, as well as in composition.</s> <s id="s141">It must however be added, that it would be difficult to place such an object in any situation, that would be equally pleasing to every stand.</s></p>
<p><s id="s142">The surface of the lake offers itself last to observation.</s> <s id="s143">The several incidents, which arise here, are all owing to the sky, and the disposition of the water to receive it's impression.</s></p>
<p><s id="s144">That the sky is the great regulator of the colour of the water, is known to all artists.</s></p>
<p><s id="s145"><enamex sw="w21755" name="Olli">Olli</enamex> caeruleus supra caput astitit imber, Noctem hyememque ferens: et inhorruit unda tenebris.</s></p>

<p> <s id="s147">Jamque rubescebat radiis mare, et athere ab alto Aurora in roseis fulgebat lutea bigis.</s></p>
<p><s id="s148">The effect indeed holds universallyy; as water in all cases, exposed to the sky, will act as a mirror to it.</s></p>
<p><s id="s149">In the darkness of a brooding storm, we have just seen, the whole body of the water will be dark: inhorruit unda tenebris.</s></p>
<p><s id="s150">In clear, and windy weather, the breezy ruffled lake, as <enamex  sw="w22242" name="Not a placename">Thomson</enamex> calls it, is a shattered mirror: It reflects the serenity; but reflects it partially.</s> <s id="s151">The hollow of each wave is commonly in shadow, the summit is tipped with light.</s> <s id="s152">The light or shadow therefore prevails, according to the position of the waves to the eye: and at a distance, when the summits of the waves, agreeably to the rules of perspective, appear in contact, the whole surface in that part will be light.</s></p>
<p><s id="s153">But when the sky is splendid, and at the same times calm, the water( being then a perfect mirror,) will glow all over with correspondent tints; unless other reflections, from the objects around, intervene, and form more vivid pictures.</s></p>
<p><s id="s154">Often you will see a spacious bay, screened by some projecting promontory, in perfect repose; while the rest of the lake, more pervious to the air, is crisped over by a gentle ripple.</s></p>
<p><s id="s155">Sometimes also, when the whole lake is tranquil, a gentle perturbation will arise in some distant part, from no apparent cause, from a breath of air, which nothing else can feel, and creeping softly on, communicate the tremulous shudder with exquisite sensibility over half the surface.</s> <s id="s156">In this observation I do little more than translate from <enamex  sw="w23426" name="Not a placename">Ovid</enamex>:</s></p>
<p><s id="s157">-- Exhorruit, aequoris instar, Quod fremit, exigua cum summum stringitur aura.</s></p>
<p><s id="s158">No pool, no river-bay, can present this idea in it's utmost purity.</s> <s id="s159">In them every crystalline particle is set, as it were, in a socket of mud.</s> <s id="s160">Their lubricity is lost.</s> <s id="s161">More or less, they all flow cum gurgite flavo. But the lake, like Spencer's fountain, which sprang from the limpid tears of a nymph,</s></p>
<p><s id="s162">-- is chast, and pure, as purest snow, Ne lets her waves with any filth be dyed.</s></p>
<p><s id="s163">Refined thus from every obstruction, it is tremblingly alive all over: the merest trifle, a frisking fly, a falling leaf, almost a sound alarms it,</s></p>
<p><s id="s164">-- that sound, Which from the mountain, previous to the storm, Rolls over the muttering earth, disturbs the flood, And shakes the forest-leaf without a breath.</s></p>
<p><s id="s165">This tremulous shudder is sometimes even still more partial: It will run in lengthened parallels, and separate the reflections upon the surface, which are lost on one side, and taken up on the other.</s> <s id="s166">This is perhaps the most picturesque form, which water assumes; as it affords the painter an opportunity of throwing in those lengthened lights and shades, which give the greatest variety and clearness to water.</s></p>
<p><s id="s167">There is another appearance on the surfaces of lakes, which we cannot account for on any principle either of optics, or of perspective.</s> <s id="s168">When there is no apparent cause in the sky, the water will sometimes appear dappled with large spots of shade.</s> <s id="s169">It is possible these patches may have connection with the bottom of the lake; as naturalists suppose, the shining parts of the sea are occasioned by the spawn of fish: but it is more probable, that in some way, they are connected with the sky, as they generally esteemed in the country to be a weather-gage.</s> <s id="s170">The people will often say," It will be no" hay-day to day, the lake is full of shades."-- I never myself saw this appearance; o I might be able to give a better account of it: but I have heard it so often taken notice of; that I suppose there is at least some ground for the observation.</s> <s id="s171">Tho, after all, I think it probably these shades may be owing only to floating clouds.</s></p>
<p><s id="s172">From this great variety, which the surfaces of lakes assume, we may draw this conclusion, that the painter may take great liberties, in point of light and shade, in his representation of water.</s> <s id="s173">It is, in many cases, under no rule, that we are acquainted with; or under rules so lax, that the imagination is left very much at large.</s></p>
<p><s id="s174">On the subject of lakes, I have only farther to add, that many bodies of water, under this denomination, are found upon the summits of lofty mountains.</s> <s id="s175">In this situation they are commonly made basons; or reservoirs; and want the pleasing accompaniments, which adorn the lower lakes.</s> <s id="s176">Lakes of this kind are a collection of springs; and discharge themselves generally from their elevated stations in cascades.</s></p>
<p><s id="s177">Sect.</s> <s id="s178">Viii.</s>
</p>
<p><s id="s179">We have now made a considerable advance towards a landscape.</s> <s id="s180">The sky is laid in; a mountain fills the offskip; and a lake, with it's accompaniments, takes possession of a nearer distance.</s> <s id="s181">Nothing but a fore-ground is wanting; and for this we have great choice of objects-- broken ground-- trees-- rocks-- cascades-- and vallies.</s></p>
<p><s id="s182">In a distance the ruling character is tenderness; which on a fore-ground, gives way to what the painter calls force, and richness. Force arises from a violent opposition of colour, light, and shade: richness consists in a variety of parts, and glowing tints.</s> <s id="s183">In some degree, richness is found in a distance; but never, united with force: for in a distance; tho the lights may be strong, and the parts varied; yet the shades and tints will ever be faint, and tender.</s></p>
<p><s id="s184">In the mean time, this opposition on the fore-ground, violent as it is, must always be subject to the ruling masses of light and shade, and colouring, which harmonize the whole.</s></p>
<p><s id="s185">The effect of this harmony is breadth, or repose. It's opposite is flutter, and confusion.</s></p>
<p><s id="s186">It appears therefore, that the management of fore-grounds is a matter of great nicety.</s> <s id="s187">In them a very contradiction must be reconciled: breadth and repose, which consist in uniting the parts; must be made to agree with force and richness, which consist in violently breaking them. And what adds to the difficulty, the eye, brought thus on the spot, is hurt by the minutest defect.</s> <s id="s188">Whereas, at a distance, an irregular dash of the pencil, if it be not one thing, may be conceived to be another: obscurity is there a source of beauty.</s> <s id="s189">-- Hence it is, that many great masters, who can throw a distance into a pleasing confusion, and give it the effect of nature; have failed in exercising their art on a fore-ground.</s></p>
<p><s id="s190">Having premised thus much with regard to fore-grounds in general, let us now examine the fore-grounds, which are presented to us in this very picturesque country.</s></p>
<p> <s id="s191">Broken grounds are the first objects of our attention.</s> <s id="s192">Here they abound in every shape.</s> <s id="s193">The painter will easily find, either some rough knoll, whose parts are ample-- the sloping corner of a hill, perhaps worn by a mountain-torrent-- a rugged road, winding through the chasm of a rifted promontory-- or some other part of nature equally grand and picturesque.</s></p>
<p><s id="s194">If he chuse to adorn his fore-ground with wood( and who does not?) he will find it in some parts of this country in a tolerable style of greatness.</s> <s id="s195">But, in general, the old timber is decayed or cut down; and that sort of wood incouraged, which is the most profitable-- such wood, as, in a course of time, is turned into charcoal.</s> <s id="s196">It has, in some degree, the effect of better trees in a distance; but it is very deficient, when we call for an ancient oak to give the fore - ground a grandeur equal to the scene-- when we want the magnificence of it's shadowing form to mantle over the vacant corner of a landscape-- when we wish it to hid some heavy promontory; or to scatter a few loose branches over some ill-shaped mountain-line-- when it's massy foliage is necessary to give depth to shade-- it's twisted bole, covered with grey moss, to oppose the vivid green in it's neighbourhood-- or, lastly, it's warm autumnal tint to contrast the colder hues of distance.</s> <s id="s197">In all these cases a deficiency of forest-wood is sometimes regretted in the scenery before us; but not often: and where it is, the loss is easily supplied by other objects; among which rocks are the principal: and these, when ornamented with wood, tho of a smaller size, have generally the effect of the most luxuriant foliage.</s></p>
<p> <s id="s198">Rocks differ in surface; general form; and colour.</s></p>
<p><s id="s199">The rock naturally wears that smooth weather-beaten surface, which time gives it through a succession of ages.</s> <s id="s200">But rocks, firm as they are, are subject to change.</s> <s id="s201">Springs undermine them: torrents wash the earth from around them: frosts loosen them; and sometimes they are torn by storms and earthquakes.</s> <s id="s202">Under these circumstances, when large masses fall away, the rock exhibits a fractured surface; which in general has a better effect, than the smooth one.</s> <s id="s203">Nature, in these instances, may be said to retouch her compositions: the fractured parts are larger and sharper; and better adapted to receive either smart, catching light; or a body of light and shade.</s> <s id="s204">-- An humble imitation of the surfaces of fractured rocks is sometimes exhibited in large coals: they may at least assist the imagination of the painter.</s></p>
<p><s id="s205">With regard to the general form of rocks, both species, the smooth, and the fractured, have equal variety.</s> <s id="s206">Both have their bold projections-- both hang alike over their bases-- are rifted into chasms-- and shoot sometimes into horizontal, and sometimes into diagonal strata.</s></p>
<p><s id="s207">The natural colour of rocks is either grey, or red. We have of each kind in <enamex  sw="w31154" name="Large admin unit">England</enamex>; and both are beautiful: but the grey rock,( which is the common species in this scenery) makes the finer contrast with the foliage either of summer, or of autumn.</s></p>
<p><s id="s208">I call red, and grey the natural colours of rocks; but more properly they are the ground only of a variety of tints.</s> <s id="s209">These tints arise from weeds, mosses, and lychens of various kinds, which uniting together on the surface of a rock, often make a rich, and very harmomonious assemblage of colouring; and the painter, who does not attend to these minutiae( we are considering fore-grounds) loses half the beauty of the original.</s></p>
<p><s id="s210">Among these lychens, the white species is the least pleasing.</s> <s id="s211">When mixed with other tints, it may form an agreeable contrast: and even, when it borrows no aid of this kind, if it be sparingly, and happily introduced, it may add a beauty to the natural colour of the grey rock, by giving it the brilliancy of a few sharp touches.</s> <s id="s212">But when it prevails; and spreads, like a bald leprous scab, over a whole surface; it's mealy hue is very disgusting, unless it be thrown into shadow, or supported by some mass of foliage, or other vivid tint in contact with it.</s></p>
<p><s id="s213">Besides the species of rocks just described, there is another, called the cragg; which conveys the idea of a rock roughly pounded.</s> <s id="s214">With these shattered fragments whole sides of mountains are often covered; down which they appear continually to shiver.</s> <s id="s215">This species is very <enamex sw="w32589" long="-2.421557122390574" lat="53.29060765310844" type="civil" gazref="unlock:13406245" name="Tabley Inferior CP" conf="1.359424193">inferior</enamex> to former.</s> <s id="s216">It wants that breadth of surface, which gives dignity to an object.</s> <s id="s217">In a distance indeed, which melts the fragments into one mass, the effect is good: but in the situation, in which we are now considering rocks, as the appendages of a fore-ground, the cragg is meanly circumstanced.</s></p>
<p><s id="s218">The cascade, which is the next object of our observation, may be divided into the broken, and the regular fall.</s></p>
<p><s id="s219">The first belongs most properly to the rock; whose projecting fragments, impeding the water, break it into pieces-- dash it into foam-- and give it all the spirit, and agitation, which that active element is capable of receiving.</s> <s id="s220">-- Happy is the pencil, which can seize the varieties, and brilliancy of water under this circumstance.</s></p>
<p><s id="s221">In the regular fall the water meets no obstruction; but pours down, from the higher grounds to the lower, in one splendid sheet.</s></p>
<p><s id="s222">Each kind hath it's beauties; but, in general, the broken fall is more adapted to a small body of water; and the regular to a large one.</s> <s id="s223">The small body of water has nothing to recommend it, but it's variety and bustle: where-as the large body has a dignity of character to maintain.</s> <s id="s224">To fritter it in pieces would be to destroy in a degree the grandeur of it's effect.</s> <s id="s225">Were the <enamex sw="w33849" long="-79.05087760000001" lat="43.0939445" type="other" gazref="unlock:7869108" name="Niagara Falls Memorial Parking Ramp Heliport" conf="0.7630770932">Niagara</enamex> thus broken, at least if some considerable parts of it were not left broad and sheety, it might be a grand scene of confusion; but it could not be that vast, that uniform, and simple object, which is most capable of expressing the idea of greatness.</s></p>
<p><s id="s226">As there a few considerable rivers in the romantic country, we are now examining, the most beautiful cascades,( which are innumerable) are generally of the broken kind.</s> <s id="s227">The regular falls( of which also there are many) are objects of little value.</s> <s id="s228">Tho they are sometimes four of five hundred feet in height; yet they appear only like threads of silver at a distance; and like mere spouts at hand; void both of grandeur, and variety.</s> <s id="s229">-- And yet, in heavy rains, some of them must be very noble, if we may judge from their channels, which often shew great marks of violence.</s> <s id="s230">-- But I was never fortunate enough to see any of them in these moment of wildness.</s></p>
<p><s id="s231">These two kinds of cascades, the broken, and the regular, may be combined.</s> <s id="s232">If the weight of water be small, it is true, it will admit only the broken fall: but if it be large, it may with propriety admit a combination of both: and these combinations may be multiplied into each other with endless variety.</s></p>
<p><s id="s233">The regular fall admits also another mode of variety by forming itself into what may be called the successive fall; in which the water, instead of making one continued shoot, falls through a succession of different stories.</s> <s id="s234">Of this kind are many of the mountain-cascades in this country, which are often very beautiful; especially where the stages are deranged; and the water seeks it's way from one stage to another.</s></p>
<p><s id="s235">This is the species of cascade, which was the great object of imitation in all the antiquated water-works of the last age.</s> <s id="s236">Our fore-fathers admired the successive fall; and, agreeably to their awkward mode of imitation, made the water descend a regular flight of stone-stairs.</s></p>
<p><s id="s237">Before we conclude the subject of cascades, it may be observed, that, as in other objects of beauty, so in this, proportion must be a regulating principle.</s> <s id="s238">I shall not be so precise as to say, what is the exact proportion of an elegant cascade.</s> <s id="s239">Nor is it necessary.</s> <s id="s240">The eye will easily see the enormity of disproportion, where it exists in any great degree: and that is enough.</s> <s id="s241">Thus when a mountain-cascade falls four or five hundred feet, and is perhaps scarce two yards broad; every eye must see the disproportion: as it will also, when the whole breadth of some large river falls only two or three feet.</s> <s id="s242">Both would be more beautiful, if their falls held a nearer proportion to their quantities of water.</s></p>
<p><s id="s243">The last species of fore-grounds are vallies; with regard to which it must be remarked first, that narrow contracted vallies only are meant.</s> <s id="s244">The open valley must class itself among objects of distant scenery.</s></p>
<p> <s id="s245">Let it be observed, that the terms vale, and valley; denote universally, through this work, the greater, and smaller scenes of the same kind.</s> <s id="s246">I consider valley as the diminutive of vale.</s></p>
<p><s id="s247">It must secondly be remarked, that even contracted valleys are not purely of the nature of fore-grounds, but participate of distance.</s> <s id="s248">One side-screen must necessarily be a little removed, if you would give your scenery the advantage of perspective.</s></p>
<p><s id="s249">These things being premised, we may consider the valley as a species of fore-ground; the ingredients of which Spencer hath given us in very few words.</s></p>
<p><s id="s250">Through woods, and mountains wild they came at last Into a pleasant dale, that lowly lay Betwixt two hills, whose high heads over placed, The valley did with cool shade overcast: Through midst thereof a little river rolled.</s></p>
<p><s id="s251">These ingredients admit great variety in composition.</s> <s id="s252">The sides of the valley may be high, or low; rocky, or woody; smooth, or full of jutting promontories: and these variations again may play into each other with a thousand interchanges.</s></p>
<p><s id="s253">When we find a concurrence of beautiful circumstances in these scenes-- when their sides are well proportioned, and picturesquely adorned-- and especially when they are so fortunate as to open on a rich distance; a lake bounded by a rocky mountain; or any other interesting object, they form a landscape of a very pleasing kind.</s></p>
<p><s id="s254">The rivers also with which these vallies scarce ever fail of being adorned, have the same variety as the hills; and may, now and then, be introduced very happily to assist the fore-ground.</s> <s id="s255">They are pure chrystalline streams-- generally sparkling over beds of pebbles-- often tumbling, and foaming over the ledges of rocks-- and forming, through the whole of their course, a continuation of little bustling cascades.</s></p>
<p><s id="s256">Nearly allied to the contracted valley, is, what in this country, is called a gill; in others, a dell. It is a narrow cleft, winding between two rocky precipices; and overgrown with wood, which closes at the top, and almost excludes the day.</s> <s id="s257">Through the bottom foams a torrent.</s> <s id="s258">You hear it sounding in it's fall from one rocky stage to another: but it is rarely visible.</s></p>
<p><s id="s259">These romantic spots are generally impervious.</s> <s id="s260">When they are a little more open, so as to allow a narrow foot-path to stray among them, they are the most beloved haunts of solitude and meditation; and of all the parts of this delightful scenery, afford the most refreshing refuge from noon-tide heat.</s></p>
<p><s id="s261">Such were the scenes the poet panted after, when they drew from his soul, oppressed by the languor of a summer-sun, that ardent aspiration;</s></p>
<p><s id="s262">-- O quis me gelidis in vallibus Haemi Sistat, et ingenti ramorum protegat umbrâ!</s></p>
<p><s id="s263">How intimately acquainted with these scenes he was, his own very accurate desriptions shew.</s></p>
<p><s id="s264">-- Densis hunc frondibus atrum Urget utrimque latus nemoris, medioque fragosus Dat sonitum saxis, et torto vertice torrens.</s></p>
<p> <s id="s265">Dat sonitum, says this accurate observer of nature; remarking in the expression, that the torrent was an address to the ear, not to the eye.</s></p>

<p><s id="s272">We have now examined the materials, of which the magnificent scenery of this country is composed-- the distant mountain-- the lake-- and the fore-ground: but a few general observations on these materials, as united in composition, may perhaps throw some new and picturesque lights on the whole.</s></p>
<p><s id="s273">In many countries much grander scenes are exhibited, than these,-- mountains more magnificent, and lakes more extensive: yet, it is probable there are few, in which the several objects are better proportioned; and united with more beauty.</s></p>
<p><s id="s274">In <enamex  sw="w41111" name="Large admin unit">America</enamex> the lakes are seas; and the country on their banks, being removed of course to a great distance, can add no accompaniments.</s></p>

<p><s id="s284">In the mean time, with all this magnificence and beauty, it cannot be supposed, that every scene, which these countries present, is correctly picturesque. In such immense bodies of rough-hewn matter, many irregularities, and even many deformities, must exist, which a practised eye would wish to correct.</s> <s id="s285">Mountains are sometimes crouded-- their sides are often bare, when contrast requires them to be wooded-- promontories form the water-boundary into acute angles-- and bays are contracted into narrow points, instead of swelling into ample basons.</s></p>
<p><s id="s286">In all these cases the imagination is apt to whisper, What glorious scenes might here be made, if these stubborn materials could yield to the judicious hand of art!-- And, to say the truth, we are sometimes tempted to let the imagination loose among them.</s></p>

<p><s id="s317">If the imagination be thus fired by these romantic scenes even in their common state, how much more may we suppose it wrought on, when they strike us under some extraordinary circumstance of beauty, or terror-- in the tranquility of a calm, or the agitation of a storm?</s></p>
<p><s id="s318">Some scenes, particularly of the sylvan kind, are perhaps best suited to a calm.</s> <s id="s319">They receive their principal beauty from the richness of the objects; which is improved by chearful and splendid lights.</s></p>

<p><s id="s323">But there are some scenes in nature, which are adapted to both circumstances-- none more, than the scenery of lakes-- none perhaps so much.</s></p>
<p><s id="s324">During five days, which we spent among the lakes, we saw one of them only, and that but once, under the circumstance of a perfect calm-- when there was neither wind to ruffle, nor cloud to obscure, the resplendency of the surface-- when we saw the poet's description literally translated--</s></p>

<p><s id="s326">If an artificial mirror, a few inches long, placed opposite to a door, or a window, occasions often very pleasing reflections; how noble must be the appearance, when an area of many leagues in circumference, is formed into one vast mirror; and this mirror surrounded by a combination of great, and beautiful objects?</s> <s id="s327">The majestic repose of so grand, so solemn, and splendid a scene raises in the mind a sort of enthusiastic calm, which spreads a mild complacence over the breast-- a tranquil pause of mental operation, which may be felt, but not desribed;</s></p>

<p><s id="s329">Other adventitious circumstances, of less value in themselves, but in union very picturesque, add new life, and beauty to so still a scene-- groups of cattle in various parts, driven by the heats of noon, along the shores of the lake-- and fishing-boats extending their nets in dotted circles, and forming tremulous reflections from their flaccid sails.</s></p>
<p><s id="s330">When we take a view of such a glorious scene in all it's splendor, we regret, that it should ever be deformed by the rough blasts of tempest: and yet I know not, whether, under this latter circumstance, it may not have a still greater power over the imagination. Every little idea is lost in the wild uproar and confusion of such a scene.</s></p>
<p><s id="s331">Nor is it in this disturbed state, less an object of picturesque beauty. The sky floating with broken clouds-- the mountains half obscured by driving vapours; and mingling with the sky in awful obscurity-- the trees straining in the blast-- and the lake stirred from the bottom, and whitening every rocky promontory with it's foam; are all objects highly adapted to the pencil.</s></p>
<p><s id="s332">In the midst of the tempest, if a bright sunbeam should suddenly break out; and in Shakespear's language, light up the storm, the scenery of an agitated lake, thus assisted by the powers of contrast, affects both the imagination, and the eye, in a still greater degree.</s> <s id="s333">Some broad mountain-side, catching a mass of light, produces an astonishing effect amidst the leaden gloom, which surrounds it.</s> <s id="s334">Perhaps a sunbeam, half - suffused in vapour, darting between two mountains, may stretch along the water in a lengthened gleam, just as the skiff passes to receive the light upon it's swelling sail: while the sea-gull, wheeling along the storm, turns it's silvery side, strongly illumined, against the bosom of some lurid cloud; and by that single touch of opposition, gives double darkness to the rising tempest.</s></p>
<p><s id="s335">Compared with such scenes, how inanimate do the subjects of Canaletti appear!-- how flat his square canals, and formal street-perspective; when opposed to spreading lakes, and sweeping mountains!-- the puny labours of men, to the bold, irregular scenery of nature!

<p><s id="s350">The lake too is subject to something of the same kind of emotion; which the inhabitants of the country call a bottom-wind. Often, when all is calm, and resplendent around; as the boat is plying it's steady way; the boatman will descry at a distance( happy that it is so) a violent ebullition of the water.</s> <s id="s351">He will see it heave and swell; forced upwards by some internal convulsion; and suffering all the agitation of a storm.</s> <s id="s352">But as soon as the confined air has spent it's force, the agitated surface immediately subsides.</s></p>
<p><s id="s353">Of these bottom-winds also we meet with frequent accounts: particularly in some of the Sweedish lakes, which are very subject to them.</s></p>
<p><s id="s354">Something of this kind, seems to have given Spencer an idea, which he introduces in his idle lake:</s></p>
<p><s id="s355">The waves come rolling, and the billows roar, Outrageously as they engaged were: But not one puff of wind there did appear.</s></p>
<p><s id="s356">Often also a vast body of water, collected in the entrails of a mountain, it is said, will force a way through it's side; and rushing down the declivity, take it's course through the valley; where it is not uncommon to see the marks of it's devastation.</s></p>
<p><s id="s357">The same effects are sometimes produced by water-spouts, which in countries like these, are collected, as at sea, and fall upon mountains.</s></p>
<p><s id="s358">The avalanche, or fall of snow, is common here too, as in other mountainous countries.</s> <s id="s359">Inundations also are occasioned by it's sudden melting.</s></p>
<p><s id="s360">But the fall of cliffs, and large fragments of mountains, loosened by rain, and frost, produces one of the greatest scenes of terror, which belongs to this romantic country; and to which we are chiefly indebted for that variety of fractured rock, and broken ground, which are among it's greatest ornaments.</s> <s id="s361"><enamex  sw="w55234" name="Not a placename">Virgil</enamex> has given us a description of this kind in great perfection.</s></p>

<p><s id="s511">-- sporting with quick glance Shew to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold.</s></p>
<p><s id="s512">How far the transparency of water is an addition to a scene, I cannot take upon me to say.</s> <s id="s513">Most of the lakes in <enamex  sw="w75007" name="Large admin unit">Scotland</enamex>, which I saw, are of a mossy-tinctured hue; and yet had their full effect in landscape.</s> <s id="s514">-- As a detached object however the transparent lake is incomparably the most beautiful.</s> <s id="s515">I should suppose also, that the more brilliant the water is, the more brilliant are the reflections.</s></p>
<p><s id="s516">Among the great variety of fish, which inhabit the extensive waters of this lake, the char is the most remarkable.</s> <s id="s517">It is near twice the size of a herring.</s> <s id="s518">It's back is of an olive-green: it's belly of a light vermilion; softening in some parts into white; and changing into a deep red, at the insertion of the fins.</s></p>
<p><s id="s519">A parcel of char, just caught and thrown together into the luggage-pool of a boar, makes a pleasant harmony of colouring.</s> <s id="s520">The green olive-tint prevails; to which a spirit is here and there given by a light blush of vermilion; and by a strong touch of red, if a fin happen to appear.</s> <s id="s521">These pleasing colours are assisted by the bright silvery lights, which play over the whole; for nothing reflects light more beautifully than the scales of fish.</s></p>
<p><s id="s522">Char are caught only in the winter-season, when twenty dozen in a day, are sometimes taken by a single boat.</s> <s id="s523">In summer they retire to the rocky caves below, some of which are said to be unfathomable: nor do they breed in any lake, in which such deep recesses are not found.</s></p>
<p><s id="s524">The char-fishing is a very profitable branch of trade to the proprietors of the lake.</s> <s id="s525">The whole area of it is divided into five districts.</s> <s id="s526">An invisible line crosses the surface from crag to crag-- a limit, which the fisherman correctly knows.</s> <s id="s527">But tho the space of each fishery is nearly equal, yet the produce is otherwise; the fish running in shoals sometimes in one part of the lake, and sometimes in another.</s> <s id="s528">-- When the farmer rents land, he can judge of his bargain by the surface.</s> <s id="s529">When he rents water, he must take his chance.</s></p>
<p><s id="s530">But fish are not the only inhabitants of this lake.</s> <s id="s531">Innumerable flights of water-fowl frequent it's extensive plain.</s> <s id="s532">The naturalist may declare their names, and classes: the painter has only to remark the variety of forms, in which they appear-- sometimes sitting in black groups upon the water, rising and sinking with the waves: at other times in the air, circling the lake in figured files; or with hesitating wing seizing some station on it's banks, or surface.</s> <s id="s533">-- With regard to these minute ap - pendages of landscape, let me only suggest, that birds should never be introduced upon the wing, near the eye.</s> <s id="s534">Quick motion, of any kind, represented, is an absurdity: and the longer you look, the more absurd it becomes.</s> <s id="s535">But at a little distance the motion of a bird appears so slow, that the eye will endure a degree of improbability in the representation of it.</s></p>
<p><s id="s536">I have only to add, that this magnificent piece of water suffers little change, in appearance, from seasons; but preserves the dignity of it's character under all circumstances; seldom depressed, and as seldom raised above it's ordinary level-- Even in the most violent rains, when the country is drenched in water, the mountains pour down floods through new channels; the lake maintains the same equal temper; and tho it may spread a few yards over it's lowest shores( which is the utmost it does) yet it's increase is seldom the object of observation: nor does the severity of the greatest drought make any considerable alternation in it's bounds.</s> <s id="s537">Once,( it is recorded,) it rose seven feet in perpendicular height.</s> <s id="s538">It's boundaries would then certainly appear inlarged; but this was a very uncommon case.</s></p>

<p><s id="s921">To those, who are accustomed to mountains, these perpendicular motions may be amusing: but to us, whose ideas were less elevated, they seemed rather peculiar.</s> <s id="s922">And yet there is something unmanly in conceiving a difficulty in traversing a path, which, we were told, the women of the country would ascend on horseback, with their panniers of eggs, and butter, and return in the night.</s> <s id="s923">To move upwards, keeping a steady eye on the objects before us, was no great exercise to the brain: but it rather gave it a rotation to look back on what was past-- an to see our companions below clinging, as it appeared, to the mountain's side; and the rising breasts and bellies of their horses, straining up a path so steep, that it seemed, as if the least false step would have carried them rolling many hundred yards to the bottom.</s></p>
<p><s id="s924">We had another apprehension; that of mistaking our way.</s> <s id="s925">If a mist had suddenly overspread the mountain, which is a very common incident, we might have wandered all night: for we had not the precaution to take a guide.</s> <s id="s926">The question we asked of the peasant, at the bottom of the mountain;" Which way to Watenlath?" we found was a very improper one.</s> <s id="s927">We should have asked, in what direction we were to seek it?</s> <s id="s928">For way there was none; except here and there a blind path; which being itself often bewildered, of course, served only to bewilder us.</s> <s id="s929">The inhabitants pay little attention to paths: they steer along these wilds by landmarks, which to us were unknown.</s></p>
<p><s id="s930">At length however, after a painful perpendicular march of near two miles, and many a breathing pause, which our horses required, we gained the top.</s> <s id="s931">Here we expected at least to be rewarded by an amusing prospect over the neighbouring country.</s> <s id="s932">But in this too we were disappointed.</s> <s id="s933">We found ourselves in the midst of a bog, with still higher grounds around us: so that after all our toil, we had a view only of a vile circumscribed waste.</s></p>

Not only the design, and composition, but the very strokes of nature's pencil might be traced through the whole scene; every fractured rock, and every hanging shrub, which adorned it, was brought within the compass of the eye: each touch so careless, and yet so determined: so wildly irregular; and yet all conducing to one whole.</s></p>
<p><s id="s951">When we arrived at the close of the valley, the grandeur of the scene increased.</s> <s id="s952">It opened into an amphitheatre, the area of which, like the valley, that led to it, was contracted; scarce containing the circumference of a mile: but the mountains, which invironed it, were grand and beautiful.</s></p>
<p><s id="s953">In most of the scenes we had passed, we were obliged to look for contrast in the different modes of desolation: but here barrenness was contrasted with all the tints of vegetation.</s> <s id="s954">The mountains in front, and on the left, were covered with wood, which mantled from the top to the bottom.</s> <s id="s955">Those on the right were barren; yet broken so variously, as even in themselves to make a contrast.</s> <s id="s956">We admire the ruins of a Roman amphitheatre: but what are the most magnificent of the works of art, compared with such an amphitheatre as this?</s> <s id="s957">Were the <enamex sw="w135128" long="12.49231" lat="41.89018" type="manual_update"  gazref="ZZSH00043" name="Colosseum" conf="99991">Colosseum</enamex> itself brought hither, and placed within this area, the grandeur of the idea would be lost; and the ruin, magnificent as it is, would dwindle into the ornament of a scene.</s></p>

<p><s id="s965">Tho we had seen the fall of Lodoar from the bottom, we had a curiosity to see how it appeared from the top; and dismounting, we contrived, by winding round the thickets, and clinging to the projections of the rocks, to get a dangerous peep down the abyss.</s> <s id="s966">There was nothing picturesque in the view, but something immensely grand.</s> <s id="s967">We stood now above those two cheeks of the chasm, through which the water forced it's way; and which in the morning, when seen from the bottom, appeared towering to a great height, and were the most interesting parts of the view.</s> <s id="s968">But amidst the greatness of the objects, which now surrounded them they were totally lost; appearing less than warts upon those vast limbs of nature, to which they adhered.</s></p>
