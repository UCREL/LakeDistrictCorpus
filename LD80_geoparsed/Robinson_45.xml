<p><s id="s1695">" The abbey, which was formerly of such magnitude as nearly to fill up the breadth of the glen, is built of a pale red stone, dug from the neighbouring rocks, now changed by time and weather to a tint of dusky brown, which accords well with the hues of plants and shrubs that every where emboss the mouldering arches.</s></p>

<p><s id="s1699">" As, soothed by the venerable shades, and the view of a more venerable ruin, we rested opposite to the eastern window of the choir, where once the high altar stood, and, with five other altars, assisted the religious pomp of the scene; the images and manners of the times that were past rose to reflection.</s> <s id="s1700">The midnight procession of monks, clothed in white, and bearing lighted tapers, appeared to the mind's eye issuing to the choir through the very doorcase, by which such processions were wont to pass from the cloisters to perform the matin service, when, at the moment of their entering the church, the deep chanting of voices was heard, and the organ swelled a solemn peal.</s> <s id="s1701">To fancy, the strain still echoed feebly among the arcades, and died in the breeze among the woods, the rustling leaves mingling with the close.</s> <s id="s1702">It was easy to imagine the abbot and the officiating priests seated beneath the richly-fretted canopy of the four stalls, that still remain entire in the southern wall, and high over which is now perched a solitary yew tree, a black funeral memento to the living of those who once sat below.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1703">" Of a quadrangular court on the west side of the church, three hundred and thirty - four feet long, and one hundred and two feet wide, little vestige now appears, except the foundation of a range of cloisters that formed its western boundary, and under the shade of which the monks, on days of high solemnity, passed in their customary procession round the court.</s> <s id="s1704">What was the belfry is now a huge mass of detached ruin, picturesque from the loftiness of its shattered arches, and the high inequalities of the ground within them, where the tower that once crowned this building, having fallen, lies in vast fragments, now covered with earth and grass, and no longer distinguishable but by the hillock they form.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1705">" The school-house, a heavy structure attached to the boundary wall on the south, is nearly entire, and the walls, particularly of the portal, are of enormous thickness; but, here and there, a chasm discloses the staircases that wind within them to the chambers above.</s> <s id="s1706">The school-room below shows only a stone bench, that extends round the walls, and a low stone pillar on the eastern corner, on which the teacher's pulpit was formerly fixed.</s> <s id="s1707">The lofty vaulted roof is scarcely distinguishable by the dusky light admitted through one or two narrow windows placed high from the ground, perhaps for the purpose of confining the scholar's attention to his book.</s></p>
