</p>
<p><s id="s8">In memory of my fellow-labourer and acceptable contributor in attempting to perpetuate the <enamex  sw="w350" name="Large admin unit">Cumberland</enamex> dialect in its purity, and of the old-standing friendship, I had the happiness to enjoy during the life of the late Dr. Alexander Craig Gibson, this volume is dedicated to his amiable and much respected relict; as another, among many, memorials of his great skill in portraying the habits and feelings of the humbler classes of the people of this country and its borders; and of the admirable talent displayed in his" Laal Dinah Grayson,"" Bobby Banks' Bodderment," and numerous other unapproachable effusions in our quaint and quiet dialect.</s></p>

<p><s id="s11">Introduction.</s> </p>
<p><s id="s12">At the risk of overstocking the market, now when so many writers exercise their pens on my native dialect,( and there are only few who do not try to make our broad dialect broader still), I again venture before the public in practically applying the contents of The Glossary of the Words and Phrases of <enamex  sw="w1237" name="Large admin unit">Cumberland</enamex>.</s></p>
<p><s id="s13">Trifling as the contents of this volume may seem to some, the collection has been made with a view to perpetuate a remembrance of local traditions, and of the manners and customs of old times, with occasional illustrations of character exhibited in the sayings and doings of the people of <enamex  sw="w1539" name="Large admin unit">Cumberland</enamex>, and occasionally of its immediate borders.</s> <s id="s14">An experience of more than threescore and ten years has made matters of this nature very familiar; and many old people will be able, from personal recollection, to confirm the correctness of most of what is introduced.</s></p>
<p><s id="s15">It is not to be expected that the whole contents of the volume will be found entertaining to every one who may chance to read it, for tastes vary; but it is hoped that all may find something pleasing in it, and that none may find anything of an objectionable character.</s></p>
<p><s id="s16">Some of the anecdotes may be interesting from their connection with the names of persons living, or with localities.</s> <s id="s17">Some may lose a portion of their interest to the rising generations in the lapse of time, but all will aid in preserving a record of local legends and unwritten tales which are fast passing into oblivion; and they may also tend to enliven the hearth of many a family in the dullness of a long winter's evening.</s> <s id="s18">If used in moderation, the reading may last over many weeks, and need interfere with no moral, household, or other duties in the rehearsal.</s> <s id="s19">Some three or four of the anecdotes have appeared in the local papers, and are inserted here, because they essentially belong to the county, and are worthy of revival.</s> <s id="s20">Some anecdotes may lose their point after the existence of the generation during which they took their rise; and that circumstance should be taken into account in reading a few of the following.</s></p>
<p><s id="s21">There is a certain connection between the tale and the teller, or the originator of an anecdote, which heightens the interest, and if this link be broken by the absence or death of the person most concerned, and the reader or listener does not happen to have been acquainted with the peculiarities or drollery of the party, the anecdote suffers in proportion: and many will suffer from being read, instead of being delivered by the originator with his own emphasis and action.</s></p>
<p><s id="s22">Some will be found of genuine wit.</s> <s id="s23">Many are ridiculous blunders, or simplicity personified; but all will aid in recording the manners and customs, or in furnishing illustrations of character, pertaining to the present, as well as to the times gone by.</s></p>
<p><s id="s24">More anecdotes and amusing speeches have had their origin among the simple-hearted, and the lowly of the slow-speaking Cumbrians, than have arisen from the more elevated classes.</s> <s id="s25">From the one may be reckoned the outflowing of the feelings of the heart, while the other may be, in a great measure, the result of education and re - search.</s> <s id="s26">The one is of sly humour or innocent simplicity, the other may be the offspring of wit or of higher learning.</s></p>
<p><s id="s27">Almost every village could contribute a good quota of anecdote; and many lone houses have been the repositories of amusing stories and legends, illustrative of rural life and manners.</s> <s id="s28">These, through the alterations in the style of living, and in the improved and constantly improving systems of education, with a continual widening of intercourse among all classes, to which the extension of railways largely contributes - these have, in some measure driven out, or have assisted to quell, as vulgar, the habit of repeating anecdotes; and thus, much of the domestic history of the county has been for ever lost.</s> <s id="s29">This collection may afford the means of acquainting the people of one end of the county with the sayings and doings of the inhabitants of the other.</s> <s id="s30">To those who have mingled much in the different grades of Cumbrian society, it need not be said that we are a quiet-spoken people.</s> <s id="s31">And the few who have not been dwellers with us, and who may have patience to wade through this fragmentary production, will find it true that unless under great excitement, we are not of the race that is wont to set the lakes on fire.</s> <s id="s32">An occasional burst of forcible language will occur, under strong influences; but the ordinary tenor of speech is of a retiring character.</s></p>
<p><s id="s33">It has not been without some effort and research that this collection has been brought together.</s> <s id="s34">Some can, in the exuberance of their memory, relate anecdote after anecdote, who cannot be prevailed upon to commit them to paper: and amid such abundance, there is no little difficulty in recollecting, and selecting, and writing in the racy style of a good narrator, such ones as may be acceptable to a reader, and doubtless many worthy of record are entirely lost in this way.</s></p>

<p><s id="s52">He kept hold of the gun with one hand and managed to swim with the other hand to the edge of the ice, and to lift his gun upon it.</s> <s id="s53">The ice breaking as he advanced he pushed his gun upon it before him; and partly swimming, and partly holding on by the edges till it broke, he contrived to advance after several breakings, to where the ice was strong enough to bear him.</s> <s id="s54">Raising himself on his elbows, by a sudden and venturous spring got on the sound ice once more, after travelling in the water more than a hundred yards in a keen frosty evening.</s> <s id="s55">But his troubles were not at an end, for by the bending of the edge of the ice when he was in the act of mounting it, his favorite gun slipped off and sank to the bottom.</s> <s id="s56">Not liking to make another plunge, although a good diver, he made the best of his way home where a party of young people were assembling by invitation for a dance; and without giving them any attention, or thinking of anything but of saving his gun, he ascended to the hayloft; and knowing the depth of water in which his gun lâid, selected a dry pole from the loft and tied it by the middle to a rope, and the rope to a stone; and hastening back, threw all into the lake together, as near to his gun as possible, and had the satisfaction to observe the pole float on the water over the place.</s> <s id="s57">He then went home and enjoyed himself with the party without mentioning his adventure to anyone.</s></p>
<p><s id="s58">The frost continued a few days, but did not freeze hard enough to permit his going to his pole.</s> <s id="s59">Confident in his expedient, he waited till thaw came: and then, with a boat, rowed to where he expected his pole-bouy, but found he had miscalculated: and that the ice, on breaking up, and being driven before the wind, had cut the cable which archored his buoy.</s> <s id="s60">The pole had floated down the lake; the rope had sunk, and the favorite gun still rests at the bottom of lake <enamex sw="w9939" long="-3.193601937631324" lat="54.67926476125776" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:15906" name="Bassenthwaite" conf="2.6">Bassenthwaite</enamex>.</s></p>

<p><s id="s1250">Old people of two generations ago have said it was a practice formerly with owners of cows subject to abortion( and which malady is often known to continue nearly three years in a herd), to watch for the first abortive calf shewing signs of life, and to dig a hole under the threshold of the byre, and bury the calf in it - alive, if possible; but there to bury it, alive or dead.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1251">A still more barbarous practice was to take the first living aborted calf, and at midnight to burn it alive.</s> <s id="s1252">It was allowable to despatch the calf with the aid of a pitchfork as soon as it was thrown into the fire.</s> <s id="s1253">If a cure was to be effected by this, the evil spirit which caused the disease would enter the byre or field where the cattle were, and in parting revenge would set the whole herd bellowing like to many mad creatures.</s> <s id="s1254">If in the byre, they would break loose, and a general fight would ensue during the burning.</s> <s id="s1255">If in the field, they would break through the hedges, galloping furiously, with heads and tails erect, bellowing and surrounding the fire; and woe be to the man who undertook the sacrifice if he had not time to secure his safety by flight.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1256">If so near as seven months to the natural period, the calf might be able to bawl lustily when the pitchfork was used; and in a still night this would be heard to a distance, and rouse the herd to fury.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1257">These operations were to be performed by one person alone, and no man would undertake it if he did not believe in it.</s> <s id="s1258">And believing that the evil spirit was to be present, and to take part in it, or at least to drive the cows mad for a time, it seems improbable that the mystic charm would be undertaken by any one; and it certainly would not be adopted in sport.</s></p>

<p><s id="s1452">From long experience and close observation of the ways of mankind, Mr. Sherwen had formed an opinion, and was not shy in declaring it, that we should only believe half of what we see, and nothing of what we hear; forgetting, at the same time, that himself was engaged in promulgating the doctrines of Christianity with an earnestness, he hoped, that none who heard him would disbelieve.</s></p>

<p><s id="s1838">It may be remarked that each kind of dog, if of pure breed, has a peculiar and distinct mode of attacking other animals, and especially sheep.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1839">The mastiff is now scarce and is commonly chained, and little known as a destroyer of sheep; and the bull dog is not often accused of that crime, because it is seldom allowed to ramble from the house or heel of the owner; and unless roused for a short course, both these are too slow of foot to do much harm.</s> <s id="s1840">They stop their prey by grasping the nose or some part of the head.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1841">The greyhound is more known as a destroyer of lambs than of sheep; and, with speed at command, its mode of attack is similar to that applied when in pursuit of the hare - that is, grasping the loins, or pitching the helpless animal into the air and seizing it by the back as it falls, and at once disabling it.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1842">The pointer and setter usually fasten on the sheep or lamb by the flank, and hold on till the victim can be overturned, or brought to a stand-still, when the operation is soon over.</s> <s id="s1843">These commonly make their attack in the daytime, and are, in general, the most destructive dogs among sheep, when they acquire a propensity for such tempting amusements; for their speed and endurance enables them to hold out for several hours at a stretch in their destructive career.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1844">The sheep dog is entitled to the credit of being the cleverest of the dog tribe, as a destroyer; for he goes about his work with more cunning than any other of his race, and it is seldom found out before much harm is done.</s> <s id="s1845">In some cases many months have elapsed ere the true culprit could be detected, so wary has he been in all his proceedings.</s> <s id="s1846">He takes his victim by the throat; overturns and throttles it at once.</s> <s id="s1847">In his mad excitement he often leaves the poor animal struggling in the throes of death, and hurries off to add other unfortunates to his crime.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1848">This dog, when at maturity, is seldom known to worry near home, or among the flock of his owner.</s> <s id="s1849">When once blooded he will sneak two or three miles away in the dark to a strange flock, and will sometimes entice a youngster along with him, and after a little play together, both attacking the same sheep, the older criminal at the throat, and the other wherever it can lay hold of; they soon make an end of the matter.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1850">In the excitement of the chase the young dog is apt to give an occasional bark or wilk, as it is termed; and to cause detection.</s> <s id="s1851">The old one never barks.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1852">It seldom happens that the hound takes to worrying sheep.</s> <s id="s1853">In the winter months he has his special duties to attend to, and these are more fascinating to him than the chase of a tarry coated sheep.</s> <s id="s1854">During the rest of the year he indulges in a habit of laziness; and, if liberally fed, his habit partly unfits him for preying on live mutton.</s> <s id="s1855">There are occasional exceptions to all these, but they are rare.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1856">Cross breeds and mongrel dogs have no settled mode of attack until well practiced in the business, and then each adopts a system of its own or varies it to suit the whim of the moment.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1857">The sheep dog commonly begins his sport about midnight; and after a lively hour or so of destructive amusement, rolls and rubs himself on the grass, and is found at home in the morning, as clean and tidy, and as unconcerned and ready for his breakfast and work, as if he had been all night in his kennel, or sleeping at the foot of the straw stack.</s> <s id="s1858">He seldom worries for a livelihood, or even partakes of the blood or flesh; and all his energy, for the time, seems to be expended in sport or excitement.</s> <s id="s1859">A clumsy whelp may come home towards morning with bloody marks on his head or legs, but he soon learns to know better, if not detected and hung.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1860">When a lad, the writer assisted in collecting and throwing into a disused pit, more than forty dead lambs in one morning.</s> <s id="s1861">This was the previous night's work of an idle cur, kept by a labouring man who had no use for it.</s> <s id="s1862">The miscreant was detected at his work in early morning, by the writer's father, who was on horseback and followed the dog over hedge and ditch, for a two mile course to its home, and had it grudgingly destroyed.</s> <s id="s1863">Three or four lambs had been worried on the same ground a few nights before, and all were bitten in the neck, and doubtless by the same dog.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1864">About two years previous to the above chase, the same horseman was inspecting his flock one morning, on another heaf( <enamex sw="w285464" name="Dean Common">Dean Common</enamex>), when he saw the sheep violently disturbed; and, on galloping up to them, found a strong pointer dog, so earnest in its work of destruction, that he could not beat it off while in the saddle; and on alighting to thrash it, the furious creature turned to attack him; and, during his momentary act of remounting, it fell to its bloody work again.</s> <s id="s1865">He then, in his excitement, attempted to ride it down, but it slipped aside from the horses feet; and in its extreme of fury would have continued to worry, but he chased it so close that it made off towards its home; and he followed it a distance of five miles, where he found its owner, who, being a surgeon, applied a safe and speedy remedy to it.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1866">On his return he found it had destroyed some and greatly injured several of his own sheep, and some belonging to his neighbours.</s> <s id="s1867">All of these were savagely torn in the flank; and some of the dead had their bowels protruding.</s> <s id="s1868">These were all old sheep, but no match for the enfuriated dog.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1869">Instances might be multiplied of extensive sheep worrying, and scarce a vale can be found without its tale of destruction; and some may enumerate several.</s> <s id="s1870">These more often occurred on the low moors than on the mountains.</s> <s id="s1871">On the fells large flocks were depastured: the dogs were fewer in number, were well broke, and had plenty of legitimate employment.</s> <s id="s1872">The low commons were stocked with a few sheep belonging to each small farm around; and each small farm kept one or more ill-trained curs, with little work for them to do.</s> <s id="s1873">These, if not closely watched, found sport in chasing sheep occasionally, and sport led on to mischief.</s> <s id="s1874">Happily such instances are less frequent now than fifty years ago.</s></p>
<p><s id="s1875">It is somewhat rare to have a dog possessed of the faculty and inclination to mark sheep that are buried under a deep snow drift.</s> <s id="s1876">Such dogs are of great value for that special purpose, but they become so wild with joy, in the act of releasing the sheep, that they would worry the excāvated animal there and then, if suffered; and are too apt to take up the business of worriers after their snowy duties are ended.</s></p>

<p><s id="s1890">No one knew to whom the dog had belonged, or whence he came; but being of a mongrel breed, and excessively shy, it was conjectured he had escaped from the chain of some gipsy troop.</s> <s id="s1891">He was a smooth haired dog, of a tawny mouse-colour, with dark streaks, in tiger-fashion, over his hide; and appeared to be a cross between mastiff and greyhound.</s> <s id="s1892">Strongly built and of good speed, being both well fed and well exercised, his endurance was very great.</s> <s id="s1893">His first appearance in the district was on or about the 10th May, 1810, when he was seen by Mr. Mossop, of <enamex sw="w290633" long="-3.442649018842001" lat="54.46312102830928" type="other" gazref="unlock:11299861" name="Thornholme" conf="2">Thornholme</enamex>, who was near, and noticed him as a stranger.</s> <s id="s1894">His worrying exploits followed soon after; and from that time till his being shot in September following, he was not known to have fed on anything but living mutton, or, at least, the flesh of lambs and sheep before the carcases had time to cool.</s> <s id="s1895">From one sheep he was scared during his feast, and when the shepherd examined the carcase, the flesh had been torn from the ribs behind the shoulder, and the still beating heart was laid bare and visible.</s> <s id="s1896">He was once seen to run down a fine ram at early dawn; and, without killing it, to tear out and swallow lumps of living flesh from the hind quarters of the tortured animal while it stood on its feet, without the power to resist or flee, yet with sufficient life to crawl forward on its fore legs.</s> <s id="s1897">He would sometimes wantonly destroy seven or eight sheep in one night; and all his work was done so silently that no one ever heard him either bark or growl.</s></p>

<p><s id="s1905">All through his career of depredation he was exceedingly cautious and provident in the selection of his resting places; most frequently choosing places where a good view was obtainable, and not seldom on the bare rock, where his dingy colour prevented his being descried on stealing away.</s> <s id="s1906">For a few weeks at first, it was thought, from his shy habits, that it would be easily possible to drive him out of the country.</s> <s id="s1907">But this was an entire fallacy; for he seemed to have settled down to the locality as his regal domain; and though many a time chased at full speed, for ten or fifteen miles right away, he was generally discovered, by his murderous deeds, to have returned during the first or second night following.</s></p>

<p><s id="s3019">In some manors the most valuable heriot on the premises, dead or alive, or the best belonging to the tenant in trust is claimed, whether on the premises or elsewhere: and within the memory of the writer, a horse of seventy pounds value was taken on the death of the lord from a customary tenant, although the estate itself was only worth about sixteen pounds a year, and did not belong to the tenant in trust at all, nor did he occupy the land.</s> <s id="s3020">He was merely a friend who had consented to allow his name to stand in the court books of the manor as representative of the true owner.</s> <s id="s3021">In some manors a heriot is only payable when the tenant in trust leaves a widow, and then as compensation to the lord for the loss of a man's military service.</s></p>
<p><s id="s3022">On such manors, the evasive custom of putting in a woman as tenant in trust has been resorted to, and then no widow is left at her death, and no heriot could be claimed.</s></p>

<p><s id="s3027">This custom is happily nearly obsolete.</s> <s id="s3028">In some manors where horses were obliged to be kept for military service, heriots were not claimed.</s></p>

<p><s id="s3032">In a few manors the tenants were bound to bring all the game they killed, to the lord or bailiff of the manor, under a penalty of three shillings and fourpence per head, and were then entitled to claim a specified price for each kind of game.</s></p>
<p><s id="s3033">Birds were held to be game in those days which are not esteemed as such now, and singular discrepancies in value are recorded: For instance, a halfpenny each was to be given for field-fares, throstles, lapwings, and ouzels; and a penny each for partridges and woodcocks.</s></p>
