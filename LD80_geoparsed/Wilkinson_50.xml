<p><s id="s43">The time was now approaching when we were to make our election what peak was to be visited in preference to the rest; but while we were thus debating and slowly ascending, we found on our right a great body of water lodged in the bosom of the mountain.</s> <s id="s44">Its surface was calm, and reflected the dark and towering crags that rose from its margin; which crags seemed to be the base of the eastern pyramid.</s> <s id="s45">With these impenetrable bars on our right, we turned to the left and kept still ascending, till we came to the foot of another prodigious rock, which we deemed the base of the middle Pike.</s> <s id="s46">The summit of the stupendous mountain we had ascended is crowned with three lofty pikes, all composed of terrific and perpendicular rocks, frowning with dreadful majesty.</s> <s id="s47">Seen from the valleys below, they appear to rise at no great distance from each other; but when the mountain is ascended, the traveller may toil with many a weary step ere his labours reach from one to another; and he may look with alarm on many a frightful precipice ere he ascend to the summit of their terrific pinnacles.</s> <s id="s48">That to the north-west seems the lowest, but most regular and conical; that to the south is next in elevation, but more broken and rugged.</s> <s id="s49">That to the east overlooks the rest, and indeed all these mountainous regions; and rises in masses of immense rocks that are beheld with horror, and whose forms cannot be ascertained.</s> <s id="s50">At a distance, the eye shapes them into somewhat regular forms; but exploring their tremendous recesses, the traveller is alarmed and bewildered.</s> <s id="s51">To these sublime and dreadful regions I ascended with my intrepid maids, and was the first to express anything like fear.</s> <s id="s52">Catherine, who feels a kindness for the whole creation, offered me her hand; while Elizabeth, with a courage I had never met with before, proposed to explore what remained, and, winding round the corner of a rock, presently ascended out of sight.</s> <s id="s53">I have felt pain from the absence of those I value; the absence of Elizabeth was terribly extended, and was accompanied with feelings of distress.</s> <s id="s54">From some situations at a great distance, <enamex sw="w9122" long="-3.118464887566315" lat="54.45756762847756" type="mtn" gazref="unlock:11191353" name="Langdale Pikes" conf="2.4">Langdale Pikes</enamex> had appeared like prodigious pillars: it somehow or other suddenly impressed me as if we were high up on the side of one of these pillars, and in danger of slipping down.</s> <s id="s55">Under these impressions, Elizabeth's absence was a period of dreadful suspense: I knew not whether she might be clambering up the cliffs above us, or falling down the precipices below;-- her sisters, too, began to think her long.</s> <s id="s56">But we were at length relieved by her calling to us from the cliffs over our heads.</s> <s id="s57">In her descent she had missed her way, and got on a shelf of rocks higher than that on which we sat.</s> <s id="s58">However, we soon got all together again, and joyfully eat our dinners amid these aerial halls of Nature.</s> <s id="s59">Who is there that need be discouraged at undertakings, however apparently arduous?</s> <s id="s60">For perhaps ten years I had projected an expedition to this alpine mountain, and this day it was accomplished: but who would ever have conceived that I should have been led on by such amiable conductors?</s></p>
<p><s id="s61">The clouds were now collecting in the south, which hastened our descent down the mountain; yet the threatened rain did not prevent our visiting the waterfall in Dungeon Gill; where, in a fissure of the mountain, and inclosed by gloomy rocks, a considerable stream is discovered tumbling from a lofty precipice into a deep and dark bason.</s> <s id="s62">Near the summit of, and over this cataract, a natural bridge is elegantly suspended.</s> <s id="s63">From the tremendous wall of rock, two lofty and pointed rocks project, between which an enormous mass of the same, in the form of a wedge, has found its way, and completes this sublime arch, which the stranger surveys with admiration, but shudders at the idea of passing.</s></p>

I suddenly heard the tread of a man's foot, which instantly occasioned a singular sensation, and threw my musing tranquillity into a kind of thrill, or even a chill.</s> <s id="s328">I instantly opened my eyes, and saw the man and I were passing one another.</s> <s id="s329">I spoke to him:-- and he replied;-- and I found by his accent he was an Irishman.</s> <s id="s330">I before mentioned I wanted to make an experiment; which was the ascertain the difference, if any, in perception between a very dark night, and having one's eyes fully closed.</s> <s id="s331">I now found the difference was most manifest.</s> <s id="s332">I clearly distinguished the trees around me, as by a faint moonlight, and had not the least difficulty the rest of my way home.</s> <s id="s333">Since the above I found it of advantage, in going from candlelight into a dark night, to shut my eyes for a few minutes.</s></p>
<p><s id="s334">Another powerful instance of the effects of darkness occurred nearly in the same place.</s> <s id="s335">I was making my way through the same wood in darkness and in silence, when I suddenly heard above my head a sound like a very mournful human voice.</s> <s id="s336">This threw an instant horror through my frame; which was, however, but of short continuance, for I instantly heard above my head the flapping of a prodigious number of wings.</s> <s id="s337">The fact was, at certain times of the year many thousand crows roost in this wood; and I believe the sound I heard was one of the crows on watch, giving the alarm; so I went on smiling at my fright.</s> <s id="s338">If I had not made the discovery, I should not have been well off with my imagination the rest of my way home.</s></p>
<p><s id="s339">The above temporary terror was from objects of sound.</s> <s id="s340">I could give instances of objects of sight equally appalling.</s> <s id="s341">Take the following as not the most striking, but the first that occurs:-- Travelling in a cloudy night, and no moon, along a shady lane, about a mile from my own house, I saw, as I thought, at a small distance, a pale coffin move slowly along the side of a hedge.</s> <s id="s342">I stopped, and it stopped; and then it proceeded forward, unattended and unsupported by any thing that I could see.</s> <s id="s343">After sacrificing long enough to fear, I collected all the courage that I could muster, and advanced slowly towards the strange sight; when it proved to be a poor horse, whose head and neck, and tail and legs, were black; but its body was white: and it was innocently seeking its food by the highway-side.</s> <s id="s344">I believe many of the objects of mysterious fear, if duly examined, would thus relax their terrors.</s></p>
<p><s id="s345">Visible appearance of supernatural agency has something of terror in it; for we are so far introduced to the world of spirits; and it is somewhat connected with religion: but it is a religious excrescence that ought to be removed.</s></p>
<p><s id="s346">To grow up under these unhappy impressions may be a serious affliction to many a sweet disposition and amiable mind.</s> <s id="s347">This harassing mental slavery ought to be got rid of; and I know no way more likely than for mothers, grandmothers, aunts, and those that have the care of children, to follow the example of a venerable matron, whose countenance was marked by a dignity and intelligence continued beyond eighty years of age.</s> <s id="s348">I lodged at her house and two of her grand - children playing at the door in the dark, came in with looks of great concern, and seriously announced they had seen a bogle!
