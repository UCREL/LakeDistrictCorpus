<p><s id="s35">Preface.</s>
</p>
<p><s id="s36">To guard against the severity of criticism, which I must expect, or the too partial praise of some of my friends that I might not deserve,( either of which would be unwelcome) I conceal myself under the signature of A Rambler.</s></p>
<p><s id="s37">This excursion was at the request of a friend, and I was so pleased with every thing I saw, I hope there are some few who will not be displeased with my manner of telling it; whatever I have written came warm from the imagination, with the views full before it.</s> <s id="s38">I have always been an admirer of the works of Nature, and I never saw them in such liberal features before: I have no fine houses, no fine paintings, no compliments to great people, to swell out my book with-- my portraits are cottagers, my pictures what Nature has lavished around them-- when I do praise a rich man, it shall never be on account of his wealth, but for those unremitting acts of philanthropy, those only deserving of esteem, that shower down in charity wherever it is wanted.</s></p>
<p><s id="s39">The inhabitants are as peaceful as their vallies, and seem to have no inclination to leave them: they even talk of their forefathers, and carry an oral account for several generations of any one who has been out of the common way.</s> <s id="s40">One man told us," My faither, gran-faither, an grait granfaither, fearmed yon lake, an I was naw leave this pleace for aw the world."-- This valley had no more than fourteen houses, and is so entombed in mountains, that only one chaise has been known to visit it.</s>  <s id="s41">-- Happy man! well dost thou prove that Nature impresses the strongest attachments where she is undisturbed, and that every thing around them grows in their minds, and becomes a necessary part of them.</s>  <s id="s42">-- Prithee, Mortal! dost not thou think this simple villager has given( in a few words) as practical proof of contentment as volumes could contain?</s></p>
<p><s id="s43">I feel that I have been too diffuse in description-- I much wished to correct it-- and have taken out more than I have added; but not finding myself to the task of self-criticism, most of my alterations became so formal, I was obliged to desist-- the weeds and flowers( if there are any) grow together, and they are before you in their first, unfinished dress.</s></p>
<p><s id="s44">Those who make the tour of the Lakes, and will examine any of the views I attempt to describe, if they see them from the points I did, and in the last week in July and the first week in August, making allowances for the fancies of Nature, or the pruning hand of man, may, perhaps, give me the credit of delineating faithfully; and they will be well repaid against any of my omissions, by finding out new beauties of their own: and I trust those who do not visit them, by taking the trouble of perusing this Ramble, will have some enlivening scenes and useful characters presented to them.</s></p>
<p><s id="s45">We were exactly one fortnight with constant fine weather, during which we walked upwards of two hundred and forty miles, besides boat and chaise conveyance; and what with admiring the wonders around us, writing them down, or storing them in my memory for an early morning's pen, I can truly say I enjoyed a noble hurry of imagination, and that I had not time to be idle.</s></p>
<p><s id="s46">The friend I accompanied was my guide; he had been at the Lakes before: his taste led him thither again, and I have to express myself singularly obliged for many features he pointed out which my mind had not taken in.</s> <s id="s47">He had" Mr West's Guide to the Lakes," but did not make use of it.</s> <s id="s48">Mr. West, I understand, was a scholar of warm fancy; he had studied their beauties minutely, and, from living near them, took time to be correct.</s> <s id="s49">I believe that gentleman has brought much company, and will always be recollected( for he is now no more!) as their best patron: I would with pleasure have read his book, if I had not been apprehensive it might have suppressed this, which does not merit the name of a Guide, and is only offered as a Journeying Companion.</s> <s id="s50">It was customary, I am told, to dash by them with an exclamation or two of" Oh! how fine"&amp; c.; or, as a gentleman said to Robin Partridge the day after we were upon <enamex sw="w5334" long="-2.907933804199639" lat="54.37599546506077" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:10204" name="Windermere" conf="2.6">Windermere</enamex>," Good God! how delightful!-- how charming!-- I could live here for ever!-- Row on, row on, row on;" and after passing one hour of exclamations upon the Lake, and half an hour at <enamex sw="w5533" long="-2.96358681023542" lat="54.4319364520582" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:11061737" name="Ambleside" conf="2.6">Ambleside</enamex>, he ordered his horses into his phaeton, and flew off to take( I doubt not) an equally flying view of <enamex sw="w5645" long="-3.1588" lat="54.6018" type="other" gazref="unlock:5828527" name="Derwentwater Hotel" conf="2">Derwentwater</enamex>.</s> <s id="s51">Robin Partridge, when he told us of it, asked us if we thought" the gentleman was as composed as he sud be?"</s></p>
<p><s id="s52">It is now so meritoriously the fashion to make this tour, I dare almost say it will be thought want of taste not to be able to speak about it; for it only wants to be made, to have the preference of every summer excursion in the kingdom.</s> <s id="s53">Had these beauties been formed in a foreign land, they would have been long ago more known; but since a once-boasted, though now unfortunate, part of the Continent is become a scene of horror and devastation, they may be thought worthy attention.</s>  <s id="s54">-- I was telling a Grand Tourist where I had been, and he dashed off to <enamex  sw="w6327" name="Large admin unit">Switzerland</enamex>.</s> <s id="s55">We have no reason to depreciate other countries in commending our own; but Nature has sported in such a variety At Home, no views can exceed them in that delightful miniature which the eye takes in, without being either glutted by expanse, or Disgusted by deformity.</s></p>
