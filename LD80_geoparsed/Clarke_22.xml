<p><s id="s18">Introduction.</s>
</p>
<p><s id="s19">I. It generally affords some degree of amusement, to those who possess an extensive acquaintance with general history, to observe the minute causes from whence important events have so often derived their origin.</s> <s id="s20">For if trifles often affect the minds of the greatest men, and of the greatest multitudes; the first by their situation, and the latter by their bulk, occasion those affairs in the world which we characterize by the name of Important; whilst, in the greatness of their effects, their insignificant original causes are generally forgotten.</s> <s id="s21">Yet every investigating faculty of the human mind is interested, when an opportunity offers of deducing, by a direct channel, large and extensive consequents, from a combination of circumstances, either overlooked because they are common, or slighted because they are trivial; but such as, when united and urged in a particular direction, thrust themselves abroad into the world, and become of consequence to mankind: even when no such direct channel of inquiry offers itself, we are apt enough to be pleased, if, by comparison and analogy, we can draw such inferences as Curiosity at least may warrant, and Reason not disavow.</s></p>
<p><s id="s22">Ii.</s> <s id="s23">When we wish for the leading parts of a distinguished character, we recur to private anecdotes of the life to which it belongs; are fond of tracing the connection between these and its more noted exploits, and fancy we see some uniform motive still exerting itself, though in different quarters, and on a diversity of objects; proportioning its powers to the nature or magnitude of its toil, and only varying as its employments vary.</s> <s id="s24">The same wish operates with respect to nations at large: we aim at their leading motives, and find it easy to call such or such an action the natural result of such an humour, or such a prejudice.</s></p>
<p><s id="s25">Iii.</s> <s id="s26">To say positively for what particular reason the people of different countries have adopted this or that custom, will always be beyond the reach of the keenest speculation.</s> <s id="s27">some, it is likely, nature hath originally given to all; others, climate and circumstances may have engrafted: but the greatest part must be referred to that complex and obscure variety of intervening causes, to which, because we cannot develope their particular relation, nor trace them through their intricate mazes, we have affixed the general epithet of Chance.</s> <s id="s28">These again, in a sort of permutation, have produced an infinite number of distinctions, of which local history can only take in a part at a time: however, in every country some particular things may be found, which on comparison appear similar to those of another; yet are of such a kind, that they cannot easily be attributed to nature or climate alone, but bear the marks of a commerce and interchange, that has some time subsisted, either directly, or by the mediation of others.</s> <s id="s29">If" I will throw a stone upon your cairn," was an expression of friendship amongst our forefathers, we, of course, refer it to their scythian ancestors; yet these tumuli, which we call Cairns and <enamex sw="w4250" long="-2.729796664668882" lat="54.28976044087825" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:11071065" name="Barrows Green" conf="2.6">Barrows</enamex>, are found to have been in old times amongst the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans; and indeed what else are the Egyptian pyramids?</s> <s id="s30">But who would have thought that these same cairns or barrows, and this same custom, should have existed beyond the utmost eastern limits of <enamex  sw="w4524" name="Large admin unit">Asia</enamex>, in the barren island of Oonalashka?</s> <s id="s31">Again: The crisping, perfuming, and powdering of hair, are things which have been in former ages as well as this; yet one rather startles at hearing that they are common to unknown savages on the opposite side of the world, and beyond the southern tropic.</s> <s id="s32">Painting seems, by all wild nations, to have been first applied to their own bodies; and it is hard to determine, that the custom has not crept down, through all the different stages of civilization, from those times to our own.</s> <s id="s33">That the component parts of dead bodies should be united at a certain period, and become immortal, was a tenet amongst the Greeks, as well as amongst Jews and Christians.</s> <s id="s34">The belief of a chaos, of a rebellion in Heaven, of a general deluge, and of several other things, have been common to religions vastly remote from each other.</s> <s id="s35">There is a strong resemblance between the stories of Joseph and Bellerophon, of <enamex sw="w5462" long="-84.4282583" lat="34.9536916" type="other" gazref="unlock:6952401" name="Jeptha Patterson Prospect" conf="0.689615277">Jeptha</enamex> and Idomeneus.</s> <s id="s36">The funeral howl has been raised in almost every quarter of the earth, and human supersstition has always had its fausti and nefausti dies.</s> <s id="s37">Many English words, with their native meaning attached to them, have migrated into <enamex sw="w5707" long="15.67633581161499" lat="38.13805961608887" type="ppla" gazref="unlock:14131947" name="Reggio di Calabria" conf="0.9930989067">Calabria</enamex> and <enamex sw="w5720" long="16.2500000" lat="41.2500000" type="civila" gazref="geonames:3169778" name="Apulia" conf="1.206943213">Apulia</enamex>; yet we know not whether they were introduced along with English sheep, or at some other time.</s> <s id="s38">These things, without doubt, and many more that might be instanced, originate from causes which have not been of sufficient importance for the notice of general history; or they have crept on in a silent progression; or have been transported by casualties, the authentic story of which is either lost or obscured by time: yet some of them furnish powerful arguments for the existence of obsolete arrangements, and unrecorded intercourse.</s> <s id="s39">It is here that local attempts to supply the void in general history take place, and present resemblances, which may stimulate curiosity to investigate, if possible, their causes.</s></p>
<p><s id="s40">Iv.</s> <s id="s41">That languages radically the same, even in the latter ages of the world, should assume altered tones and idioms, far alienated from their original ones, does not seem wonderful, when one recollects the number of promiscuous tongues with which force and other contingencies have blended them; it seems to me rather more wonderful, that modern refinement, and the laboured improvements of grammarians, have not almost erazed every trace of affinity.</s> <s id="s42">A language, when once settled with classic precision, will of course leave out such a number of the current phrases, and words of particular districts, as are proportional to the difference between the dialects of those districts and of the men who compiled the standard tongue: some, besides, will be lost by forgetfulness, and others overlooked on account of their vulgarity.</s> <s id="s43">In process of time these excluded words and phrases grow more and more estranged, become at last a barbarism, and are forgotten.</s> <s id="s44">Yet it is not perhaps unworthy of a thinking mind to observe, how other tongues of the same stock still retain, in their purest state, many of those things which are exiled into the more barbarous and remote dialects of another; or in what manner expressions, though occasionally changed in termination,&amp; c.</s> <s id="s45">mingle familiarly with the current of one mode of speech, when they have lost all connection with each other.</s> <s id="s46">There are few dialects which have not something distinct and peculiar to themselves; either in single words, particular phrases, or the general structure of their sentences; and when such a dialect as one of these has no standard of its own, that is, before civilization and learning have given it uniformity, every one that writes will write the words he is accustomed to, and in the stile which use has taught him.</s> <s id="s47">Again: Where there is no great seminary to produce scholars, who may dignify and fix their native idiom by their writings; an idiom, formed on some more fashionable plans, and established by some eminent performances, will be sought; it will become the language of scholars, and learning in time must not deviate from it.</s> <s id="s48">Yet as every county in <enamex  sw="w8579" name="Large admin unit">England</enamex>, though the radicals of its language be common, and its speech in general conformable to that of the rest, uses many phrases notwithstanding which are peculiar to itself; we may naturally infer, from the variety of nations who have inhabited this island, that it was always so; and that the standard tongue, which is a sort of mixture of the whole, left out many words as needless, because supplied by other dialects, and rejected many more on account of their vulgarity.</s> <s id="s49">Therefore, if any particular place has, by its cultivation of letters, or by its authority, established the superiority of its own dialect; that dialect, as it advances in refinement, will gradually become fastidious, and reject or forget many of its own homely phrases which it had in common with others of the same stock, and assume those of languages which circumstances have rendered still more learned or fashionable.</s> <s id="s50">Few will hesitate in calling this an emendation; yet such emendation will make the distinction still more obvious, as it must of course leave out many of those expressions which it once used in common with its kindred dialects, and which rusticity and solitude have in the mean time secured from any material alteration: for from whatever cause languages originate, without books as a fixed point to which they may recur, they will always in general intercourse be vague and fluctuating.</s></p>
<p><s id="s51">V. That irregular, but mischievous kind of war, which is called Incursive, cannot well subsist but amongst those who reside in territories contiguous to the boundaries of two hostile or rival states.</s> <s id="s52">Its requisite is Expedition, and its object Plunder.</s> <s id="s53">The disturbance of wars, like the boiling of a caldron, hath a sort of scum.</s> <s id="s54">Troublesome tempers, incapable of rest, and fond of rapine through native avarice or inveterate habits; these tempers, when jealousy makes nations under the masque of peace ill at ease with each other, or when civil administration is held with a lax hand, or again when the governors of the outside provinces, from private interests or pique, connive at their practices, will too often receive a tacit encouragement.</s> <s id="s55">But add to these, even in better times, the advantages of night, secrecy, and by-ways; the obstacles to regular judicial inquiry, from difference of laws under different governments; the patronage and protection of their immediate lords, of relations and neighbours; together with the force of example handed down from father to son for many generations; and we need not wonder, if such a disease acquired no small degree of virulence.</s> <s id="s56">There may, however, be still more reasons assigned; for when such a people are uncertain to which government they belong, or are continually changing their masters, they are willing enough to think they belong to neither, may make incursions on both, or fight out their own quarrels amongst themselves, without imagining that they are accountable to any one.</s> <s id="s57">Besides, individuals of this cast are too apt, when their fortunes are desperate, to forget that they have any native country at all, and to consider every thing as lawful game; or even, from a custom so long nourished in the lap of barbarity, may never dream that such actions are criminal, and perhaps consider them as requisites of life.</s> <s id="s58">Moreover, when wrenched by force from one party, or surrendered with a grudge, their practices may be abetted by that party as the hopes of a war, and the means of recovery.</s> <s id="s59">There might, without doubt, were we more intimately acquainted with circumstances, be many more causes adduced to confirm the likeliness of a durable and extensive effect attached to such a life; but these which are already mentioned, and for which there is undoubted authority with respect to their application in the present purpose, are sufficient to persuade any one that they were enough to produce certain effects, which would add new horror and cruelty to themselves; namely, old wrongs to avenge, and hereditary antipathies to gratify.</s> <s id="s60">But it ought not to be forgot, that such men, by their continual acquaintance with danger, and their knowledge of the country; by their hardiness, subtlety, and swiftness, would be excellent attendants on more regular armies; they would be well qualified for partisans, foragers and spies; and from thence might receive additional encouragement; nay, we know that the bulk of many armies has consisted of them: they will be, without doubt, extremely fierce and cruel; for with war a certain degree of barbarity will creep into mankind; but habitual war, and incessant violence must ensavage them strangely: History uniformly ascribes principles like these to a wild people, and generally finds them wild in a situation like this of which we are speaking.</s></p>
<p><s id="s61">Vi.</s> <s id="s62">When a country is exposed to continual invasions from a neighbouring enemy, its means of defence will be proportionally numerous.</s> <s id="s63">A regular government generally establishes a chain of forts, or of military stations, for its defence; or, as the Chinese have done, and as the Romans did in more places than one, builds a barrier still more continuous to exclude the invaders.</s> <s id="s64">But in the half - anarchy of the feudal system, every petty lord had his castle to defend his domain and his own hoard, independent of those that were maintained at the public charge.</s> <s id="s65">One mode had in view the security of a whole province; the other, whilst it weakened the first, more immediately regarded the property of individuals.</s> <s id="s66">One expects, in the first case, numerous encampments, fortresses, and military stations; in the latter, that when the defence of the inhabitants is left in a great measure to themselves, every house will be as strong as the owner can afford to make it, or will be built on an eminence for the sake of a good look-out; but, if neither of these can be accomplished, will be in the vicinity of some strong place, to which its inhabitants may withdraw for shelter.</s> <s id="s67">Again: When a detached kingdom retains its independence long after those contiguous to it; its manners and religious rites, when those of the others are abolished, or changed by the intrusion of strangers, we expect it should retain proportionally fresher marks of its former condition.</s> <s id="s68">From any one of these considerations we look for many vestiges of elder times, but when all are combined in a particular district, it is natural to infer that such a district will contain many relics of antiquity.</s></p>
<p><s id="s69">Vii.</s> <s id="s70">The painter's researches for views, which by a sort of irregular symmetry may affect the imagination strongly, or may please the eye by richness of tints or variety of shades, are generally gratified where the ruder boldness of mountains is contrasted with the rich foliage of trees, or with sheets or streams of water: or where clouds and vapours intersperse varieties of aerial scenery, that change as it were by magic, impressing on the objects within their effect a hue and cast of appearance that scarce seems earthly.</s> <s id="s71">He chuses his stations where these may not only meet at once, but in such an arrangement as may strike the mind powerfully, and leave their impression and image upon the memory.</s> <s id="s72">Where painting goes, there generally goes poetry; their walks are the same; their beloved scenes are similar, and have always been so from the Grecian tempe, to the green glens of <enamex  sw="w15886" name="Large admin unit">Britain</enamex>.</s></p>
<p><s id="s73">Viii.</s> <s id="s74">Wherever there are mountains, there are certain changes of weather, quite dissimilar to those which are experienced in leveller places; nay, there are diversities of climate in places equally mountainous, arising from the different directions of their hills, winds may be diverted from their original course, and part of them so diverted as to cross and interrupt each other; or they may be precipitated from the summits; or, again, in some cases generated by a mere agglomeration of clouds or mists.</s> <s id="s75">Now, it is well known what a material effect winds have upon the weather, or rather how intimately they are connected with it: and wherever the observers of the seasons find their prognostics changed from those of the low lands, where they are most commonly made,( because there they can be made with more certainty, and earlier with respect to their consequences,) there must be an amazing tract for natural philosophy to walk in, and examine the causes: yet this it may do with more ease in a hilly country, than a level one; because amongst hills the effects more immediately follow the cause, and both may be observed almost at once.</s> <s id="s76">In either case, it may perhaps divert a classic reader to compare the modern rustic method of foretelling weather, with that of Hesiod and <enamex  sw="w17179" name="Not a placename">Virgil</enamex>.</s></p>
<p><s id="s77">It will easily be seen, that the preceding paragraphs have no regular plan in themselves, nor dependence upon each other: they are indeed only so many distinct themes on which I mean to comment, without observing any order, or having any other reference but what regards the plans.</s> <s id="s78">However, as they are very diffuse in their nature, it may not be amiss to subjoin a general application of each, and shew in what manner they concern the business which I have undertaken.</s></p>
<p><s id="s79">I. With respect to the first, I cannot begin this subject better than with an observation of sir Walter Raleigh's.</s> <s id="s80">speaking of that passage in Herodotus, wherein he ascribes the great wars between the Persians and Greeks to the vanity of Atossa the Persian Queen, who being desirous of having some Grecian bondwoman, teized her husband till he began that terrible contest; sir Walter says," This I may boldly affirm,( having," I think, in every estate some sufficient witness,) that matters of much consequence," founded, in all seeming, upon substantial reasons, have issued indeed from" such petty trifles, as no historian would either think upon, or could well search out."</s> <s id="s81">To this sentiment I so entirely accede, as to believe, that more than half of the great affairs of this world might, had we but the proper clue, be traced to some insignificancy or other as their origin: for if we say that trifles affect the minds of men in the most eminent stations, we may instance the proffer of assistance made by the Grand signior to Henry Iv.</s> <s id="s82">of <enamex  sw="w18706" name="Large admin unit">France</enamex>, merely because the former hated the word League. What dreadful havock was occasioned in <enamex  sw="w18803" name="Large admin unit">England</enamex> by a casual amour, and subsequent marriage of Edward Iv.! Affairs purely domestic made Henry Viii.</s> <s id="s83">shake off the Pope's supremacy; and a ludicrous present of a few tennis-balls is said not a little to have exasperated that great contest for empire between the kings of <enamex  sw="w19080" name="Large admin unit">France</enamex> and <enamex  sw="w19091" name="Large admin unit">England</enamex>.</s> <s id="s84">The finest library in the world owed its destruction to the Alexandrine war, which took its rise from an amorous interview between <enamex  sw="w19231" name="Not a placename">Caesar</enamex> and <enamex sw="w19242" long="-105.701393" lat="39.7858206" type="other" gazref="unlock:8157394" name="Cleopatra Mine" conf="0.7928924831">Cleopatra</enamex>; and the pitiful logic of an Arabian zealot destroyed another.</s> <s id="s85">But instances of such events are numberless, nor are those fewer the execution of which depend upon multitudes.</s> <s id="s86">Thus the over-forwardness and wantonness of a tax-gatherer caused that mighty insurrection of the Kentish Commons which disturbed the reign of Richard Ii.; and the steadiness of a poor, old, insignificant priest, first gave consistency to the Reformation in scotland.</s> <s id="s87">The confinement of a few gladiators gave being to troubles which challenged the strength of the Roman Legions; and these outrages in <enamex sw="w19828" long="-73.95583329999999" lat="40.6541667" type="other" gazref="unlock:8629969" name="Judea Center" conf="1">Judea</enamex>, which did not terminate but in the almost entire extinction of the Jewish name, are generally referred to the dismission of some workmen from the building of the last Temple.</s> <s id="s88">I forbear further instances; and shall only ask, To what more important cause can we ascribe those religious quarrels with which almost the whole world has at times been disturbed?</s> <s id="s89">Whoever considers the vanity, or superstition, or other weaknesses incident to the most eminent men, will not wonder at such things as strange, any more than that the falling of an apple should suggest to the comprehensive soul of <enamex sw="w20422" long="-1.574128458491406" lat="54.61478863402004" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:11230848" name="Newton Aycliffe" conf="1.6">Newton</enamex>, the idea of that great principle which regulates all nature.</s> <s id="s90">Though these same weaknesses in the minds of the multitude may perhaps operate with a greater force, there generally are found some more remote, or perhaps collateral incidents, necessary to give them effect; of which we might bring illustrations: but I am afraid that this digression is already too long; I only meant it as an argument of my more immediate subject, to which I therefore return.</s></p>
<p><s id="s91">The disturbances on the borders of <enamex  sw="w20922" name="Large admin unit">England</enamex> and scotland have frequently been the plea, and sometimes the cause of most serious affairs; yet these disturbances,( such was the temper of the people,) were begun, and continually fostered by the most unaccountable trifles.</s> <s id="s92">If they met at a fair, or a merry-making, some or other of them got engaged in a quarrel; each party had numerous favourers and abettors, and thus the contest became general: it was carried home by every individual, and they only came back to revenge it.</s> <s id="s93">Thus mutual insults and injuries made mutual complaints and justifications necessary; these delayed the cure, and this delay was not a little increased by the strange nature of the laws which prevailed in those districts: the mischief, in consequence, received continual increase, till it became of a size for general history.</s> <s id="s94">In the year 1369, a fair was held at <enamex sw="w21775" long="-2.499436698591758" lat="55.55816481329543" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:11273944" name="Roxburgh Mains" conf="1.487541359">Roxburgh</enamex> during a peace between the two nations: at this fair a quarrel arose amongst the Borderers, as was generally the case, and a scotsman, servant to the Earl of March, was killed.</s> <s id="s95">Amongst the customs, and even laws of these strange people, a certain atonement for blood was one; and this atonement not being made on the present occasion, his master took up the quarrel, in which he was assisted by the Gordon and others.</s> <s id="s96">These began to ravage the opposite marches in a terrible manner, and of course called forth the Wardens of those marches, sir John silburn, and the <enamex sw="w22350" long="-1.27876812904297" lat="54.67358652505902" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:26203" name="Dalton Piercy" conf="1.571648901">Piercy</enamex>, to repel the invasion, and to take vengeance by similar means.</s> <s id="s97">Thus the confines at large of both kingdoms, and the counties adjoining, became in a great measure a scene of desolation;

yet the humor was such, as very seldom to use any such friendly application.</s> <s id="s103">Hence, the hunters were generally driven home again, and punished, according to the spirit of the times, by a few robberies, slaughters, and burnings within their own boundaries.</s> <s id="s104">Thus was a war begun, which spread, sometimes more, and sometimes less, into the neighbouring kingdoms;

<p><s id="s217">I shall, however, begin with a law mentioned by Cambden.</s> <s id="s218">No one but a scotsman could be admitted as an evidence against a scotsman, nor any one but an Englishman against an Englishman.</s> <s id="s219">This was surely a very fortunate law for thieves, and more especially for those of the debateable ground; who, from their situation, could be of either nation, or of neither, as they pleased.</s> <s id="s220">This law, however, could only extend to particular matters; since there is another in Nicholson's collection, expressly declaring, that no inhabitant of either kingdom, could, by means of witnesses, prove his property in any thing possessed by an inhabitant of the other; for such proof could only be made by the body of a man, that is by combat; and so numerous were the causes of litigation, that these combats ensued continually.</s> <s id="s221">The Marches, moreover, were the places where all such trials, whether for murder or theft, were to take place between the inhabitants of the two kingdoms; and no man accused of these, or any other crime that ought to be tried by single combat, was bound to answer for them elsewhere.</s> <s id="s222">For this reason, there were particular places fixed upon and set apart for that purpose; and to those places might all men, betwixt Tolness in <enamex  sw="w53355" name="Large admin unit">England</enamex> and <enamex sw="w53367" long="-3.437163211993359" lat="58.40910812858041" type="civil" gazref="unlock:13471982" name="Landward Caithness Ward" conf="1.136797698">Caithness</enamex> in scotland, excepting the two Kings and certain Bishops, be summoned conformable to custom, and required to decide their quarrels by combat.</s> <s id="s223">I believe that the Borderers had the good effects of this law almost entirely to themselves, nor do I remember to have heard or read of more than two instances in which strangers availed themselves of it.</s> <s id="s224">Between the interior parts of the two kingdoms there was not much commerce of any kind; but the commerce of injuries in particular could not extend far, especially in times of peace, for which only laws could be made; partly, because the force employed in the petty infractions of quiet was not capable of a wide direction, and partly from the very nature of the incursions themselves.</s> <s id="s225">There was a law also which regarded the flight of a vassal into either kingdom, whereby, if demanded upon oath within six weeks, he might be recovered by his lord, whether he had fled with or without his goods; but if the demand was made later than that time, the recovery of him was attended with greater difficulty.</s> <s id="s226">Debts were to be recovered by an oath taken by the creditor in person upon the Marches, nor were any allowed to make claims of this kind by proxies except the Kings and Bishops before mentioned.</s> <s id="s227">The laws which respect these transactions are pretty similar to those which took place in other parts; only, if a debtor of low rank could get other six persons to join with him in swearing that he owed no such debt, he might be acquitted of it.</s> <s id="s228">But in matters touching life and limb, and indeed in every claim, a personal attendance to prosecute the quarrel or cause by oath was required of every one but those before excepted; and without this, unless a deputation was made by the consent of both parties, a man's plea was lost for ever.</s> <s id="s229">Though the foregoing law did not contain much extraordinary matter, yet its want of singularity is fully compensated by one which immediately follows: for it is there declared, that in every plea between a plaintiff and defendant that affected life and limb, that is, which was to be decided by combat, if the defendant happened to die within the fifteen days preceding the day of trial, his body should be carried to the Marches at the time, and to the place appointed between the two parties, because no man can be assoigned by death.</s> <s id="s230">Again, When the appellant delayed his appearance beyond the appointed day, the defendant ought to pass to the Marches, and obtain an attestation from three Barons that he had regularly made his appearance on the day prefixed; and this being signed by them, he was totally exempted from being liable to any challenge upon that score for the future.</s> <s id="s231">He had also a right, if any, or all of those Barons to whom he made application should refuse to give such a testimony, to oblige even them to decide the matter by combat; and the same privilege extended also to the appellant.</s> <s id="s232">stolen goods were, like debts, demanded upon oath, and might be recovered, unless the person in whose possession they were found chose to deny it; the matter was then referred to the usual mode of decision.</s> <s id="s233">With respect to the issue, or, to speak more in the language of the times, conviction of these trials by combat, it is worthy of notice, that whether a person was found guilty, by this means, of theft, or robbery, or murder, his atonement was made by a forfeiture of goods, and he was obliged to find sureties for the completion of this atonement; in consequence of which, there were particular laws respecting the convict, his sureties, and the pursuer.</s> <s id="s234">An asylum was, amongst the other circumstances of these laws, allowed to any malefactor who fled from one kingdom to the other: and when he passed from one district or province of the kingdom, in which he had taken refuge, he was entitled to protection upon an application to the sheriff of that district or province into which he entered: or if he could not find the sheriff, he might still obtain peace and protection, by ringing the bells of the first church at which he arrived within such precincts: but on the contrary, if he could be seized by those from whom he had escaped before he performed what was by them called" obtaining peace," in this manner, he might be carried back without opposition.</s> <s id="s235">Yet when a quarrel arrived at those circumstances, in which it could only be decided by combat; that is, when one person denied the claim of another, it might still be evaded within the fifteen days, which were generally allowed by ancient custom, as preparatory to such decision: for it was provided, that if the person accused should bring the animal, on account of which the litigation had risen, to the Marches on the day appointed for the combat, and there inform the opposite party that he believed that the property in question belonged to that party, he was exempted from the necessity of a combat; but was obliged to drive the animal into the Tweed or <enamex sw="w58304" long="-3.30009716472156" lat="54.3940525814659" type="water" gazref="unlock:8771979" name="River Esk" conf="2.4">Esk</enamex>; and if it was drowned before it reached the mid-stream, he was still answerable for it.</s> <s id="s236">We know not how they managed this business when the matter of dispute was such as could neither wade nor swim across, for we find no institution regarding the restoration on inanimate property.</s></p>
<p><s id="s237">It is needless to make any further reflection upon these laws, than what every one will make upon perusing them in these days of regularity and peace, viz.</s> <s id="s238">What such mortals must they have been, amongst whom such customs had prevailed from immemorial times, and for whom such laws were fabricated! However, from what it already said on this subject, I think any person may form some idea of the men who formerly inhabited the districts comprehended in these plans, and the parts contiguous.</s> <s id="s239">To be more copious would, perhaps, be superfluous, as any reader of common attention may find abundant examples of their temper and manner of life in the history of the dissensions and wars between the English and scots.</s> <s id="s240">I only beg leave to mention here, that the lands were held by a sort of military service peculiar to their situation; that when the beacons were fired, every man was to become a soldier; and that the hornage, sergeant's - oats, and a vast number of other dues, rents, and perquisites, of an almost singular kind, are to this hour indubitable proofs of the unhappy condition of these counties in former times.</s> <s id="s241">I think also, that I have said enough towards proving my original propositions concerning the leading characteristics which marked the people of the Northern parts of <enamex  sw="w59877" name="Large admin unit">England</enamex>, and towards demonstrating the effects of habitual infelicity, and a life never void of fear.</s> <s id="s242">I shall therefore conclude this subject with two or three quotations from Cambden, which serve as corollaries to the preceding proposition, and which, being writ at a time when the spirit, of moss-trooping was in full vigour, and by men who had seen its effects themselves, not only carry intrinsic credit along with them, but fully elucidate what I have been advancing.</s></p>
<p><s id="s243">In one place, Cambden says," That the inhabitants on both sides, as Borderers in all" other parts, are a military kind of men; nimble, wily, always in readiness for any" service, and, by reason of their often skirmishes passing, well experienced."</s></p>
<p><s id="s244">In another place is a passage which confirms my original supposition, that very little alteration of circumstances, and consequently of those manners which are influences by them, had taken place in the Borders for many ages.</s> <s id="s245">For we are there told, that" in the time of the Romans, their soldiers,( who were principally levied in <enamex  sw="w60931" name="Large admin unit">Britain</enamex>,) were" stationed in the frontier castles and cities of the Northern Provinces; and when there" was any fear of plunder or waste from the neighbouring nations, had field-stations in" the barbarian ground for the defence of the Province; others made outrodes into" the enemy's Marches, to discover their motions, and if good occasion offered, to encounter" with them before they came to their limits."</s></p>
<p><s id="s246">He also presents us with an account which Lesley Bishop of Ross gives of the Borderers:" They go forth in the night by troops out of their own borders, through desart" by-ways, and many winding cranks.</s> <s id="s247">All the day-time they refresh their horses," and recreate their own strength, in lurking-places appointed before-hand, until they" be come thither at last in the dark night where they would be; when they have laid" hold of a booty, back again they return home likewise by night, through blind ways" only, and fetching many a compass about: the more skilful any leader or guide" is to pass through those wild desarts, crooked turnings, and steep downfalls, in" the thickest mists, and deepest darkness, he is held in the greater reputation, as one" of an excelling wit: and so crafty and wily these are, that seldom or never they forgo" their booty, and suffer it to be taken out of their hands; unless it happen otherwhiles," that they be caught by their adversaries following continually after, and tracing" them by their footing, according as quick-scented sluth-hounds do lead them; but" say they be taken, so fair spoken are they and eloquent, so many sugared words they" have at will, sweetly to plead for them, that they are able to move the judges and" adversaries both, be they ever so austere and severe, if not to mercy, yet to admiration," and some commiseration withal."</s></p>
<p><s id="s248">speaking of the Ottaduni, Cambden says,' That which aeneas sylvius, afterwards' Pope Pius Ii.</s> <s id="s249">hath, when a private person, and ambassador to scotland, under the' name of John Gebelli, reported of the Borderers, I think good to relate, considering' that as yet they have not at all degenerated.'</s> <s id="s250">From this account, that I may avoid transcribing the whole, it appears, that in the year 1448, wherein he performed this embassy, that the principal subsistence of the Borderers was on hens, geese, and various sorts of gruels, and pottage, but were utterly unacquainted with white bread or wine.</s> <s id="s251">This circumstance proves their commerce must have been very little, or none at all, and their agriculture in a very poor condition.</s> <s id="s252">Indeed, who would till the ground, when it was so uncertain who should reap, or perhaps burn the crop?</s> <s id="s253">We do not find that they wanted hospitality, though it was probably like that of the <enamex sw="w63659" long="-82.3783" lat="28.0193" type="other" gazref="unlock:10816809" name="Arabian Acres" conf="0.9919764374">Arabian</enamex>, who would perhaps feast you in his house to-day, and rob you in the desart to-morrow.</s> <s id="s254">When aeneas arrived at a large village, the name of which he does not mention, the inhabitants of it, men, women, and children, came running about him, to gape and stare at him as at a strange sight, or the appearance of a" blackamore, or a man of <enamex  sw="w64003" name="Large admin unit">India</enamex>."</s> <s id="s255">Having been informed of the scarcity prevailing in those districts, he had received at a certain Abbey some loaves of white bread, and a rundlet of red wine, which to these attendants of his, for they had followed him to the house where he supped, inquiring of their priest whether he was a christian or not, were matters of greater astonishment than himself, having never till that time seen any thing of the kind:" There approached the table," says he, great-bellied women, and their husbands, who handling the bread, and smelling" the wine, craved some part thereof; and there was no remedy, but to divide and" give it all away amongst them."</s> <s id="s256">However, two hours within night they all( i.e. the males,) left aeneas to himself, and repaired with all possible speed, for fear of the scots, to a strong place at a good distance, leaving the women behind, and refusing to accept of aeneas's company; for it seems the scots used at low water to pass over the river, and fall to boot-haling. With respect to their ravenous method of begging mentioned above, I cannot help comparing it to that of the Haiduks, who lead a savage and miserable life amongst the mountains of <enamex sw="w65183" long="-76.90248" lat="40.65425" type="other" gazref="unlock:7926594" name="Dalmatia" conf="0.7084767128">Dalmatia</enamex>, and are sometimes compelled by hunger to come down amongst the Morlacchi of the lower country, with manners similar to those of our Borderers: whilst their resorting to places of defence, and leaving their own habitations in times of danger, bears a strong resemblance to the practice of the back-settlers in <enamex  sw="w65502" name="Large admin unit">America</enamex>, who being, like these, rendered half - savages by situation, and exposed to unforeseen inroads, are necessitated to similar resources, when they are threatened with an Indian war; only there is this distinction, the English savages in <enamex  sw="w65744" name="Large admin unit">America</enamex> shelter their wives along with themselves, but the English savages on the borders of scotland refused any such allowance to theirs;" being," as aeneas tells us," thoroughly perswaded that the enemies will do them no hurt, as who reckon whoredom" no hurt or evil at all."</s> <s id="s257">To have done with this account given by aeneas, it appears, particularly from the remaining part of it, that they spent their days in anxiety, and their nights without rest: that, ingrossed with more immediate cares, they had no ideas of any kind of improvement or elegance: that their furniture, employment, accommodations, and dress, bore incontestible marks of the first and rudest stages of society; and that the condition of their women, even making allowance for the effects of habit, must have been particularly unhappy; since, independent of the danger to which they were exposed, and of the continual alarms in which they lived, on account of their situation, they were treated so grossly, and neglected so shamefully by the men, as to be refused the same shelter and defence with themselves; experiencing in this, that usage which, as it is the constant companion, is held by all writers to be a sure sign of the compleatest state of barbarism.</s> <s id="s258">What a change has a space of time less than two centuries produced!</s></p>

There is also another village in which those rates were never yet collected at all, and where the custom of providing for their poor, which subsisted long before the laws respecting that subject, is still continued; and its particulars, which are curious enough, are known and observed with the greatest exactness, both by the paupers and the other inhabitants.</s></p>

<p><s id="s321">Waving a great number of things relative to this subject, because there may be found in every place customs sufficient to fill a volume, I shall just mention one or two which are generally known, though their origin is not much attended to, nor perhaps can be ever known with certainty: That of blessing a person who sneezes would almost seem, from that passage in Homer where Penelope addresses <enamex  sw="w88662" name="Not a placename">Telemachus</enamex> upon such an occasion, to be of Graecian origin; though tradition says that it arose during a plague which commonly began with sneezing, and was a mode of wishing that this might not be a forerunner of the malady.</s> <s id="s322">The virtue of uneven numbers plainly sprung up in the medical world; and indeed the phrases that still remain in so many countries respecting them, however rude and vulgar, refer obviously to the empiric superstition from whence they originated.</s> <s id="s323">Religion has given birth to far more trifles, which are still alive, than any thing else, though they are at this day matters of sport; nor will an one who considers the genius of former times be hard to perswade, that even st Agnes's Fast, the efficacy of bride-cake on dreams, the ceremony of tossing a stocking in the bed-chamber of a newly-married couple, and twenty other modes of prognostication belonging to the young, and still more belonging to the aged, were in former times of some importance, especially when he is told that there are some silly minds that repose a confidence in them yet: and indeed if we make a reference to times and prejudices, why may not the meeting of the flames of two nuts thrown into the fire, each of which is supposed to represent a person, as fairly betoken the union of those persons, as the parting of the flame that arose from the funeral pyre of Eteocles and Polynices betokened the hatred of those brothers?</s> <s id="s324">The method of divination amongst the ancient Germans, as we find it in Tacitus, was by no means more complex, and not a little resembled this, as well in the few circumstances belonging to each, as in their common simplicity.</s></p>

<p><s id="s333">When I said elsewhere that solitude preserved language from change, I might have added Customs also: Amongst the many living examples of this, I need instance none but that of the celebration of Christmas.</s> <s id="s334">In proportion as you advance into the more lonely and mountainous districts, so much the more is the ancient fashion of that festival perfect; the numbers of pies, and of the rural attendants on conviviality increased; the waits with their fiddles pass from village to village; and the winter merry-nights( as they are called,) supply the want of the wakes, which are common( at other seasons indeed,) in the more southern counties.</s></p>

<p><s id="s376">so far have I thought it necessary to take notice of the connection of the general dialect of these parts with other tongues, either dead or living; further variations, which may have happened to all dialects alike, have no connection with the present subject.</s> <s id="s377">It would indeed be a curious employment for history to take notice of the times when, and the reasons why some terms have ceased in one mode of speech whilst they remained in another: but they were beneath its notice; besides, they probably ceased in a gradual manner; and it generally takes notice of things which have either suddenly started into notice, or have been suddenly destroyed.</s> <s id="s378">I speak with respect to matters of this nature, for great things will always demand attention.</s></p>
<p><s id="s379">There is another thing to which, though belonging to language in general, I beg leave to advert: Words frequently, in their various composition, and kindred references, begin at last to forget their original import; and that the more rapidly as any language is the more unsettled; for there is a sort of poetry belonging to the human mind which is very apt in discourse to substitute resembling things for one another; or where the cause and its effect are proportional, to use them indiscriminately: or again, in a still more distant analogy, to speak in higher metaphors; and, by dint of habit and continual acceptation, to forget that the phrases which we use are merely emblematic; nor find it an easy matter, on account of a familiarity with them, as the names of things of which they are really but the type, to resolve them into their original principles.</s> <s id="s380">subtile men have taken advantage of this prepossession, and have constructed curious theories upon it.</s> <s id="s381">That my meaning may be more clearly understood, I shall subjoin an example or two.</s> <s id="s382">We speak familiarly of a mellow-sound, and a mellow-apple; that is of two things,( the sound and the apple,) exceedingly different; yet because the effect which they produce on the senses is somehow or other similar, we couple them with the same epithet; and having given a name to the sensation excited by the apple, we first apply it to the apple itself, and then to the sound which excited a somewhat-similar sensation; yet still we speak metaphorically, giving the names of our own feelings to the things which excited them: likewise, when the cause corresponds with its effect, we use them indiscriminately for each other, whether the Bishop of Cloyne will give us leave or not: thus, to contain impression upon the senses from external objects, we give the name of Weight and Heaviness, for the feeling or effect is proportional to the cause or body that presses.</s> <s id="s383">Again: When a similar sensation is excited by disease, we give it the name of Weight, though there is no pressing body in the case; thence, carrying it further still to that feeling of mind which untoward circumstances produce, we give name of Heaviness and sadness when no disease is present, from its resembling the sensations excited by disease; speaking still in metaphors, though unconscious of it from habit, and always thinking that we express the thing itself, whilst we only express its corresponding idea on our own minds.</s> <s id="s384">I have inserted these general observations, because they are particularly applicable to the dialects of which I am speaking; for in them such a mode of speech is remarkably frequent, and indeed constitutes the principal part of discourse.</s> <s id="s385">Thus,( that I may select one or two of the numberless instances that might be produced,) a calm day is said to be lown, and a cool-designing man has the same epithet bestowed on him: slape is slippery, and therefore a person in whom one can repose no confidence is a slape hand: that which is smooth and soft is called snod, and hence a man of an easy calm deportment is a snod fellow. I forbear going further, as it would lead me beyond my limits; and I shall only observe, that such phrases, which abound in every language, are like appeals from one sense to another for the truth of the resemblance which is perceived.</s></p>
<p><s id="s386">Words also, by means of such metaphorical, and I think I may call it arbitrary transpositions, sometimes entirely lose their original one.</s> <s id="s387">The of the Greeks originally signified only a being of more than human intelligence; however, in the times of the writers of the New Testament, it was only applied to malignant spirits in the sense in which it is at present received.</s> <s id="s388">Thus loom is at present only used for the weaver's machine; but it was formerly, as it is at present in scotland, and sometimes in the North of <enamex  sw="w105335" name="Large admin unit">England</enamex>, the name of any kind of instrument; as appears by the words Edge Loom, Work Loom, and in scotland by the general name of the Apparatus, for brewing,&amp; c.</s> <s id="s389">How signifies empty or hungry; but the how neet is an expression so very poetical, that it by no means can be reduced to its original signification, but by supposing it to be significant of the loneliness and solitude that characterize the waste of night.</s> <s id="s390">Byspelt is an epithet for a very bad person; that is, his name is wrong spelled( for so by-spelled means,) like that of the devil, who is commonly mentioned by a nick-name.</s></p>
<p><s id="s391">Compound metaphors are also very common here, but the resolution of them into their original and component parts is often so doubtful that there is a danger of the Etymologist being liable to such sarcasms as <enamex sw="w106136" long="-0.47656" lat="52.30403" type="other" gazref="unlock:13907423" name="Dean and Shelton" conf="0.8648232644">Dean</enamex> swift might bestow upon him.</s> <s id="s392">Let it be remembered, that the sentence in <enamex  sw="w106213" name="Not a placename">Milton</enamex>,</s></p>

<p><s id="s399">In considering the various subjects which naturally fall under these heads, I often view, with a degree of wonder, that mighty variation which has occasionally taken place in the application of one and the same word, or of its derivatives; a variation increasing in a sort of compound proportion of the popularity and antiquity of the word itself.</s> <s id="s400">This has been a thing which has puzzled etymologists more perhaps than any other; finding the same word applied in quite different senses, without being in the least able to account for the difference: for when the circumstances which first occasioned it, by presenting some similarity of ideas, have ceased, the word still remains, and gives birth to fresh ones, in a series which seems as if it arose from that poetical turn of which I have already made mention, and which is natural to mankind without their being conscious of it; beginning, forsooth, with things the affinity of which is pretty obvious, but in proportion as they grow numerous extends its plan, multiplies not only its objects, but along with them increases its want of adequate description in direct phrases; and consequently, by means of the similies and metaphors of different degrees, which become necessary to it, multiplies proportionally the modes of expression.</s> <s id="s401">' Tis thus that in a sort of inifinte permutation the native bent of the human mind produces the various terms of a language; and these terms, amongst an active people, do not cease to grow more numerous, till almost every thing has got a name, and every mode of thinking with which they are acquainted a mode of expression, in some sort.</s> <s id="s402">After this, the growth of a language is but slow, or perhaps it is static; for, in general, as new things come forward, old ones are thrust out; and thus the language of the day may be prevented from acquiring any considerable increase.</s> <s id="s403">By these means, however, it seems that language in general has, from a few rude and half - articulated sounds, acquired its present copiousness, fastidiousness, and customs.</s> <s id="s404">such a theory as this,( if it be indeed only a theory,) is strongly backed by observation.</s> <s id="s405">Few wants, and few objects, have never been found to produce a copious mode of speech, and where many wants and many objects grew upon those few, what method could the human mind have of pointing them out, but by an analogy to those things which were familiar to them before?</s> <s id="s406">The derivatives, which we are still able to trace with a tolerable degree of certainty from a very remote stock, indicate, that such a comparing principle has had no small share in increasing words, and more particularly phrases: They give us also large room to suspect that there is a great number more of the same sort, the clue of which is lost; and that though conjecture, or perhaps something more substantial, may occasionally patch up the affinity of some, yet there are others which have lost sight of their original for ever.</s> <s id="s407">We have at least one satisfactory conclusion from the circumstances which were mentioned before, that, whatever it was which gave language birth,( and it was probably the imitation of sounds,) simile and metaphor have been its nurses.</s> <s id="s408">Derivation, indeed, and composition have lent their aid, but it was as subalterns, and they only expressed partial changes, affecting the meaning of their originals; whereas, besides these effects, the other from their natural tendency often gave expression even to new ideas.</s> <s id="s409">That the reader may have a more compleat notion of what I would inculcate by the foregoing observations, I shall refer him to the treatise which that learned oriental Dr <enamex sw="w111220" long="-105.5013855" lat="39.7933212" type="other" gazref="unlock:8164101" name="Gregory Hill" conf="0.8583746263">Gregory</enamex> sharp has writ upon the subject of the Origin of Language; he will there find,( what indeed the small number of the Hebrew roots and the very temper of the language must have made the Doctor feel forcibly,) that, even in far different languages, which were intermingled with a variety of others, a strange transposition of terms had occasionally obtained.</s> <s id="s410">He relates, that from the name of a town in <enamex  sw="w111628" name="Large admin unit">Italy</enamex> where a sort of little swords or daggers were first made, that those daggers took their name;

<p><s id="s505">several authors, who have mentioned the soil of these counties, have represented it as unfavourable to the growth of timber; which I believe very true with respect to the mosses, and some other places; yet every inhabitant knows, that the glebe in general, if left to itself, that is, if exempted from the plough and the scythe, nor trod by cattle, would soon be covered with trees, and that the country would become one large forest; and this shews that its natural disposition is not to become a naked woald, but a desart of wood.</s> <s id="s506">A desart of wood it has indeed been, though in many places as poor as that of almost any country, and as ill calculated for the purposes of agriculture; particularly in the mosses that are amongst, or perhaps upon the mountains: these however have their woods; the birch, the wild-ash, the wythe, as it is called, and some others, are disposed to grow even in the wildest situations: slow in their growth, it is true, and for the most part stunted; which may be attributed to their being grazed upon by sheep, and naked to the winds; for as those places which seem at present most unpromising with respect to this kind of vegetation, and where( particularly in peat-mosses on the tops of pretty high hills) no man can easily persuade himself that a stick of any kind would grow, are found yet filled with the roots, trunks, and branches of trees of very different sizes; it seems as if those places did but want their original encouragement to become forests again.</s> <s id="s507">It may indeed be alledged, in opposition to such a thought, that the soil itself has undergone a material change, that the fall of the woods and the stagnation of waters has given birth to that vegetation which constitutes peat-mosses, and that this vegetation in an accumulation of putrid vegetable matter.</s> <s id="s508">If this be the case, yet still such putrid matter is found to be that of the roots of that plant, which in these parts is called <enamex sw="w143311" long="-80.1053173" lat="37.1481912" type="other" gazref="unlock:7489476" name="Bent Mountain" conf="0.8353011585">Bent</enamex>, and not of timber, which is generally preserved entire;

they are also to be found in the more inaccessible parts of others, that are elsewhere naked.</s> <s id="s511">I do not indeed know of any positive evidence that can be produced, either on this side of the question or on the opposite one, neither does the discussion of it belong particularly to my subject;

nor are these times so very remote, but your informer will in general tell you the name of the man whose forefather, at the distance of three or four ages, he was; yet a place less likely for the growth of timber, or more devoid of it at present, will not easily be found in the North of <enamex  sw="w145540" name="Large admin unit">England</enamex>.</s> <s id="s513">Even this, however, does not militate against what I formerly advanced;
