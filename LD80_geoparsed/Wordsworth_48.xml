<p><s id="s103">The Mountains are composed of the stone by mineralogists termed schist, which, as you approach the plain country, gives places to limestone and free-stone; but schist being the substance of the mountains, the predominant colour of their rocky parts is bluish, or hoary gray-- the general tint of the lichens with which the bare stone is encrusted.</s> <s id="s104">With this blue or grey colour is frequently intermixed a red tinge, proceeding from the iron that interveins the stone, and impregnates the soil.</s> <s id="s105">The iron is the principle of decomposition in these rocks; and hence, when they become pulverized, the elementary particles crumbling down overspread in many places the steep and almost precipitous sides of the mountains with an intermixture of colours, like the compound hues of a dove's neck.</s> <s id="s106">When, in the heat of advancing summer, the fresh green tint of herbage has somewhat faded, it is again revived by the appearance of the fern profusely spread over the same ground; and, upon this plant, more than upon any thing else, do the changes which the seasons make in the colouring of the mountains depend.</s> <s id="s107">About the first week in October, the rich green, which prevailed through the whole summer, is usually passed away.</s> <s id="s108">The brilliant and various colours of the fern are then in harmony with the autumnal woods; bright yellow or lemon colour, at the base of the mountains, melting gradually, through orange, to a dark russet brown towards the summits, where the plant, being more exposed to the weather, is in a more advanced state of decay.</s> <s id="s109">Neither heath nor furze are generally found upon the sides of these mountains, though in some places they are richly adorned by them.</s> <s id="s110">We may add, that the mountains are of height sufficient to have the surface towards the summits softened by distance, and to imbibe the finest aerial hues.</s> <s id="s111">In common also with other mountains, their apparent forms and colours are perpetually changed by the clouds and vapours which float around them: the effect indeed of mist or haze, in a country of this character, is like that of magic.</s> <s id="s112">I have seen six or seven ridges rising above each other, all created in a moment by the vapours upon the side of a mountain, which, in its ordinary appearance, showed not a projecting point to furnish even a hint for such an operation.</s></p>

I may add, as a general remark, that, in lakes of great width, the shores cannot be distinctly seen at the same time, and therefore contribute little to mutual illustration and ornament; and, if the opposite shores are out of sight of each other, like those of the American and Asiatic lakes, then unfortunately the traveller is reminded of a nobler object; he has the blankness of a sea-prospect without the grandeur and accompanying sense of power.</s></p>

<p><s id="s392">The principle that ought to determine the position, apparent size, and architecture of a house, viz.</s> <s id="s393">that it should be so constructed, and( if large) so much of it hidden, as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature-- should also determine its colour.</s> <s id="s394">Sir Joshua Reynolds used to say," if you would fix upon the best colour for your house, turn up a stone, or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots, and see what the colour of the soil where your house is to stand, and let that be your choice."</s> <s id="s395">Of course, this precept, given in conversation, could not have been meant to be taken literally.</s> <s id="s396">For example, in Low <enamex sw="w91557" long="-3.205728845294711" lat="54.27695240936971" type="ppl" gazref="unlock:11089765" name="Broughton in Furness" conf="2.6">Furness</enamex>, where the soil, from its strong impregnation with iron, is universally of a deep red, if this rule were strictly followed, the house also must be of a glaring red; in other places it must be of a sullen black; which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance.</s> <s id="s397">The rule, however, as a general guide, is good; and, in agricultural districts, where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough, particularly if( the face of the country being undulating) they are held up to view, this rule, though not to be implicitly adhered to, should never be lost sight of;-- the colour of the house ought, if possible, to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil.</s> <s id="s398">The principle is, that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape: accordingly, in mountainous countries, with still more confidence may it be said," look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible, and they will furnish a safe direction."</s> <s id="s399">Nevertheless, it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape, and may be of such a tone of colour, that the rule may not admit, even here, of being implicitly followed.</s> <s id="s400">For instance, the chief defect in the colouring of the Country of the Lakes( which is most strongly felt in the summer season) is an over-prevalence of a bluish tint, which the green of the herbage, the fern, and the woods, does not sufficiently counteract.</s> <s id="s401">If a house, therefore, should stand where this defect prevails, I have no hesitation in saying, that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen.</s> <s id="s402">A tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which, in technical language of painters, are called warm: this, if happily selected, would not disturb but would animate the landscape.</s> <s id="s403">How often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages, in cases where the glare of the white-wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather-stains! No harshness is then seen; but one of these cottages, thus coloured, will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected, and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture.</s> <s id="s404">But where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge, the colour cannot be too closely be imitated; and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry, and by the mortar, which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil.</s> <s id="s405">The pure blue gravel, from the bed of the river, is, however, more suitable to the mason's purpose, who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough-cast, otherwise it cannot be kept dry; if this advice be taken, the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at.</s></p>
<p><s id="s406">The supposed necessity of rough-cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick, has tended greatly to injure English landscape, and the neighbourhood of these Lakes especially, by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings.</s> <s id="s407">That white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons.</s> <s id="s408">The mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given, not only to an individual house, but, where the practice is general, to the whole face of the country, produces moral associations so powerful, that, in many minds, they take place of all others.</s> <s id="s409">But what has already been said upon the subject of cottages, must have convinced men of feeling and imagination, that a human habitation of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections, and far more pleasing to the eye, by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside.</s> <s id="s410">I do not, however, mean to deny, that a small white building, embowered in trees, may, in some situations, be a delightful and animating object-- in no way injurious to the landscape; but this only, where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade, and in rare and solitary instances; especially if the country be itself rich, and pleasing, and abound with grand forms.</s> <s id="s411">On the sides of the bleak and desolate moors, we are indeed thankful for the site of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered, where, without these, perhaps everything would be cheerless: this is said, however, with hesitation, and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments.</s> <s id="s412">But I have certainly seen such buildings glittering at sunrise, and in wandering lights, with no common pleasure.</s> <s id="s413">The continental traveller also will remember, that the convents hanging from the rocks of the <enamex sw="w96218" long="-2.61457645161183" lat="51.54290796029755" type="water" gazref="unlock:8779383" name="Bailey'S Mead Rhine" conf="1.218240138">Rhine</enamex>, the <enamex sw="w96229" long="5.41750431060791" lat="45.31649780273438" type="rgn" gazref="unlock:14129901" name="Rhône-Alpes" conf="0.7483263802">Rhone</enamex>, the <enamex sw="w96240" long="8.33460521697998" lat="48.01148223876953" type="water" gazref="unlock:14137687" name="Donau (Danube)" conf="0.8116984287">Danube</enamex>, or among the Appenines or the mountains of <enamex  sw="w96291" name="Large admin unit">Spain</enamex>, are not looked at with less complacency when, as is often the case, they happen to be of a brilliant white.</s> <s id="s414">But this is perhaps owing, in no small degree, to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life, and to the general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance, in those countries.</s></p>

<p><s id="s439">Having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants, provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house, we may add, that a transition should be contrived without abruptness, from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs, which ought to be of the kinds scattered by Nature through the woods-- holly, broom, wild-rose, elder, dogberry, white and black thorn,&amp; c.</s> <s id="s440">either these only, or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their uniting in form, and harmonising in colour with them, especially with respect to colour, when the tints are most diversified, as in autumn and spring.</s> <s id="s441">The various sorts of fruit-and-blossom-bearing trees usually found in orchards, to which may be added those of the woods,-- namely, the wilding, black cherry tree, and wild cluster-cherry( here called heck-berry) may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees; which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country.</s> <s id="s442">Of the birch, one of the most beautiful of the native trees, it may be noticed, that, in dry and rocky situations, it outstrips even the larch, which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth.</s> <s id="s443">Sycamore, and the Scotch fir( which, when it has room to spread out it arms, is a noble tree) may be placed with advantage near the house; for, from their massiveness, they unite well with buildings, and in some situations with rocks also; having, in their forms and apparent substances, the effect of something intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone, and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees.</s> <s id="s444">If these general rules be just, what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents, with their own wild wood in sight-- where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue jumbled together-- colour at war with colour, and form with form-- among the most peaceful subjects of Nature's kingdom every where in discord, distraction, and bewilderment! But this deformity, bad as it is, is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are over-running the hill-sides.</s> <s id="s445">To justify our condemnation of these, let us again recur to Nature.</s> <s id="s446">The process, by which she forms woods and forests, is as follows.</s> <s id="s447">Seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds, brought by waters, and dropped by birds.</s> <s id="s448">They perish, or produce, according to the soil and situation upon which they fall are situated to them; and under the same dependence, the seedling or sucker, if not cropped by animals, thrives, and the tree grows, sometimes single, taking its own shape without constraint, but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours.</s> <s id="s449">From low and sheltered places, vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed; and the young plants are protected, and to a certain degree fashioned, by those that have preceded them.</s> <s id="s450">The continous mass of foliage which would be thus produced, is broken by rocks, or by glades or open places, where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of the wood.</s> <s id="s451">As vegetation ascends, the wind begins also to bear their part in the moulding the forms of the trees; but, thus mutually protected, trees, though not of the hardiest kind, are enabled to climb high up the mountains.</s> <s id="s452">Gradually, however, by the quality of the ground, and by increasing exposure, a stop is put to their ascent; the hardy trees only are left; those also, by little and little, give way,-- and a wild and irregular boundary is established, graceful in its outline, and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed.</s></p>
<p><s id="s453">Contrast the liberty that encourages, and the law that limits, this joint work of nature and time, with the disheartening necessities, restrictions, and disadvantages, under which the artificial planter must proceed, even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task.</s> <s id="s454">In the first place his trees, however well chosen and adapted to their several situations, must generally all start at the same time; and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connectipn of parts, that sympathy and organization, if I may so express myself, which pervades the whole of a natural wood, and appears to the eye in its single trees, its masses of foliage, and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain; or when spread over a valley, they are looked down upon from an eminence.</s> <s id="s455">It is then impossible, under any circumstances, for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature.</s> <s id="s456">But a moment's thought will show that, if ten thousand of this spiky tree, the larch, are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill, they can grow up into nothing but deformity; that, while they are suffered to stand, we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood.</s></p>
<p><s id="s457">It must be acknowledged that the larch, till it has outgrown the size of a shrub, shows, when looked at singly, some elegance in form and appearance, especially in spring, decorated, as it then is, by the pink tassels of its blossoms; but, as a tree, it is less than any other pleasing; its branches( for boughs it has none) have no variety in the youth of the tree, and little dignity even when it attains its full growth; leaves it cannot be said to have, consequently neither affords the shade or shelter.</s> <s id="s458">In spring the large becomes green long before the native trees; and its green long before the native trees; and its green is so peculiar and vivid that, finding nothing to harmonize with it, wherever it comes forth, a disagreeable speck is produced.</s> <s id="s459">In summer, when all other trees are in their pride, it is of a dingy lifeless hue; in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow, and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous tree of the forest, for they seem only to sleep, but the larch appears absolutely dead.</s> <s id="s460">If an attempt be made to mingle thickets, or a certain proportion of other forest-trees, with the larch, its horizontal branches intolerably cut them down as a scythe, or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it.</s> <s id="s461">The terminating spike, renders it impossible, that the several trees, where planted in numbers, should ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood.</s> <s id="s462">Add thousands to tens of thousands, and the appearance is still the same-- a collection of separate individual trees, obstinately presenting themselves as such; and which, from whatever point they are looked at, if but seen, may be counted upon fingers.</s> <s id="s463">Sunshine, or shadow, has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood; and the trees not carrying up their their heads, the wind raises among them no magical undulations.</s> <s id="s464">It is indeed true, that, in countries where the larch is a native, and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley, and from hill to hill, a sublime image may be produced such a forest, in the same manner as by one composec of any other single tree, to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned.</s> <s id="s465">For sublimity will never be wanting, where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in, and alternates with, that of intense unity; and to the ready perception of this effect, similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute.</s> <s id="s466">But this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest; no artificial plantation can give it.</s></p>
<p><s id="s467">The forgoing observations will, I hope,( as nothing has been condemned or recommended without a substantial reason) have some influence upon those who plant for ornament merely.</s> <s id="s468">To such as plant for profit, I have already spoken.</s> <s id="s469">Let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground; and that plantations of larch, if introduced at all, may be confined to the highest and most barren tracts.</s> <s id="s470">Interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have been complaining; and the winds would take hold of the trees, and imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation.</s></p>
<p><s id="s471">Having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected or at least very sparingly used, by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country; and having shown what kinds ought to be chosen; I should have given, if my limits had not already been overstepped, a few pratical rules for the manner in which trees ought to be disposed in planting.</s> <s id="s472">But to this subject I should attach little importance, if I could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity, and could prevail upon the proprietor to confine himself either to those found in then native woods, or to such as accord with them.</s> <s id="s473">This is, indeed, the main point; for, much as these scenes have been injured by what has been taken from them-- buildings, trees, and woods, either through negligence, necessity, avarice, or caprice-- it is not the removals, but the harsh additions that have been made, which are the worst grievance-- a standing and unavoidable annoyance.</s> <s id="s474">Often have I felt this distinction with mingled satisfaction and regret; for, if no positive deformity or discordance be substituted or superinduced, such is the benignity of nature that, take away from her beauty after beauty, and ornament after ornament, her appearance cannot be marred-- the scars, if any be left, will gradually disappear before a healing spirit; and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing.</s> <s id="s475">--</s></p>

<p><s id="s477">There are few ancient woods left in this part of <enamex  sw="w112082" name="Large admin unit">England</enamex> upon which such indiscriminate ravage as is here" deplored," could now be committed.</s> <s id="s478">But, out of the numerous copses, fine woods might in time be raised, probably without sacrifice of profit, by leaving, at the periodical fellings, a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into timber.</s> <s id="s479">-- This plan has fortunately, in many instances, been adopted; and they, who have set the example, are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste.</s> <s id="s480">As to the management of planting with reasonable attention to the ornament, let the images of nature be your guide, and the whole secret lurks in a few words; thickets or underwoods-- single trees-- trees clustered or in groups-- groves-- unbroken woods, but with varied masses of foliage-- glades-- invisible or winding boundaries-- in rocky districts, a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare, and other parts half hidden-- disagreeable objects concealed, and formal lines broken-- trees climbing up to the horizon, and, in some places, ascending from its sharp edge, in which they are rooted, with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the the clear sky-- in other parts, woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked, which add to the sense of height as if vegetation could not thither be carried, and impress a feeling of duration, power of resistance, and security from change!</s></p>
<p><s id="s481">I have been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district, because still farther changes in its appearance must inevitably follow, from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place.</s> <s id="s482">-- About the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country, and to feel a desire to settle in it, the difficulty, that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations, was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry, proceeding from a cause which then began to operate, and is now from a cause which then began to operate, and is now felt in every house.</s> <s id="s483">The family of each man, whether estatesman or farmer, formerly had a twofold support; first, the produce of his lands and flocks; and secondly, the profit drawn from the employment of women and children, as manufacturers; spinning their own wool in their own houses( work chiefly done in the winter season) and carrying it to market for sale.</s> <s id="s484">Hence, however numerous the children, the income of the family kept pace with its increase.</s> <s id="s485">But, by the invention and universal application of machinery, this second resource has been cut off; the gains being so far reduced, as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment.</s> <s id="s486">Doubtless, the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss; for the profits arising from home-manufacturers operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry.</s> <s id="s487">They also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of produce of land, brought about by the establishment of manufactories, and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry.</s> <s id="s488">But this is far from making them amends; and now that home-manufacturers are nearly done away, women and children might, at many seasons of the year, employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do, yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined, and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital.</s> <s id="s489">The consequence, then, is-- that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms, several are united in one, and the buildings go to decay, or are destroyed; and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them, they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers, who in like manner unite and consolidate; and, if they wish to become residents, erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages, whose little enclosures, with all the wild graces that grew out of them, disappear.</s> <s id="s490">The feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers; but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured; and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the Lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of Gentry, either strangers or natives.</s> <s id="s491">It is then much to be wished, that a better taste should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which, without design and unconsciously, their humble predecessors have moved.</s> <s id="s492">In this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole Island, who, by their visits( often repeated) to the Lakes in the North of <enamex  sw="w116962" name="Large admin unit">England</enamex>, testify that they deem the district a sort of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy.</s></p>
<p><s id="s493">Miscellaneous Observations.</s>
</p>
<p><s id="s494">Mr. West, in his well-known Guide to the Lakes, recommends, as the best season for visiting this country, the interval from the beginning of June to the end of August; and, the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure, it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither.</s> <s id="s495">But that season is by no means the best; the colouring of the mountains and woods, unless where they are diversified by rocks, is of too unvaried a green, as a large portion of the Vallies is allotted to hay-grass, some want of variety is found there also.</s> <s id="s496">The meadows, however, are sufficiently enlivened after hay-making begins, which is much later than in the southern part of the Island.</s> <s id="s497">A stonger objection is rainy weather, setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour, and continuing with a perseverance, that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain, which fall among the Abyssinian Mountains for the annual supply of the <enamex sw="w118125" long="34.11552047729492" lat="11.09429740905762" type="civila" gazref="unlock:14128339" name="Blue Nile" conf="0.8">Nile</enamex>.</s> <s id="s498">The months of September and October( particularly October) are generally attended with much finer weather; and the scenery is the, beyond comparison, more diversified, more splendid, and beautiful; but, on the other hand, short days prevent long excursions, and sharp and chill gales an unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors.</s> <s id="s499">Nevertheless, to the sincere admirer of Nature, who is in good health and spirits, and at liberty to make a choice, the six weeks following the 1st of September may be recommended in preference to July and August.</s> <s id="s500">For there is no inconveniece arising from the season which, to such a person, would not be amply recompensed by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired Vallies, into which discordant plantation, and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance.</s> <s id="s501">-- In such spots, at this season, there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour, through the whole scale of objects;-- in the tender green of the after-grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock, crowned by shrubs and trees;

<p><s id="s550">As a resident among the Lakes, I frequently hear the scenery of this country compared with that of the Alps; and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been incidentally said upon that subject.</s></p>
<p><s id="s551">If we could recall, to this region of lakes, the native pine-forests, with which many hundred years ago a large portion of the heights was covered, then, during spring and autumn, it might frequently, with much propriety, be compared to <enamex  sw="w131063" name="Large admin unit">Switzerland</enamex>,-- the elements of the landscape would be the same-- one country representing the other in miniature.</s> <s id="s552">Villages, chruches, rural seats, bridges and roads; green meadows and arable grounds, with their various produce, and deciduous woods of diversified foliage which occupy the vales and lower regions of the mountains, would, as in <enamex  sw="w131408" name="Large admin unit">Switzerland</enamex>, be divided by dark forests from ridges and round-topped heights covered with snow, and from pikes and sharp declivities imperfectly arrayed in the same glittering mantle: and the resemblance would still be more perfect on those days when vapours resting upon, and floating around the summits, leave the elevation of the mountains less dependent upon the eye than on the imagination.</s> <s id="s553">But the pine-forests have wholly disappeared; and only during late Spring and early Autumn is realized here that assemblage of the imagery of different seasons, which is exhibited through the whole summer among the Alps-- winter in the distance,-- and warmth, leafy woods, verdure and fertility at hand,-- and widely diffused.</s></p>
<p><s id="s554">Striking, then, from among the permanent materials of the landscape, that stage of vegetation which is occupied by pine-forests, and, above that, the perennial snows, we have mountains, the highest of which little exceed 3000 feet, while some of the Alps do not fall short of 14,000 or 15,000, and 8,000 or 10,000 is not an uncommon elevation.</s> <s id="s555">Our tracts of wood and water are almost as diminutive in comparison; therefore, as far as sublimity is dependent upon absolute bulk or height, and atmospherical influence in connection with these, it is obvious, that there can be no rivalship.</s> <s id="s556">But a short residence among the <enamex  sw="w132754" name="Large admin unit">British Mountains</enamex> will furnish abundant proof, that, after a certain point, the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation to objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude; and, that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in the most impressive degree the creative and magnifying powers of the atmosphere; so that, on the score even of sublimity, the superiority of the Alps is be no means so great as might hastily be inferred;-- and, as to the beauty of the lower regions of the Swiss mountains, it is noticable-- that, as they are all regularly mown, their surface has nothing of the mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf, that is never touched by the scythe, is distinguished.</s> <s id="s557">On the smooth and steep slopes of the Swiss hills, these plots of verdure do indeed make a lively contrast of colour, with the dark green pine-groves that define them, and among which, they run in endless variety of shapes-- but this is most pleasing at first sight; the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone, and a more delicate blending of hues into each other.</s> <s id="s558">Besides, it is only in Spring and late Autumn that cattle animate by their presence the Swiss lawns; and, though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the Summer are left in their natural state of flowery herbage, those pastures are so remote, that their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the Vales is a feature.</s> <s id="s559">Yet in those lofty regions, how vegetation is invigorated by the genial climate of that country!
