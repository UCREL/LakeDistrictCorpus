  <p>ONE curio&#383;ity is apt to excite another; after vi&#383;iting <cdplace><i>Cro&#383;s-fells</i></cdplace>,<ptr target="n1"/> my inclinations led me to examine tho&#383;e of <cdplace><i>Caudebeck</i></cdplace>, that lateral detachment of the <i>Briti&#383;h <cdplace>Alps</cdplace></i>, which over&#383;preads great part of <cdplace><i>Cumberland</i></cdplace>, and di&#383;tingui&#383;hed by in&#383;uperable precipices, and tow&#8217;ring peaks, and exhibiting land&#383;kapes of a quite different and more romantic air than any part of the general ridge, and of nearer affinity to the <cdplace><i>Switzerland</i> Alps</cdplace>. My intention in this journey was to vi&#383;it the <i>Wadd-mines</i>, the peculiar product of the&#383;e mountains, and no where else di&#383;covered on the globe; but as they are kept clo&#383;e &#383;hut up, and the weather was extremely unfavourable, I deferred that examination to a more proper time, and contented my&#383;elf with the varieties in the neighbourhood of <cdplace><i>Mo&#383;e-dale</i></cdplace>; here I found villages in the narrow bottoms, that feel no more benefit from the &#383;olar rays for two months, about the winter &#383;olstice, than the old <i>Cimmerians</i>, or the <i>Laplanders</i> who inhabit about the North Cape of <cdplace><i>Norway</i></cdplace>.</p>
  <p><cdplace><i>Swin&#383;ted</i></cdplace> on <cdplace><i>Cauda</i></cdplace> is a strong in&#383;tance that the property of the <cdplace>Artic circle</cdplace> is not confined to tho&#383;e unhappy regions which lie within 23 degrees of the pole, e&#383;pecially with regard to the &#383;olar light.</p>
  <p>The&#383;e mountains differ not only in figure, but are very di&#383;&#383;imilar in property to the main body, being dry, &#383;mooth, and more agreeably verdant, where precipices occur not. The rocks upon which they are built, being of a fi&#383;&#383;ile ab&#383;orbent nature, &#383;erving to imbibe the de&#383;cending rains, which are thrown off from the more compact &#383;trata of the general ridge, and take broken and uneven cour&#383;es, through the loo&#383;e and &#383;pongey texture of their outward covering, forming &#383;ometimes mora&#383;&#383;es, but more frequently rotten bogs, and &#383;inuous mires of difficult pa&#383;&#383;age. No

  <note id="n1">Of which &#383;ee the de&#383;cription, <i>p</i>. 384-3.</note>
  <p>The mo&#383;t common plants which I ob&#383;erved are,</p>
  <p><i>Adianthum nigrum officinarum</i> (<i>of</i> Ray) black maiden hair.</p>
  <p><i>Lujula</i>, <i>aceto&#383;a &#383;ylve&#383;tris</i>, wood or mountain &#383;orrel.</p>
  <p><i>Mu&#383;cus &#383;quammo&#383;us montanus repens, &#383;abin&#230; folio</i></p>
  <p><i>Mu&#383;cus clavatus juniperinis foliis reflexis</i>, <i>clavis &#383;ingularibus &#383;ine pediculis</i>. Several mo&#383;&#383;es of the cap&#383;ulated kind.</p>
  <p>Bru&#383;h mo&#383;s.</p>
  <p><i>Rorella longifolia perennis</i>, and other &#383;un-dews.</p>
  <p>The &#383;hrubs ri&#383;ing from the latices of the rocks, are dwarf birch, dwarf mountain oak, of &#383;o untractable a genius that no &#383;oil will meliorate it.</p>
  <p><i>Fraxinus &#383;ylve&#383;tris</i>, <i>ornus montana</i>, wild mountain a&#383;h, with red fruit. I do not remember to have &#383;een this tree in the South, nearer than <i>Derby&#383;hire</i>; it differs both in &#383;ize and leaf from the &#383;ervice tree, of which &#383;pecies it is, according to the botani&#383;ts, and is very ripe; the &#383;uper&#383;titious u&#383;e it again&#383;t witchcraft.</p>
  <p>The only bird peculiar to the&#383;e rocks is the raven.</p>
  <p>It is a received <cdplace><i>Cumberland</i></cdplace> proverb, that the mountains of <cdplace><i>Caudebeck</i></cdplace> are worth all <cdplace><i>England</i></cdplace> besides, but it has not yet been verify&#8217;d by experience; and if we may be allow&#8217;d to conjecture from the nature of their &#383;tones, found in the rivulets and quarries, it may be difficult to &#383;say when they will. Mo&#383;t of their lapilli are a fluor of the &#383;talactite kind, or a &#383;parry talc re&#383;embling white flint, variegated with hexagonal cry&#383;talline &#383;pars, who&#383;e points will cut gla&#383;s like the adamant, but immediately lo&#383;e that property from their fragile quality. Others are impregnanted with the marca&#383;ite of lead, but &#383;o blended with an ar&#383;enical &#383;ulphur that they evaporate in the proce&#383;s of &#383;eparation, and others are of the copperas kind; all of them contained &#383;uch heterogeneal qualities in their composition, as never to yield a proper gratification for the tryal. Their quarries, al&#383;o, only abound with a fi&#383;&#383;ile bluei&#383;h &#383;late, u&#383;eful for the covering of their hou&#383;es, but very remote from the metalline nature: Indeed in <cdplace><i>Brandlegill-beck</i></cdplace>, and the Northern de&#383;cents, copper has been formerly dug, but the mines are long &#383;ince worn out; hereabouts the <i>lapis calaminaris</i> is al&#383;o found.</p>
  <p>Under mount <cdplace><i>Skiddow</i></cdplace> is the head of the <cdplace>river <i>Cauda</i></cdplace>; it i&#383;&#383;ues thro&#8217; a narrow trough, and takes its winding cour&#383;e with great rapidity to <cdplace><i>Mo&#383;edale</i></cdplace>, where it turns northward for <cdplace><i>Carli&#383;le</i></cdplace>. Near two miles above that village (<cdplace><i>Mo&#383;edale</i></cdplace>) it receives a &#383;mall rivulet from <cdplace><i>Bou&#383;cale-tarn</i></cdplace>, a lake near a mile in circumference, on the &#383;ide of a high mountain, &#383;o &#383;trangely &#383;urrounded with a more eminent amphitheatrical ridge of quarry rocks, that it is excluded the benefit of the &#383;un for a lea&#383;t four months, in the middle of winter; but this is not its only &#383;ingularity. Several of the mo&#383;t credible inhabitants thereabouts, affirming that they frequently &#383;ee the &#383;tars in it at mid-day; but in order to di&#383;cover that ph&#230;nomenon, the firmament mu&#383;t be perfectly clear, the air &#383;table, and the water unagitated. The&#383;e circum&#383;tances not concurring at the time I was there, depriv&#8217;d me of the plea&#383;ure of that &#383;ight, and of recommending it to the naturali&#383;ts upon my own ocular evidence, which I regret the want of, as I que&#383;tion if the like has been any where el&#383;e ob&#383;erved. The &#383;pectator mu&#383;t be &#383;ituated at lea&#383;t 200 yards above the lake, and as much below the &#383;ummit of the &#383;emi-ambient ridge; and as there are other high mountains, which in that po&#383;ition may break and deaden the &#383;olar rays, I can only give an implicit credit to the power of their agency, &#8217;till I am convinc&#8217;d of their effects, and am qualified to &#383;end it better recommended to the publick.</p>
  <p>At <cdplace><i>Gri&#383;edale</i></cdplace> the water turns both ways, &#383;o that in a sudden &#383;hower you may with your foot only, &#383;end the rain-water, either to <cdplace><i>Carli&#383;le</i></cdplace> or <cdplace><i>Cockermouth</i></cdplace>, by the channels of <cdplace><i>Cauda</i></cdplace> or <cdplace><i>Lender-maken</i></cdplace>. This la&#383;t &#383;prings under <cdplace><i>Sadle back</i></cdplace>, a <cdplace><i>Parna&#383;&#383;ian</i></cdplace> eminence, with two prominent peaks; the mo&#383;t northernly is called <cdplace><i>Blencarter</i></cdplace>, a &#383;urprizingly high precipice of the quarry kind.</p>
  <p><cdplace><i>Souter-fell</i></cdplace> is a di&#383;tingui&#383;h&#8217;d mountain of it&#383;elf, encompa&#383;s&#8217;d quite round with a <i>turbinated</i> trough, thro&#8217; which <cdplace><i>Lender-maken</i></cdplace> is convey&#8217;d. The We&#383;t and North &#383;ides are barricadoed with rocks, the Ea&#383;t is more plain but withal &#383;teep, and &#383;eemingly 900 yards in height, but every where of difficult acce&#383;s. It was on this <i>Fell</i> that the a&#383;tonishing ph&#230;nomenon appear&#8217;d to exhibit it&#383;elf, which in 1735, 1737 and 1745 made &#383;o much noi&#383;e in the North, that I went on purpo&#383;e to examine the &#383;pectators, who a&#383;&#383;erted the fact, and continue in their a&#383;&#383;ertion very po&#383;itively to this day.</p>
 
<pb n="524"/>
  <p>On <i>Mid&#383;ummer</i> eve 1735, <cdperson><i>Wm Lanca&#383;ter</i>&#8217;s</cdperson> &#383;ervant related that he &#383;aw the Ea&#383;t &#383;ide of <i>Souter-fell</i>, towards the top, covered with a regular marching army for above an hour together; he &#383;aid they con&#383;i&#383;ted of distinct bodies of troops, which appeared to proceed from an eminence in the North end, and march&#8217;d over a nitch in the top, [mark&#8217;d A and B in my drawing] but as no other per&#383;on in the neighbourhood had &#383;een the like, he was di&#383;credited and laugh&#8217;d at. Two years after on <i>Mid&#383;ummer</i> eve also, betwixt the hours of eight and nine, <cdperson><i>Wm Lancaster</i></cdperson> him&#383;elf imagined that &#383;everal gentlemen were following their hor&#383;es at a di&#383;tance, as if they had been hunting, and taking them for &#383;uch, pay&#8217;d no regard to it, till about ten minutes after, again turning his head towards the place, they appeared to be mounted, and a va&#383;t army following, five in rank, crowding over at the &#383;ame place, where the &#383;ervant &#383;aid he &#383;aw them two years before. He then call&#8217;d his family, who all agreed in the &#383;ame opinion; and what was mo&#383;t extraordinary, he frequently ob&#383;erved that &#383;ome one of the five would quit rank, and &#383;eem to &#383;tand in a fronting po&#383;ture, as if he was ob&#383;erving and regulating the order of their march, or taking account of the numbers, and after &#383;ome time appear&#8217;d to return full gallop to the &#383;tation he had left, which they never fail&#8217;d to do as often as they quitted their lines, and the figure that did &#383;o, was generally one of the middlemost men in the rank. As it grew later, they &#383;eem&#8217;d more regardle&#383;s of di&#383;cipline, and rather had the appearance of people riding from a market, than an army, tho&#8217; they continued crowding on, and marching off, as long as they had light to &#383;ee them.</p>
  <p>This ph&#230;nomenon was no more &#383;een &#8217;till the <i>Mid&#383;ummer</i> eve, which preceded the rebellion, when they were determined to call more families to be witnes&#383;s of this &#383;ight, and accordingly went to <cdplace><i>Wilton-hill</i></cdplace> and <cdplace><i>Souter-fell-&#383;ide</i></cdplace>, till they conven&#8217;d about 26 per&#383;ons, who all affirm they then &#383;aw the &#383;ame appearance, but not conducted with the u&#383;ual regularity as the preceding ones, having the likeness of carriages inter&#383;persed; however it did not appear to be le&#383;s real, for &#383;ome of the company were so affected with it as in the morning to climb the mountain, through an idle expectation of finding hor&#383;e-&#383;hoes, after &#383;o numerous an army, but they &#383;aw not the ve&#383;tige or print of a foot.</p>
  <p><cdperson><i>Wm Lancaster</i></cdperson>, indeed, told me that he never concluded they were real beings, becau&#383;e of the impracticability of a march over the precipices, where they seem&#8217;d to come on; that the night was extremely &#383;erene; that hor&#383;e and man upon &#383;trict looking at appear&#8217;d to be but one being, rather than two di&#383;tinct ones; they were nothing like any clouds or vapours, which he had ever perceiv&#8217;d el&#383;ewhere; that their number was incredible, for they fill&#8217;d lengthways near half a mile, and continued so in a &#383;wift march for above an hour, and much longer he thinks if night had kept off.</p>
  <p>This whole &#383;tory has &#383;o much the air of a romance, that it &#383;eem&#8217;d fitter for <i>Amadis de Gaul</i>, or <i>Glanville&#8217;ls &#383;y&#383;tem of Witches</i>, than the repo&#383;itory of the learned; but as the country was full of it, I only give a verbatim from the original relation of a people, that could have no end in impo&#383;ing on their fellow-creatures, and are of good repute in the place where they live.</p>
  <p>It is my real opinion, that they apprehended they &#383;aw &#383;uch appearances, but how an undulating lambent meteor could affect the optics of &#383;o many people is difficult to &#383;ay. No doubt fancy will extend to miraculous heights in per&#383;ons di&#383;po&#383;&#8217;d to indulge it; and whether there might not be a concurrence of that, to a&#383;&#383;ist the vapour, I will not di&#383;pute, becau&#383;e three difficulties &#383;eem to occur, worthy of &#383;olution.<ptr target="n2"/></p>
  <p>1<i>&#383;t</i>, Why a lambent agitated meteor &#383;hould appear to &#383;top at certain intervals, and return with augmented velocity to rea&#383;&#383;ume the for&#383;aken place.</p>
  <p>2<i>d</i>, Why it &#383;hould for a very long time pre&#383;erve &#383;o regular a &#383;y&#383;tem, as to appear &#383;till five in a line.</p>
  <p>3<i>d</i>. Why one particular evening in the year, only, exhibited the unu&#383;ual meteor for three times, at &#383;o long intervals.</p>
  <p> As the&#383;e are at pre&#383;ent beyond my philo&#383;ophy to explain, it may be an amu&#383;ement to &#383;uch as will give them&#383;elves the trouble of enquiry, having neither added nor dimini&#383;hed to the

  accounts given me. Tho&#383;e who treat it as a mere illu&#383;ion or <i>deceptio vi&#383;us</i>, &#383;hould a&#383;&#383;ign rea&#383;ons for &#383;o large a fa&#383;cination in above 20 per&#383;ons; probably one, indeed, might &#383;erve to aggrandize the fancy of others, but I &#383;hould think they could not be &#383;o univer&#383;ally deceiv&#8217;d without &#383;ome &#383;tamina of the likene&#383;s exhibited on the mountain from a meteor, or some unknown cause.</p>
  <note id="n2">To this relation we may add that in the &#383;pring of the year 1707, early in a &#383;erene &#383;till morning, was ob&#383;erved by two per&#383;ons, one of the name of <i>Churchhill</i>, who were walking from one village to another in <cdplace><i>Leice&#383;ter&#383;hire</i></cdplace>, a like appearance of an army marching along, till going behind a great hill, it di&#383;appeared.--The forms of pikes and carbines were di&#383;tingui&#383;hable, the arch was not entirely in one direction, but was at the fir&#383;t like the junction of two armies, and the meeting of generals.</note>
  <p>It is &#383;ingularly remarkable, that mo&#383;t of all the&#383;e mountains have their precipices fronting the We&#383;t and Northwe&#383;t, which is a &#383;trong collateral proof of the Earth&#8217;s motion, becau&#383;e the diurnal revolution would naturally throw off all the loo&#383;e &#383;trata in its fluid &#383;tate to the oppo&#383;ite quarter, and the concurring &#383;uffrage of travellers in the &#383;ame properties of foreign mountains, where rea&#383;ons are not obvious for their being otherwi&#383;e, much &#383;trengthens the argument.</p>
  <p>I &#383;hall re&#383;erve my further ob&#383;ervations in my &#383;urveys of the &#383;everal parts of <cdplace><i>England</i></cdplace> for your intended new maps. Tho&#383;e which have of late appeared are entirely old things, and not worth looking on; for tho&#8217; you mention but eleven parks omitted in that of <cdplace><i>Berks</i></cdplace>, I could not imagine that a noble duke&#8217;s &#383;eat &#383;o near <cdplace><i>London</i></cdplace> and the pre&#383;ent road to the &#383;hire town &#383;hould be omitted; &#383;o that I need not wonder at their lo&#383;ing credit every day.</p>
