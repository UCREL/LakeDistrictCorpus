<p>From hence an excellent road &#383;oon brought us to a very &#383;triking pro&#383;pect of the &#383;ea on our left hand, with the ancient county town of <cdplace>Lanca&#383;ter</cdplace> (or <cdplace>Lonca&#383;ter</cdplace> from the <cdplace>river Lone</cdplace>,) nobly &#383;ituated in front; the elevated &#383;ite of its &#383;trong ca&#383;tle gives the mind a mo&#383;t magnificent idea of this important place; and what renders this &#383;cene &#383;till more &#383;triking is the church, a fine gothic building, placed on the &#383;ame elevation, which, from &#383;ome points of view, forms one group with the ca&#383;tle. </p>

<pb n="55"/>

<p>There is little doubt but this town has been famous in the annals of hi&#383;tory and antiquity; and its late improvements are very con&#383;iderable, &#383;everal new &#383;treets have been added, be&#383;ides a hand&#383;ome chapel, and other public edifices; the quay is tolerably good, and the inhabitants are bu&#383;ied in a fine trade to <cdplace>Guinea</cdplace> and the <cdplace>We&#383;t-Indies</cdplace>. Be&#383;ides a fair old bridge over this <cdplace>river Lone</cdplace>, they are now fini&#383;hing a very hand&#383;ome new one of five equal elliptical arches; the whole length is about 549 feet, its &#383;tyle of building plain and elegant; it is ju&#383;t made pa&#383; &#383;able, and, when complete, will be &#383;uperior to mo&#383;t in <cdplace>England</cdplace>. In the evening we went to look at <cdperson>Mr. Gray&apos;s</cdperson> view of the <cdplace>vale of Lon&#383;dale</cdplace>, from a field about three miles on the <cdplace>Queen&apos;s Road</cdplace>. It is certainly a very beautiful land&#383;cape, but more worthy the minute attention of an artist, than to &#383;trike with raptures the 

<pb n="56" />

eye of a traveller. I think there are great beauties to the right of this &#383;tation unnoticed by either <cdperson>Gray</cdperson> or <cdperson>We&#383;t</cdperson>. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>Leaving this place, the next object of our tour was to vi&#383;it tho&#383;e grand &#383;cenes, the lakes of <cdplace>We&#383;tmorland</cdplace> and <cdplace>Cumberland</cdplace>. But the&#383;e having been the &#383;ubjects of &#383;eparate volumes by <cdperson>Mr. We&#383;t</cdperson> and <cdperson>Gilpin</cdperson>, I &#383;hall not expatiate much upon them, but refer occa&#383;ionally to the former as a true and faithful guide. </p>

<p>About ten o&apos;clock in the morning of Augu&#383;t the 7th, the &#383;un beaming delightfully, and promi&#383;ing us a mo&#383;t agreeable day, we cro&#383;s&apos;d the &#383;ands from <cdplace>He&#383;t-bank</cdplace> without any other guide than a nece&#383; &#383;ary driver on a fore-hor&#383;e to our gig. On entering this exten&#383;ive plain of eleven miles we were then going to traver&#383;e, and on the left &#383;eeing a gra-

<pb n="57" />

dual increa&#383;e of the &#383;ame &#383;urface till the eye is lo&#383;t upon the withdrawn ocean, and on the right, contra&#383;ted to it, a multitude of grand mountainous objects, <cdplace>Ingleborough</cdplace>, <cdplace>Warton-cragg</cdplace>, &#38;c. &#383;o accurately and well de&#383;cribed in page 27 of <cdperson>We&#383;t</cdperson>. Such a new and magnificent &#383;cene could not fail to impre&#383;s our minds with ideas of delight and a&#383;toni&#383;hment. The&#383;e &#383;ands too are rendered lively by the pa&#383; &#383;ing and repa&#383; &#383;ing of men, carriages, and droves of cattle, all anxious to embrace this one opportunity in 24 hours. But what renders this &#383;cenery more enchanting and wonderful, is to ob&#383;erve at the feet of the&#383;e formidable mountains &#383;eats, villages, and cots, &#383;urrounded with mo&#383;t excellent wood and verdure, as if nature, wi&#383;hing to give both food for the mind and body in great abundance, had cleared the fore-ground of every u&#383;ele&#383;s atom to make it rich and fertile, and had thrown 

<pb n="58" />

her craggy matter in heaps of wilde&#383;t order to form the back ground of the land&#383;cape more &#383;ublime and perfect. </p>

<note id="n1">Uncle to the Duke. This &#383;eat, I think, belonged to the <cdperson>Pre&#383;tons</cdperson>.</note>
<p>Having pa&#383; &#383;ed the&#383;e &#383;ands to <cdplace>Carklane</cdplace>, we next came to <cdplace>Flockborough</cdplace>, the &#383;mall remains of a market town. Here, in&#383;tead of pur&#383;uing the common road to <cdplace>Leven-&#383;ands</cdplace>, we deviated to the right about a mile through a village, and by a large cotton mill belonging to a company of <cdplace>Lanca&#383;hire</cdplace> Gentlemen, in order to &#383;ee <cdplace>Holker-hall</cdplace>, the &#383;eat of <cdperson>Lord George Cavendi&#383;h</cdperson><ptr target="n1"/>, which we found nothing remarkable in its building, but admirable in point of &#383;ituation: in the mid&#383;t of a beautiful park, well wooded, the boundaries one way &#383;loping towards the &#383;ea, the other a&#383;cending to the feet of inacce&#383; &#383;ible rocks and mountains. Leaving this well adorned &#383;pot, we now entered upon the &#383;ands again that lead directly three miles over to <cdplace>Ulver&#383;ton</cdplace>. 



<pb n="59" />

This pa&#383; &#383;age is very &#383;imilar to what we had ju&#383;t left behind, the &#383;urrounding objects beautiful as the former, except that now being advanced fifteen miles nearer, the back ground of Alpenine heights thrown rudely on each other, became more horribly magnificent. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p><cdplace>Ulver&#383;ton</cdplace> is a neat market town at the bottom of immen&#383;e hills, near the water &#383;ide, and is properly called the <cdplace>London</cdplace> of <cdplace>Furne&#383;s</cdplace>. About a mile and a half to the &#383;outh of this &#383;tands <cdplace>Coni&#383;head priory</cdplace>, richly &#383;urrounded with woods and &#383;loping groves. As &#383;oon as we had taken a comfortable refre&#383;hment, the afternoon being uncommonly favourable, we rode to this delicious place, which did not fail to an&#383;wer our mo&#383;t &#383;anguine expectations. The hou&#383;e is not very large, but admirably adapted to its &#383;ingular &#383;ituation; the plan on which the grounds and gardens are &#383;o 

<pb n="60" />

highly fini&#383;hed is worthy the imitation of every adorner of nature. To enter into a minute de&#383;cription of this <cdplace>Eden</cdplace> of the north would be here &#383;uperfluous, and only humbly walking in the foot-&#383;teps of one who has made this a prime feature in his tour. (Vide <cdperson>We&#383;t</cdperson>, pages 42, 43, &#38;c.) The gardener who attended us through this beauteous &#383;cenery was very civil and intelligent, and mentioned &#383;everal intended improvements with great &#383;atisfaction. The pre&#383;ent owner of this &#383;weet &#383;pot greatly &#383;hews his ta&#383;te by &#383;till continuing what his predece&#383; &#383;or had &#383;o nobly begun. Fortune he enjoys equal to every execution of this kind. During our &#383;tay here, we &#383;aw that change take place in the &#383;urrounding ocean which mu&#383;t appear mo&#383;t wonderful to tho&#383;e who are unacquainted with the my&#383;terious laws of its irre&#383;i&#383;tible motion, and cannot fail to affect every ob&#383;erver in a very &#383;ublime

and awful manner. That plain, which but a few hours before was but a &#383;ea of &#383;and, we now beheld immer&#383;ed in fathoms of water. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>Having &#383;pent this evening &#383;o much to our &#383;atisfaction, we now retired to our Inn, the Sun, which, though in point of building not very elegant or accommodating, yet the neatne&#383;s of provi&#383;ions and cookery exceeded any in a &#383;mall way we had before experienced. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>The next morning, which was glorious as the preceding, we went the ride recommended by <cdperson>Mr. We&#383;t</cdperson>, to &#383;ee the magnificent ruins of <cdplace>Furne&#383;s Abbey</cdplace>, which are worth much attention, and cannot fail giving infinite &#383;atisfaction to every beholder. The &#383;eque&#383;tered vale in which this mona&#383;tic edifice once reared its sacred pile, is truly eligible,

and be&#383;t adapted to a life of contemplation. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>Here we gazed &#383;ome time with re&#383;pect and reverence on the havock which time had made upon this &#383;urprizing &#383;tructure. And how erroneous &#383;oever tho&#383;e notions of religion may be e&#383;teemed, that thus called mankind, from the &#383;ocial duties of the world, to put on this rigid and moro&#383;e garb of piety; yet &#383;ecretly we mu&#383;t admire that fervent zeal which cau&#383;ed the&#383;e wonderful exertions of human art to rai&#383;e up buildings who&#383;e beauty and magnificence might well accord with the ideas of that &#383;upreme Being to whom they were dedicated. Full of &#383;uch ardent reflections on the various prejudices of the world, and the undurable works of man, we returned the &#383;ame rough and unplea&#383;ant road, the motto &quot; &#383;ic tran&#383;it gloria mundi&quot; continuing uppermo&#383;t the greate&#383;t part of

the way; during which nothing curious or entertaining attracts the notice of the traveller, except an abundance of &#383;mall unweildy carriages pa&#383; &#383;ing and repa&#383; &#383;ing with the produce of the neighbouring iron mines to the &#383;hipping at <cdplace>Barrow</cdplace>, about three miles beyond the <cdplace>Abbey</cdplace>. I enquired into the rea&#383;on of this heavy con&#383;truction of their carts, and found it nece&#383; &#383;ary that they &#383;hould be &#383;trong to bear the uncommon burden of this ore; but it is inexcu&#383;able in the common bu&#383;ine&#383;s of the country, and only ignorance or prejudice that can be the cau&#383;e of incumbering one hor&#383;e with wheels that are &#383;carce moveable, &#383;o low and ma&#383; &#383;y is their uncouth form. It was in this morning&apos;s excur&#383;ion, that I fir&#383;t was &#383;truck with the &#383;implicity of northern manners, where every native that pa&#383; &#383;es by &#383;alutes you with a goodmorrow, in &#383;uch a familiar voice of welcome, as cannot fail to plea&#383;e; and

which &#383;avours more of &#383;incerity and good will, than the more &#383;tudied refinements and gracious &#383;miles of the beau monde. After having again regaled on the neat and palatable repa&#383;t of our ho&#383;te&#383;s, we bid adieu to this plea&#383;ant little town, and proceeded eight miles by <cdplace>Lovick-bridge</cdplace> to <cdplace>Coni&#383;ton-water</cdplace>. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>About half way, on a gently ri&#383;ing hill, we fir&#383;t caught &#383;ight of this plea&#383;ing lake, which we traced as directed in pages 47, 48, &#38;c. of our guide. Station the fir&#383;t; a little above the village of <cdplace>Nithwaite</cdplace> we enjoyed the &#383;everal pictures he very accurately points out. We al&#383;o ob&#383;erved farther on at his &#383;econd &#383;tation, the variegated &#383;cenes he there de&#383;cribes; the bays, the promontaries, the diver&#383;ified groups of &#383;eque&#383;tered cots, green &#383;lopes and wood crowned eminences, together with the range of naked mountains, clad in &#383;able hue, all

<p>His third &#383;tation cannot very readily be found out after the manner in which he has expre&#383; &#383;ed it, at lea&#383;t we were greatly confu&#383;ed in following his direction. If I might be permitted to elucidate this erroneous pa&#383; &#383;age, it &#383;hould be by altering his direction thus: after having ob&#383;erved the yew tree on the common, and the tree on the penin&#383;ula which he de&#383;cribes, then pa&#383;s thro&apos; the fir&#383;t gate, and continue on the road to a &#383;econd, which opening you will &#383;ee the &#383;mall rivulet and bridge, he mentions, a few yards before you, and not in the grove, for that is all along inclo&#383;ed by a flight hedge to the right. Proceed about one hundred yards farther and the

fragment of rock pre&#383;ents it&#383;elf near the road in the water. Here we had a very &#383;atisfactory view of the cry&#383;tal lake to its greate&#383;t extent, and the <cdplace>We&#383;tmorland</cdplace> fells tow&apos;ring on the oppo&#383;ite &#383;hore have a noble appearance. The views from every part of <cdplace>Coni&#383;ton-water</cdplace> mu&#383;t be allowed beautiful, yet they give an agreeable &#383;atisfaction to the mind rather than &#383;trike the eye with ravi&#383;hment and wonder. The char here are e&#383;teemed particularly fine, and are taken both late and early in the &#383;ea&#383;on. Thus having &#383;atisfied this part of our curio&#383;ity we pur&#383;ued the road about four miles rather inclining to the ea&#383;t, which brought us to the &#383;mall town of <cdplace>Hawk&#383;head</cdplace>, the place appointed for this night&apos;s abode; but the evening was too far advanced to permit our enjoying the fine pro&#383;pect, which the &#383;everal hills we pa&#383; &#383;ed over would otherwi&#383;e have afforded. We found a comfortable en-

tertainment at the Red Lion, the only hou&#383;e of re&#383;ort for travellers; and the next morning continuing bright and charming as before, we &#383;et off about &#383;even for the ferry on <cdplace>Windermere lake</cdplace>, and pa&#383; &#383;ing over a bridge about half a mile down the vale, came upon the margin of <cdplace>E&#383;thwaite-water</cdplace>; a &#383;weet little oval lake, two miles long and one broad. Hear the &#383;erenity of the morning afforded us the mo&#383;t delightful ride imaginable, for not a breeze &#383;tirring, the watery &#383;urface became a perfect mirror, and reflected the inverted land&#383;cape more &#383;oftly coloured than ever art or nature had before pre&#383;ented to our view. Indeed the neat village of <cdplace>Hawk&#383;head</cdplace>, with its milk-white tower, and &#383;everal cots and groves which project this way, together with the over-hanging trees, and mountains, form a mo&#383;t compleat group for the pencil of the Arti&#383;t.

ed the &#383;ummit of the hill which fir&#383;t pre&#383;ents that glory of the&#383;e lakes, <cdplace>Windermere-water</cdplace>; hence continuing round a rocky mountain northwards, we came without difficulty to <cdperson>Mr. We&#383;t&apos;s</cdperson> fir&#383;t &#383;tation; and mounting the craggy &#383;ummit, we were delighted with innumerable beauties of lake, wood and i&#383;land, diver&#383;ified in all the various windings and inter&#383;ections of wonderful nature, &#383;urrounded by all the grandeur of near and di&#383;tant mountains hanging one upon another in mo&#383;t &#383;urprizing forms; but not contented with this elevated &#383;ituation, we a&#383;cended the jutting rock above with much difficulty, and reaped no advantage from our labor; the&#383;e giddy heights only adding horror to the &#383;cene without its former &#383;oftened beauties; from whence de&#383;cending even on our hands and knees, we were glad to find our&#383;elves again on terra firma, and pur&#383;uing the road directly to the ferry, we were &#383;oon

Leaving our hor&#383;es at a &#383;mall ale-hou&#383;e, we took a boat to vi&#383;it the large i&#383;land, now belonging to <cdperson>John Chri&#383;tian, E&#383;q.</cdperson> of <cdplace>Unerig</cdplace>, in <cdplace>Cumberland</cdplace>, who&#383;e elegant improvements are numerous and prai&#383;eworthy, &#383;ince the ob&#383;ervations of <cdperson>Mr. Hutchin&#383;on</cdperson> and other vi&#383;itors, who&#383;e remarks mu&#383;t be deemed too cen&#383;orious and unju&#383;t, the &#383;lopes and meandring walks are both proper and ornamental; nor can the change of building on its pre&#383;ent &#383;cale be deemed unnatural or improper; for it cannot be &#383;uppo&#383;ed that a gentleman of exten&#383;ive fortune, can in the&#383;e luxurious days, when convenience and art &#383;pread them&#383;elves to the remote&#383;t parts of the kingdom, confine him-

<p>After having thus enjoyed our&#383;elves from the principal points of the lake, and the morning being far advanced, we omitted going lower down the lake, but went from hence to the fifth &#383;tation, where <cdperson>Mr. Young</cdperson> took his general view of the lake, and di&#383;covered that croud of new beauties which he &#383;o finely de&#383;cribes, as quoted by <cdperson>Mr. We&#383;t</cdperson>. This indeed, was &#383;uperlatively grand, and mu&#383;t undoubtedly at a critical hour, beggar all attempts of language to give an adequate idea of its &#383;urpri&#383;ing charms. Had we arrived on the &#383;ummit of this hill at our fir&#383;t approach towards the lake, we &#383;hould have hit the time to perfection; but the heat of the mid-day &#383;un produced a dimne&#383;s in the air rather unfavourable; yet as every &#383;tation cannot be obtained to the utmo&#383;t wi&#383;h of the ob&#383;erver moving in nece&#383; &#383;ary order, we were well &#383;atisfied, and returned full of delight.

<p>Taking leave of this &#383;ublime &#383;cene of wonder and delight, we concluded the day at <cdplace>Low-wood Inn</cdplace>, at the upper end of the lake, which is a good hou&#383;e, and delightfully &#383;ituated for the purpo&#383;e of receiving company who vi&#383;it the&#383;e uncommon romantic waters. </p>

<p>The afternoon increa&#383;ed in heat, which produced di&#383;tant rumblings in the skies that threatned new aweful &#383;cenes of mixt delight, but the evening became cool without much thunder, and the lowering clouds gave &#383;u&#383;picions of approaching rain. </p>

<p>The next morning the &#383;ame a&#383;pect continued, but it held up till we got a few miles on the cro&#383;s road towards <cdplace>Ulls-water</cdplace>, when the thick mi&#383;t, which hovered round the mountains, began to fall in mizzling &#383;howers, which gave little hopes of plea&#383;ure or advantage from this day&apos;s excur&#383;ion: gaining the &#383;ummit of <cdplace>Kirk&#383;ton-hills</cdplace> we could &#383;carce di&#383;cern beyond our hor&#383;es heads while the deep vale beneath, through the intervals of gleaming light, di&#383;played a &#383;cene rarely to be met with, and which the following lines in <cdtitle>Beatties Min&#383;trel</cdtitle> only can de&#383;cribe. </p>

<p>But as we began to de&#383;cend into the vale of <cdplace>Kirk&#383;ton</cdplace>, who&#383;e &#383;loping rocks of immen&#383;e height, form a mo&#383;t curious rude avenue to the &#383;mall lake of <cdplace>Broad-water</cdplace>, and its &#383;urrounding meads; here the clouds opening at intervals gave &#383;ome faint glimmerings of &#383;un-&#383;hine, which afforded a plea&#383;ant variety of light and &#383;hade, and hopes of a better day. We had never till now been &#383;o much among&#383;t the&#383;e wonderful rocks, as to have them hang in rude magnificence around our heads, which rendered this ride peculiarly &#383;triking. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>Advancing now towards the lake of  <cdplace>Ulls-water</cdplace>, we pa&#383; &#383;ed through the reclu&#383;e village of <cdplace>Paterdale</cdplace>, which takes its name from <cdperson>St. Patrick</cdperson>, and a little beyond are yet vi&#383;ible the remains of a well on the road &#383;ide, where he is &#383;aid fir&#383;t to have performed the office of bapti&#383;mal rites. </p>

<pb n="75" />

<p>A little onward, the lake di&#383;plays a new &#383;cene of beauties to the a&#383;toni&#383;hed beholder, for &#383;till different from tho&#383;e we had yet &#383;een, its &#383;urrounding rocks hang in wilde&#383;t order over its reflecting &#383;urface; <cdplace>Martindale-fell</cdplace>, <cdplace>Swark-fell</cdplace>, <cdplace>Skelling-nab</cdplace>, and <cdplace>Place-fell</cdplace> are bold features on one side of this part of the lake, and on the oppo&#383;ite, <cdplace>Yew-crag</cdplace>, <cdplace>Gow-barrow-park</cdplace>, &#38;c. This lake differs from the re&#383;t, from its meandring &#383;treams only permitting one reach to be viewed at a time. As we here entered upon its large&#383;t and mo&#383;t particular beauties, we did not think it nece&#383; &#383;ary to traver&#383;e nine or ten miles down to its utmo&#383;t boundaries, as the day was far advanced, and at intervals the &#383;howers became di&#383;agreeable. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>During one of the&#383;e heavy &#383;howers we took &#383;helter at a &#383;mall pot-hou&#383;e below the village, where we di&#383;covered a cha-

<pb n="76" />

racter which gave us more entertainment and &#383;atisfaction than all the outward beauties of the place. At our entrance into this public hut, we ob&#383;erved three common men in bu&#383;y conver&#383;ation in an adjacent room, and thinking to get &#383;ome intelligence by their company, introduced our&#383;elves with &#383;ome trifling que&#383;tions about the lake, when we received an an&#383;wer from the middlemo&#383;t, which, from its pointed manner of delivery, and coming from one who&#383;e countenance was marked with &#383;trong traces of under&#383;tanding, much belyed the outward appearance of his dre&#383;s. His companions began now humorou&#383;ly to give me the &#383;everal titles which his callings had fixed upon him, viz. Charon, pari&#383;h clerk, and &#383;cribe, likewi&#383;e &#383;ecretary to the <cdpbt>king of Paterdale</cdpbt>. This latter appellation induced me to enquire who this great per&#383;onage was; when they gave me a &#383;hort hi&#383;tory of his very extraordinary 

<pb n="77" />

character: That he was an old man about four&#383;core, of the name of <cdperson>Moi&#383;ey</cdperson>, owner of the principal hou&#383;e in that village, called <cdplace>Paterdale-hou&#383;e</cdplace>, who po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed near one thou&#383;and per annum, yet lives the verie&#383;t wretch of the fraternity of mi&#383;ers. He accidentally pa&#383;&#383;ing by, during this conver&#383;ation, I was glad of the opportunity of paying my re&#383;pects to &#383;o noble a king; accordingly I approached with due reverence his venerable maje&#383;ty, and was permitted a &#383;hort conver&#383;ation, but could get little information from this audience, for the few incoherent &#383;entences with which I was favoured, gave me to under&#383;tand that his thoughts were more fixed upon his own intere&#383;t, and the accumulation of his wealth, than to &#383;atisfy the curio&#383;ity of a traveller. However, I was &#383;ufficiently gratified, for I had by this time well examined his princely dre&#383;s and figure. </p>

<pb n="78" />

<p>As to his face and form, they were &#383;uch as naturally await upon old age, but his common daily habit (for I will not &#383;uppo&#383;e the&#383;e his robes of &#383;tate) was &#383;uch as is rarely found in the mo&#383;t needy &#383;outhern cot; a filthy brown coat, who&#383;e cour&#383;e thread bare texture appeared to have &#383;tood the drudgery of more than twenty years, wai&#383;tcoat and breeches of near the &#383;ame de&#383;cription, his thick &#383;pun woollen ho&#383;e, that once were blue, but made for long duration, now bore but a faint re&#383;emblance of their former colour; and to pre&#383;erve his princely feet from the perils of the weather, he had on a large pair of clogs, who&#383;e ponderous &#383;oles mu&#383;t once have made havock, which he thought extravagant, into &#383;ome of his mo&#383;t favourite timber. Something like a hat indeed he wore, but whether underneath it, might be found the thin remains of &#383;ilver locks, or gri&#383;ly wig, I know not; for all was 

<pb n="79" />

concealed under the cover of a check wove handkerchief that tied clo&#383;e his fallen chin. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>But to return to the character of hone&#383;t Charon; his company now became more entertaining, and his genius began to di&#383;play it&#383;elf in various &#383;pecimens of poetry, nor was he ignorant of many other &#383;ubjects. In &#383;hort, &#383;o wrapt up was I, in the di&#383;covery of &#383;uch abilities in this remote place, that I could not depart without extremely regretting that &#383;uch a man &#383;hould be doomed to linger out his life upon the &#383;canty pittance of a few pounds a year. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>Pleas&apos;d with this unexpected entertainment, we now left this place to take &#383;ome further notice of the lake, and continued our ride about two miles lower, through the mo&#383;t delightful avenues imaginable, formed by the &#383;urrounding

<pb n="80" />

oaks that on one &#383;ide covered the margin of the lake; and on the other hung from the immen&#383;e cliffs above, which one would imagine not capable of producing any thing &#383;o rich and valuable. What renders the &#383;cene &#383;till more lovely is the &#383;moothne&#383;s and &#383;uperior excellence of the road. The bold promontaries here pu&#383;h them&#383;elves into the bo&#383;om of the water, forming &#383;lopes and bays of the greate&#383;t variety that can plea&#383;e the eye, and give grandeur to the &#383;cene; the&#383;e promontaries afford many admirable &#383;tations for ob&#383;erving the various reaches and windings of the mo&#383;t curious lake. Thence too, we had a very good view of the <cdpbt>Duke of Norfolk&apos;s</cdpbt> new place &#383;ituated on a fine &#383;lope of verdure under <cdplace>Airey-fells</cdplace>, about a mile below. With a gla&#383;s I could well di&#383;tingui&#383;h the form and &#383;tyle of building, which is oblong, with turrets at each end; but the &#383;cale not very large and not yet fini&#383;hed: the part

<pb n="81" />

towards the lake is now habitable, and the Duke re&#383;ides there frequently. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>Thus far &#383;atisfied with this day&apos;s excur&#383;ion we returned over the hills of <cdplace>Kirk&#383;ton</cdplace>, and took the right hand road thro&apos; <cdplace>Amble&#383;ide</cdplace>, to our Inn at <cdplace>Low-wood</cdplace>, where at night a cannon was di&#383;charged from the green adjoining the lake, for the purpo&#383;e of &#383;hewing the remarkable reverberations of &#383;ounds often produced among&#383;t the&#383;e rocks and vallies, but the air being unfavourable, and the wind not in a proper direction, our expectations were not &#383;ufficienly gratified. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>The next morning, Augu&#383;t 11th, being fair but cloudy, with &#383;hort intervals of &#383;un&#383;hine, we left this delightful place to enjoy &#383;ixteen miles of excellent mountain road to <cdplace>Ke&#383;wick</cdplace>, full of lakes and water-falls. At <cdplace>Rydal-Hall</cdplace> we

<pb n="82" />

were fir&#383;t called out of the road to admire two mo&#383;t beautiful ca&#383;cades, the one &#383;ituated a little di&#383;tance above the hou&#383;e, amid&#383;t a &#383;teep and thick wood, to which the owner, <cdperson>Sir Michael Fleming</cdperson>, much to his prai&#383;e, has formed a very agreeable winding path with convenient &#383;eats to accommodate the vi&#383;itors of the&#383;e romantic &#383;cenes. The water here makes fine falls, the uppermo&#383;t as &#383;een from the large white &#383;eat is a tumbling torrent from a con&#383;iderable perpendicular height, which di&#383;charges it&#383;elf with great violence into a capacious ba&#383;on of blacke&#383;t water, whence again it ru&#383;hes over the lower cliffs, in a manner which excites plea&#383;ure more than &#383;urprize. Thus gratified with the&#383;e charming effects of rock and water, we de&#383;cended to view the other ca&#383;cade, fir&#383;t di&#383;covered, and &#383;o much admired by <cdperson>Mr. Ma&#383;on</cdperson>; the &#383;ummer hou&#383;e window thro&apos;

<pb n="83" />

which it is beheld, renders the &#383;scene truly beautiful. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>From hence we pa&#383; &#383;ed by <cdplace>Rydal-water</cdplace>, a lake about a mile long; the rocks well wooded that &#383;urround it, and the various I&#383;les in miniature that peep above its &#383;urface, afford a pro&#383;pect truly plea&#383;ing. We next a&#383;cended a large eminence which throws the eye unexpectedly upon the beautiful vale and lake of <cdplace>Gra&#383;mere</cdplace>, &#383;o elegantly de&#383;cribed by <cdperson>Mr. Gray</cdperson>, where nothing &quot;breaks in upon the repo&#383;e of this little un&#383;u&#383;pected paradi&#383;e; but all is peace, ru&#383;ticity and happy poverty, in its neate&#383;t, mo&#383;t becoming attire.&quot; </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>A&#383;cending now the &#383;ummit of <cdplace>Dunmail-rai&#383;e</cdplace>, we took a farewel view of this prim&#230;val &#383;cene, and gradually de&#383;cending to the foot of lofty <cdplace>Helvellyn</cdplace>, had the wildly winding lake of <cdplace>Leather-water</cdplace>

<pb n="84" />

full upon our &#383;ight. This differs greatly from the re&#383;t, and it affords &#383;ome &#383;triking grandeur, after having ju&#383;t &#383;een the charming fertility that adorns the borders of <cdplace>Gra&#383;mere</cdplace>, to be thus pre&#383;ented with &#383;o much barrenne&#383;s of rude rock, broke into immen&#383;e gulphy bays and promontaries to receive this &#383;pacious water; the only object that affords a &#383;oft relief to the eye, amid&#383;t this rugged group, is the &#383;mall picture&#383;que bridge, leading over the narrowe&#383;t part into a penin&#383;ula of plea&#383;ing verdure. Hence we pa&#383; &#383;ed by a few cots thro&apos; the vale of <cdplace>Legberthwate</cdplace>, terminated by the bold craggy rock of <cdplace>St. John</cdplace>, beyond which winds its &#383;weet vale, &#383;urrounded by a numerous heap of fells and mountains. A&#383;cending now <cdplace>Naddle-fell</cdplace> to <cdplace>Ca&#383;tlerigg</cdplace>, we were &#383;uddenly charmed by the all-glorious vale of <cdplace>Ke&#383;wick</cdplace> and its enchanting environs. The <cdplace>Queen&apos;s Head</cdplace> was our Inn at this plea&#383;ant little town, 

<pb n="85" />

from whence, after dinner, we procured a guide and boat to &#383;ail upon the neighbouring lake, called <cdplace>Derwent-water</cdplace>, and vi&#383;it its various &#383;cenes and i&#383;les. But fir&#383;t, in&#383;tead of taking po&#383; &#383;e&#383; &#383;ion of <cdperson>We&#383;t&apos;s</cdperson> fir&#383;t &#383;tation, <cdplace>Cock&#383;hut-hill</cdplace>, which is now too much wooded for that purpo&#383;e, we went into the field in front of it, and had a plea&#383;ing general view of the lake, and its &#383;urrounding Amphitheatre of rude&#383;t rocks. We next went upon the water, but had not the plea&#383;ure to view its mirror-like &#383;urface, which it is &#383;o famous for in bright and &#383;erene weather, for now the clouds hung with threat&apos;ning rain above our heads, and the bleak winds con&#383;pired to give the watery plain an unplea&#383;ing agitation. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p><cdplace>Pocklington&apos;s I&#383;land</cdplace> was the next object of our notice: the length of which is about 251 yards, and breadth 169. The hou&#383;e in the centre of it is elegant, 

<pb n="86" />

tho&apos; not large, and is the property of <cdperson>John Pocklington, E&#383;q.</cdperson> who&#383;e rage for buildings, and fame for Regatta&apos;s amid&#383;t the&#383;e romantic &#383;cenes, are too well known to need any farther remarks. The remains of a Druid&apos;s temple at the &#383;outh end of the i&#383;land are worth ob&#383;ervation, tho&apos; its pre&#383;ent con&#383;truction con&#383;i&#383;ts only of a large circle of rude &#383;tones piled up of irregular heights, and is about 56 feet in diameter. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>From hence we cro&#383; &#383;ed to <cdplace>St. Herbert&apos;s I&#383;land</cdplace>, which is of an oval form, and filled with fir trees; here are &#383;till to be &#383;een the bare ruins of that &#383;aint&apos;s habitation. We next went to <cdplace>Lord&apos;s I&#383;land</cdplace>, which is al&#383;o &#383;trongly wooded, and di&#383;plays the &#383;cattered remains of a building formerly belonging to the <cdperson>Derwentwater family</cdperson>. </p>

<pb n="87" />

<p>We now returned to the &#383;hore again, and in our way to <cdplace>Ke&#383;wick</cdplace> pa&#383; &#383;ed over the borders of what was once <cdplace>Crow-park</cdplace>, but now no more the trace of groves remains: it is now a field of corn without a tree to deck its venerable brow. The charming views that are &#383;een from this &#383;pot are worthy the attention of the arti&#383;t who wi&#383;hes to give his land&#383;cape the &#383;oftne&#383;s of due proportion. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>The day following produced an abundance of rain, and fru&#383;trated every hope of vi&#383;iting the neighbouring country. But in the evening, which became more favourable, we &#383;tole the opportunity of riding towards the much admired vale of <cdplace>Borrowdale</cdplace>, and continuing on the left &#383;ide of the lake towards <cdplace>Grange</cdplace>, we came to a new edifice called <cdplace>A&#383;hne&#383;s</cdplace>, belonging to <cdperson>Mr. Pocklington</cdperson>, but not yet fini&#383;hed: behind this is a mo&#383;t rapid

<pb n="88" />

and delightful waterfall, which collecting it&#383;elf amid&#383;t the rude rocks above, ru&#383;hes with impetuous force into the craggy bo&#383;om of the wood below. On each &#383;ide are tolerable pa&#383; &#383;ages of a&#383;cent, which may afford a moderate view of its &#383;everal parts; but to have an adequate idea of this da&#383;hing torrent, it is nece&#383; &#383;ary to pur&#383;ue the arduous method of climbing up the &#383;lippery cliffs which compo&#383;e the prominent features of this wild &#383;cene. Here the thundering mu&#383;ic &#383;trikes with noble violence the a&#383;toni&#383;hed ear. From the&#383;e tremendous heights a &#383;ide view of the lake gives a pleasing indulgence to the eye. De&#383;cending, we now followed the common road, which &#383;oon brought us to the famed Lowdore, but the water here was not &#383;o full and violent, nor any one perpendicular fall equal to that we had ju&#383;t left, though the whole &#383;pace is con&#383;iderably higher. The acce&#383;s is dif-

<pb n="89" />

ficult, but as the &#383;tream was much le&#383;s than u&#383;ual, we were able to creep up from &#383;tone to &#383;tone near the top of this va&#383;t cha&#383;m formed between the rock of <cdplace>Shutteoerer</cdplace> and <cdplace>Gondar-crag</cdplace>. It is &#383;ituated at the &#383;outhern extremity of the lake, and affords many very magnificent views. But upon the broad &#383;ummit of one of the&#383;e highe&#383;t &#383;tones may be found a &#383;tation &#383;uperior to all others, and, I think, more advantageous for a complete exten&#383;ive pro&#383;pect than <cdperson>Mr. We&#383;t&apos;s</cdperson> fourth &#383;tation; for, I &#383;hould conceive, according to <cdperson>Mr. Gray&apos;s</cdperson> idea, that <cdplace>Ca&#383;tle-crag</cdplace> is too much elevated to pre&#383;erve a ju&#383;t proportion through the whole; but here, about half the height, the whole lake pre&#383;ents it&#383;elf uninterrupted by any object but its own beauteous i&#383;les, and gradually dimini&#383;hing, over the town of <cdplace>Ke&#383;wick</cdplace>, and village of <cdplace>Cro&#383;thwaite</cdplace>, the eye is carried thro&apos; a &#383;urprizing avenue, formed by lofty

<pb n="90" />

<cdplace>Skiddaw</cdplace> and its oppo&#383;ite mountains, and at length is lo&#383;t over the delightful vale in which the lake of <cdplace>Ba&#383;ingthwaite</cdplace> winds its woodgirt &#383;treams. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>Leaving this waterfall we extended our ride thro&apos; the rugged bowels of <cdplace>Borrowdale</cdplace>, which opens new &#383;cenes of horror and a&#383;toni&#383;hment. The road till lately was intercepted by the mouldering hand of time, and deva&#383;tations of ca&#383;ual &#383;torms or &#383;light convul&#383;ions. </p>

<p>Amid&#383;t the countle&#383;s ma&#383;s that every where pre&#383;ents it&#383;elf the famous <cdplace>Bowdar-&#383;tone</cdplace> is mo&#383;t con&#383;picuous, which is about 62 feet long, and 84 in circumference; but for a more accurate and enlarged de&#383;cription of this and other wonders peculiar to the place, vide page 95, &#38;c. of <cdperson>Mr. We&#383;t&apos;s</cdperson> tour. </p>

<p>We &#383;till continued by the village of <cdplace>Ro&#383;thwaite</cdplace> to the head of <cdplace>Borrowdale</cdplace>, 

<pb n="91" />

which gave us a &#383;ufficient &#383;pecimen of this rude di&#383;charge of nature, formed to impre&#383;s the mind with ideas of &#383;ublime contemplation, and to gratify the curio&#383;ity of the nice&#383;t ob&#383;erver. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>Next morning we propo&#383;ed a&#383;cending the immen&#383;e brow of unparalleled <cdplace>Skiddaw</cdplace>, but the lowering clouds veiling in thick mi&#383;ts much of his &#383;tupendous height, we were obliged to decline this plan, but adopted another more exten&#383;ive. Accordingly, with a living guide, <cdperson>Jo&#383;eph Hodg&#383;on</cdperson>, from the <cdplace>Queen&apos;s Head</cdplace>, we &#383;et out on a mountainous excur&#383;ion to the we&#383;t part of this country. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>In our way we called to view <cdperson>Mr. Gray&apos;s</cdperson> &#383;weet pa&#383;toral &#383;cene from the vicar&apos;s hor&#383;e block at <cdplace>Cro&#383;thwaite</cdplace>, which was very beautiful, but more &#383;o from the &#383;ide of the adjoining field, which

<pb n="92" />

takes in at the &#383;ame time a great part of <cdplace>Ba&#383;&#383;enthwaite water</cdplace> in the vale below. Having thus indulged our&#383;elves we continued about half a mile on the <cdplace>Cokermouth</cdplace> road, and then turned up a narrow lane to the left, which &#383;oon brought us to the foot of <cdplace>Swin&#383;ide</cdplace>; where leaving our hor&#383;es, we gained the &#383;ummit of this mountain, which commands the rich vale of <cdplace>Ke&#383;wick</cdplace>, and <cdplace>Ba&#383;&#383;enthwaite-water</cdplace> to the left, the town of <cdplace>Ke&#383;wick</cdplace> at the foot of <cdplace>Skiddaw</cdplace> in front, <cdplace>Derwent lake</cdplace> with the gorge of <cdplace>Borrow-dale</cdplace> to the right. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>Turning to the contrary a&#383;pect, the vale of <cdplace>Newlands</cdplace> with all its &#383;urrounding rocks and hills, pre&#383;ents a fre&#383;h and mo&#383;t charming view. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>On our de&#383;cent as we traver&#383;ed this picture&#383;que vale, the tran&#383;ition was quick and extraordinary, from the almo&#383;t

<pb n="93" />

numbing cold of winter to the &#383;erene warmth of &#383;pring, from the barren rock to the cultivated farm, till pa&#383; &#383;ing <cdplace>Ke&#383;kcadale</cdplace>, &#383;olitude and uncultivated nature again &#383;pread their &#383;olemn charms, to fill the mind with aweful contemplation. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>Following now the narrow path, called <cdplace>Newland-haw&#383;e</cdplace>, on the &#383;ide of many a barren hill, we were again &#383;uddenly pre&#383;ented with much verdure, particularly, the delightful mountains <cdplace>Witele&#383;s</cdplace>, and <cdplace>Witele&#383;s-pike</cdplace>, who&#383;e gra&#383; &#383;y &#383;urface was &#383;cattered over with &#383;uch a fleecy flock as is rarely found in plains of the greate&#383;t fertility. </p>

<gap desc="A blank space." />

<p>Soon after we came in &#383;ight of <cdplace>Buttermere</cdplace> a &#383;mall &#383;olitary village, &#383;ituated between the lakes of <cdplace>Buttermere</cdplace> and <cdplace>Cromackwater</cdplace>. In the front we had <cdplace>Burtne&#383;s-turn</cdplace>, where is a pond in the

<p>Cro&#383; &#383;ing the vale of <cdplace>Buttermere</cdplace> we entered a mo&#383;t intricate barren inclo&#383;ure, called <cdplace>Buttermere-&#383;cale</cdplace>, which, with the a&#383; &#383;i&#383;tance of our experienced guide, we pa&#383; &#383;ed with great difficulty. Here fa&#383;tening our hor&#383;es to &#383;ome rails, we walked about a quarter of a mile to the left, to view that &#383;urprizing phenomenon, called <cdplace>Scale-force</cdplace>, and of which no de&#383;cription

has yet been given. At the time we were in&#383;pecting this extraordinary cha&#383;m its fall of water was deficient more than half its u&#383;ual quantity, which gave us a better opportunity of examining every part. It is a wonderful &#383;eparation of the two rocks, about ten feet wide, and the perpendicular fall of the &#383;tream near 150 feet. The rocks are chiefly barren that &#383;urround it, but on its margin, as if more peculiarly to adorn this enchanting &#383;pot, hang in graceful order both the willow and the &#383;sh. Its moi&#383;t walls are covered by the &#383;oft hand of nature with every &#383;weet variety of mo&#383;s, herb, and flower, which form innumerable pictures, beyond the reach of art to imitate &#383;uch excellence. </p>

break, we came to an excellent &#383;tation, called <cdplace>Lingey-point</cdplace>, a bold promontary that well commands this lake throughout. In front, on the oppo&#383;ite margin, &#383;tands <cdplace>Randon-knot</cdplace>, remarkable for its orange-tinted &#383;urface, <cdplace>Gra&#383;mire-mount</cdplace> for its purple one, and <cdplace>Silver-&#383;ide</cdplace> for particular whitene&#383;s, which, when heightened by the rays of the &#383;un, form a mo&#383;t delightful group. All that is wanted to render this &#383;cene more perfect, is a revival of tho&#383;e fine woods, who&#383;e &#383;mall remains are left to bemoan the cruel effects of the American war. Proceeding onwards we came oppo&#383;ite the &#383;mall church of <cdplace>Lows-water</cdplace>, where, from a gentle eminence, appears a mo&#383;t beautiful view of that lake on the left, over which are faintly &#383;een, towering amid&#383;t the clouds, the <cdplace>Galloway hills</cdplace> in <cdplace>Scotland</cdplace>; and on the right the rich vale of <cdplace>Lorton</cdplace> opens a &#383;cene of fertility rarely to be found. </p>

<p>From this place, with the &#383;ure a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance of our guide, we undertook to traver&#383;e the we&#383;tern mountains to the lake of <cdplace>Ennerdale</cdplace>, about &#383;ix miles farther, and unnoticed by <cdperson>Mr. We&#383;t</cdperson>. After a laborious a&#383;cent up the &#383;teep &#383;ide of <cdplace>Ennikin</cdplace>, to the right of <cdplace>Mellbreak</cdplace>, we were rewarded with a grand exten&#383;ive pro&#383;pect of the <cdplace>Solway Firth</cdplace>, &#383;preading its wide waves into the <cdplace>Iri&#383;h Ocean</cdplace>. From hence too may be di&#383;tingui&#383;hed the <cdplace>I&#383;le of Man</cdplace>, and much of the mountainous country in <cdplace>Scotland</cdplace>, which, together with a &#383;ublime view of all tho&#383;e rocky hills we had left behind, could not fail to gratify our curio&#383;ity. After a few more rugged trials, &#383;ometimes upon the hard acce&#383;s of barren rocks, and at others upon the rotten &#383;urface of exten&#383;ive mo&#383; &#383;es, which threatened at every step a boggy cha&#383;m, we arrived at la&#383;t upon the firm brow of <cdplace>Floatren</cdplace>, which &#383;oon led us to the object of this

Of it&#383;elf, it con&#383;i&#383;ts of large barren rocks &#383;urrounding an oval ba&#383;on of water, about the &#383;ize of <cdplace>Gra&#383;mire</cdplace>, but on the right extends a plea&#383;ant vale, chiefly the property of <cdpbt>Lord Lon&#383;dale</cdpbt>, inter&#383;per&#383;ed with farms, &#383;mall woods, and a few mills for the manufacturing of paper, &#38;c. </p>

<p>The bold and craggy mountains that encompa&#383;s the head of this lake, are called by the natives, <cdplace>Hindas</cdplace>, <cdplace>Bowne&#383;s-Knot</cdplace>, <cdplace>Latterbarrow</cdplace>, and the <cdplace>three Coves</cdplace>, &#383;ituated betwixt this lake and <cdplace>Wa&#383;tdale Head</cdplace>, di&#383;tingui&#383;hed by the names of <cdplace>Birkmo&#383;s</cdplace>, <cdplace>Windlef</cdplace>, and <cdplace>Great Cove</cdplace>.
