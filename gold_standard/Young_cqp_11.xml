    <p>FROM <cdplace><i>Glenwelt</i></cdplace> to <cdplace><i>Brampton</i></cdplace>, I pa&#x222B;&#x222B;ed over &#x222B;ome moors of an excellent &#x222B;andy loam, and yet quite uncultivated. The inclo&#x222B;ed lands are good, lett from 10<i>s</i>. to 25<i>s</i>. <i> per </i> acre, farms from 10<i>l</i>. to 100<i>l</i>. </p>
    <p>At <cdplace><i>Carli&#x222B;le</i></cdplace> is a con&#x222B;iderable &#x222B;tampery of printed cottons, e&#x222B;tabli&#x222B;hed by &#x222B;ome manufacturers from <cdplace><i>Newca&#x222B;tle</i></cdplace>; the labourers in it earn from 1<i>s</i>. to 3<i>s</i>. a day. Al&#x222B;o a manufacture of checks, which employs many looms; the earnings from 1<i>s</i>. to 1<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. a day. </p>
    <p>Three miles to the &#x222B;outh of <cdplace><i>Carli&#x222B;le</i></cdplace>, land letts about 15<i>s</i>. an acre at an average. Farms from 20<i>l</i>. to 200<i>l</i>. a year. In as many more, they are not &#x222B;o large, from 30<i>l</i>. to 120<i>l</i>. and rents from 2<i>s</i>. to 20<i>s</i>. an acre. </p>
    <p>About <cdplace><i>High A&#x222B;cot</i></cdplace> the &#x222B;oil varies from a light loam and gravel to a clay, letts from 10<i>s</i>. to 20<i>s</i>. an acre. </p>

    <p>For wheat they plough three or four times, &#x222B;ow three bu&#x222B;hels and reap about twenty. For barley they plough twice, &#x222B;ow three bu&#x222B;hels, and reckon the average produce the &#x222B;ame as of wheat. They &#x222B;tir but once for oats, &#x222B;ow &#x222B;even bu&#x222B;hels and an half, and gain fifty in return. For pea&#x222B;e they likewi&#x222B;e plough but once, &#x222B;ow three bu&#x222B;hels, and gain at a medium fifteen. They &#x222B;tir twice or thrice for rye, &#x222B;ow three bu&#x222B;hels, generally in <i>February</i> or <i>March</i>, (a very remarkable time,) and reap twenty. They cultivate &#x222B;ome few turneps; plough three or four times for them; a few farmers hoe them: The medium value they reckon at 50<i>s</i>. an acre; and u&#x222B;e them for cattle and &#x222B;heep. Clover they &#x222B;ow with barley or oats, generally mow it for hay, and get about a ton at a mowing. </p>
    <pb n="119"/>
    <p>For potatoes they plough thrice, give the land a good coat of dung; chu&#x222B;e the drye&#x222B;t &#x222B;oils for them; and lay the &#x222B;lices in every other furrow, one foot from plant to plant. On coming up they plough between the rows, to de&#x222B;troy the weeds; a practi&#x222B;e one would &#x222B;uppo&#x222B;e &#x222B;ufficient to introduce a good turnep culture univer&#x222B;ally; for tho&#x222B;e who &#x222B;ee the effects of this operation on potatoes might &#x222B;urely extend the idea to turneps. -- They get 300 bu&#x222B;hels <i>per</i> acre, and &#x222B;ow rye after them. </p>
    <p>Good gra&#x222B;s letts at 20<i>s</i>. an acre; they apply it chiefly to dairying, and reckon that an acre and a half will feed a cow through the &#x222B;ummer; and an acre carry four &#x222B;heep: Very few of them manure their gra&#x222B;s. Their breed of cattle is the long horned, which they account much the be&#x222B;t. Their bea&#x222B;ts they fatten to about forty &#x222B;tone. </p>
    <p>The product of a cow they reckon at 50<i>s</i>. or 3<i>l</i>. that a middling one will give from two to four gallons of milk a day, and make from four to &#x222B;even pounds of butter a week. They have no notion of keeping hogs in con&#x222B;equence of cows; a dairy of twenty not maintaining above one or two. The winter food of their cows is<pb n="120"/>&#x222B;traw or hay, a ton and a half of which is the quantity they commonly &#x222B;uppo&#x222B;e a cow to eat in the winter; but if clover hay is u&#x222B;ed, one ton is enough. -- The &#x222B;ummer joi&#x222B;t is 25<i>s</i>. and that of winter 30<i>s</i>. and 35<i>s</i>. They reckon ten cows the bu&#x222B;ine&#x222B;s of a dairy maid. </p>
    <p>Their flocks of &#x222B;heep ri&#x222B;e from 20 to 120, and the profit they reckon at 6<i>s</i>. a head; lamb 5<i>s</i>. and wool 1<i>s</i>. They keep them the year round on the commons: -- The average weight of fleeces 4<i>lb</i>. </p>
    <p>In the management of their arable lands they reckon &#x222B;ix hor&#x222B;es nece&#x222B;&#x222B;ary for 100 acres of arable; they u&#x222B;e two in a plough, and do an acre a day. The annual expence of keeping hor&#x222B;es they reckon at 5<i>l</i>.  10<i>s</i>. or 6<i>l</i>. The joi&#x222B;t in &#x222B;ummer 40<i>s</i>. in winter 50<i>s</i>. They break up their &#x222B;tubbles for a fallow in <i>February</i>; plough &#x222B;ix inches deep: The price of ploughing 5<i>s</i>. an acre; and of a cart and hor&#x222B;e and driver 2<i>s</i>. or 3<i>s</i>. a day. They know nothing of cutting &#x222B;traw for chaff. </p>
    <p>Three hundred pounds they reckon nece&#x222B;&#x222B;ary for a man to &#x222B;tock a farm of 100<i>l</i>. a year. </p>

    <p>This is capital indeed! but very common; for much land, even within two or three miles of <cdplace><i>Penrith</i></cdplace>, hath been &#x222B;own every year with either barley, oats, or pea&#x222B;e, for the&#x222B;e &#x222B;eventy years. This information a&#x222B;tonished me; I inquired the produce on &#x222B;uch land, and found it reckoned as good, upon the whole, as other &#x222B;oils, managed upon more modern principles; five or &#x222B;ix for one of oats, and when wheat happens to be &#x222B;own, ten or eleven for one. Fallowing is a <i>new fa&#x222B;hion</i>, and not perfectly reli&#x222B;hed by the new farmers yet.</p>
    <p>In a common way they generally plough for wheat from three to &#x222B;ix times, &#x222B;ow two bu&#x222B;hels about <i>Michaelmas</i>, and gain, upon an average, about three quarters. For barley they plough from once to thrice, &#x222B;ow two bu&#x222B;hels and a half in <i>April</i> or <i>May</i>, and gain about 25. Sometimes barley is &#x222B;own on new broke up land, and the produce 50 bu&#x222B;hels. They give but one &#x222B;tirring for oats, &#x222B;ow four bu&#x222B;hels before barley &#x222B;owing, and get 28 in return. For pea&#x222B;e they give but one earth, &#x222B;ow two bu&#x222B;hels, and get in return about 16; generally u&#x222B;e the grey<pb n="127"/>rouncivals. They give from three to five ploughings for rye, &#x222B;ow two bu&#x222B;hels, the crop about 24.</p>
    <p>For turneps they give three or four earths, never hoe, and reckon the average value <i>per</i> acre at 50<i>s</i>. u&#x222B;e them for &#x222B;heep, and fatting of bea&#x222B;ts. Clover they &#x222B;ow with either barley or oats, generally mow it once, (three times have been known,) and get two ton of hay <i>per</i> mowing.</p>
    <p>They prepare for potatoes by ploughing twice or thrice; dung the land with long hor&#x222B;e dung; lay the &#x222B;etts in every other furrow, ten inches a&#x222B;under, and hand-hoe between them if weedy; &#x222B;ometimes they hor&#x222B;e-hoe them: If the land is de&#x222B;igned for wheat, they lime it about <i>Midsummer</i>, while the potatoes are growing. The crops ri&#x222B;e to 200 bu&#x222B;hels per acre, but the average about 120; price about 2 <i>s</i>. a bu&#x222B;hel.</p>
    <p>Lime is their principal manure, though but of a few years &#x222B;tanding: They lay 90 bu&#x222B;hels <i>per</i> acre on their arable lands; co&#x222B;ts them from 1 &#xBD; <i>d</i>. to 3<i>d</i>. <i>per</i> bu&#x222B;hel, be&#x222B;ides leading; they lay it on every fallow: They likewise u&#x222B;e it on their meadows, and find it to an&#x222B;wer well. But dung they reckon much better for everything.<pb n="128"/>They pare and burn a little, at the expence of 24 <i>s</i>. an acre. No folding &#x222B;heep, nor chopping &#x222B;tubbles. Stack their hay in buildings.</p>
    <p>Good gra&#x222B;s letts from 15<i>s</i>. to 20<i>s</i>. an acre: They u&#x222B;e it both for dairying and fatting bea&#x222B;ts; reckon that an acre will &#x222B;ummer feed a cow, or feed five &#x222B;heep. Their breed of cattle the long horned, which they think much the be&#x222B;t; their oxen they fat to about 40 &#x222B;tone.</p>
    <p>The product of a cow they calculate at 4<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. and generally have two firkins of butter from each: the medium quantiy <i>per</i> week about 7<i>lb</i>. but &#x222B;ometimes 14<i>lb</i>. <i>per</i> cow. Thet keep but few &#x222B;wine in proportion to their dairies, not above two to ten cows. The winter food is &#x222B;traw and hay; of the latter about a ton a head. They reckon a dairy maid can manage ten cows. 25 or 30<i>s</i>. the &#x222B;ummer joi&#x222B;t. In winter they keep them all in the hou&#x222B;e.</p>
    <p>They reckon 3<i>l</i>. the profit on &#x222B;ummer fatting a bea&#x222B;t of fifty &#x222B;tone. Swine fat from 50<i>s</i>. to 4<i>l</i>. 4<i>s</i>. a head.</p>
    <p>Their flocks of &#x222B;heep vary greatly; from 40 to 3000: The profit they reckon 5<i>s</i>. each; that is, lamb 4<i>s</i>. and wool 1<i>s</i>.<pb n="129"/>They feed them both winter and &#x222B;pring on the commons. The average of the fleeces 3<i>lb</i>.</p>
    <p>Thet reckon &#x222B;ix hor&#x222B;es nece&#x222B;&#x222B;ary for the management of 100 acres of arable land; u&#x222B;e two or four in a plough, as the &#x222B;oil is, and do three acres in two days. They account the expence of keeping a hor&#x222B;e at 6<i>l</i>. a year. The &#x222B;ummer joi&#x222B;t 2<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>.</p>
    <p>They do not begin to fallow till after the barley &#x222B;owing. The price <i>per</i> acre of ploughing 5<i>s</i>. and 5<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. and the common depth four inches.</p>
    <p>They know nothing of cutting &#x222B;traw for chaff. The hire of a one hor&#x222B;e cart 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a day.</p>
    <p>Three hundred pounds they a&#x222B;&#x222B;ert is a &#x222B;um &#x222B;ufficient for &#x222B;tocking a farm of 100<i>l</i>. a year.</p>

    <p>They plough twice for wheat, &#x222B;ow two bu&#x222B;hels and a half, about <i>Michaelmas</i>, and reap 35 to 40, upon an average. They al&#x222B;o &#x222B;tir twice for barley, &#x222B;ow &#x222B;ix bu&#x222B;hels in <i>April</i> or <i>May</i>, and reap 40 in return. For oats they &#x222B;tir but once, &#x222B;ow &#x222B;even bu&#x222B;hels, and gain 50. They have no beans, very few pea&#x222B;e, and as little rye. They &#x222B;tir three times for turneps, hoe them once or twice; the average value about 55<i>s</i>. u&#x222B;e them for feeding &#x222B;heep and &#x222B;tall-fatting oxen. They know but little of clover; one or two farmers have tried it with barley, but found it good for nothing: It mu&#x222B;t have been upon &#x222B;trange land.</p>
    <p>They have two ways of cultivating potatoes, by ploughing and digging: In the fir&#x222B;t, they &#x222B;tir three times, and dung the land well, lay the &#x222B;lices in every other furrow, one foot a&#x222B;under, and plough between them once while growing, be&#x222B;ides hand-weeding: They plough them up, and get 2, 3, and 400 bu&#x222B;hels <i>per</i> acre.</p>
    <p>Their other way is the lazy-bed method; they lay the dung on the green &#x222B;ward, the &#x222B;lices on that, then they dig trenches, and with the earth cover the<pb n="136"/>&#x222B;etts, but they reckon ploughing a better way.</p>
    <p>Good gra&#x222B;s land letts at 30<i>s</i>. an acre; u&#x222B;e it mostly for dairying; an acre and half they reckon &#x222B;ufficient for a cow, and an acre for four &#x222B;heep: Manuring it is common. Their breed of cattle is the long horned, and they reckon them be&#x222B;t: Fat their oxen to fifty &#x222B;tone; their &#x222B;wine to twenty-four, or thirty.</p>
    <p>The product of a cow they reckon at 3<i>l</i>. 13<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. and &#x222B;ix gallons <i>per</i> day a common quantity of milk <i>per</i> cow: Do not keep above one hog to ten. The winter food, &#x222B;traw and hay; of the latter they eat about two ton. The &#x222B;ummer joi&#x222B;t is 35<i>s</i>. In winter they are kept in the hou&#x222B;e: Their calves &#x222B;uck about two months.</p>
    <p>Their flocks ri&#x222B;e from 100 to 1000; the profit they reckon at 4<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. a head; that is, lamb 3<i>s</i>. and wool 1<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. &#x222B;ometimes 5<i>s</i>. They keep them, in both winter and &#x222B;pring, on the commons. The average weight of the fleeces, 4<i>lb</i>.</p>
    <p>In their tillage, they reckon that twelve hor&#x222B;es are nece&#x222B;&#x222B;ary for the management of 100 acres of arable land: They u&#x222B;e &#x222B;ome-<pb n="137"/>times four, and &#x222B;ometimes two in a plough, and do an acre a day with them. The annual expence of keeping a hor&#x222B;e they reckon at 6<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. the &#x222B;ummer joi&#x222B;t 2<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>.</p>
    <p>The price of ploughing, <i>per</i> acre, is from 5<i>s</i>. to 6<i>s</i>. and <i>March</i> the time of breaking up for a fallow. The hire of a cart and hor&#x222B;e 3<i>s</i>. a day.</p>

    <p>Now, Sir, for the glory of <cdplace><i>Keswick</i></cdplace>, -- its lake, &#x222B;o famous all over <cdplace><i>England</i></cdplace>. Let me fir&#x222B;t inform you, that it is by computation ten miles round, of an oblong figure, and inclo&#x222B;ed by a prodigious range of formidable mountains, of &#x222B;uch a height that they are cloud-topped for &#x222B;everal months in the year. The be&#x222B;t way of viewing it is to row round the lake, and land now and then for catching the varieties of the pro&#x222B;pect.</p>
    <note id="n1"> I &#x222B;hould apologize for many barbarous, and, probably, wrong &#x222B;pelt names, for they are taken from the people at <cdplace><i>Keswick</i></cdplace>. I have no where met with them in print.</note>
    <p>You walk from the town fir&#x222B;t down to <cdplace><i>Cock&#x222B;hut-hill</i></cdplace><ptr target="n1"/>, a &#x222B;mall ri&#x222B;ing ground, within the amphitheatre of mountains, and has been lately planted. The view of the lake from hence is very beautiful: You have a mo&#x222B;t elegant &#x222B;heet of water at your feet, of the<pb n="142"/>fine&#x222B;t colour imaginable, &#x222B;potted with i&#x222B;lands, of which you &#x222B;ee five, and are high enough to command the water around them. One is in the middle, of about five acres of gra&#x222B;s land, with a hou&#x222B;e under a clump of trees on one &#x222B;ide of it; the whole object beautifully picture&#x222B;que: You look al&#x222B;o upon another planted with <i>Scotch</i> firs; and al&#x222B;o upon three others more di&#x222B;tant. This is the view of the floor of this noble amphitheatre; the walls are in different &#x222B;tyle -- &#x222B;ublime. To the left you look fir&#x222B;t on a hilly rock, partly covered with &#x222B;hrubby wood; and further on, upon a chain of tremendous rocks, near 400 yards high; their feet are &#x222B;pread with hanging woods, but their heads bare, broken, and irregular. Following the line the lake &#x222B;eems to lo&#x222B;e it&#x222B;elf among a wood of rocks and mountains, the tops ri&#x222B;ing one above another in the wilde&#x222B;t manner imaginable: The oppo&#x222B;ite &#x222B;hore pre&#x222B;ents you a full view of a va&#x222B;t range of hills; and behind, you look upon the prince of the &#x222B;urrounding mountains, <cdplace><i>Skiddow</i></cdplace>, who&#x222B;e tremendous head rears above the clouds.</p>
    <p>Leaving this hill you walk down to your boat, and are &#x222B;truck with the limpid<pb n="143"/>tran&#x222B;parency of the water, which almo&#x222B;t exceeds belief; the bottom is quite paved with &#x222B;tones, and the white ones glitter through the tremulous curl of the &#x222B;urface like &#x222B;o many diamonds. You row to the left pa&#x222B;s, a variety of &#x222B;hore, here rocky and projecting, there low and retiring, coa&#x222B;t a planted i&#x222B;land, and coming under <cdplace><i>Wallow Crag</i></cdplace>, one of the immen&#x222B;e rocks before mentioned, you have from its foot a very fine view: The &#x222B;urrounding rocks and mountains are truly noble; the crag above you, fringed about a third of its height with pendent woods; the lake at your feet breaks beautifully into a bay behind a promontory, called <cdplace><i>Stable-hills</i></cdplace>; again&#x222B;t it is <cdplace><i>Bramp&#x222B;holm I&#x222B;land</i></cdplace><ptr target="n2"/>; and over the low part of the promontory you catch the wood on <cdplace><i>Lord's I&#x222B;land</i></cdplace>, in a very plea&#x222B;ing manner. The oppo&#x222B;ite &#x222B;hore is beautifully &#x222B;cattered with hanging woods, and &#x222B;ome white hou&#x222B;es give a liveline&#x222B;s to the view truly plea&#x222B;ing.</p>
    <note id="n2">Belonging to <cdplace><i>Greenwich</i> Ho&#x222B;pital</cdplace>.</note>
    <p>Taking your boat again, and rowing till you are oppo&#x222B;ite the opening between <cdplace><i>Wallow</i> and <i>Barrow Crags</i></cdplace>, the noi&#x222B;e of a <pb n="144"/>water-fall un&#x222B;een, will induce you to land again; walking on to a ruinous bridge, you look upon a romantic hollow of rocks and woods, with a &#x222B;tream pouring down the clefts in many &#x222B;heets, and &#x222B;een among the trees in the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que manner; a romantic &#x222B;cene of rock, and wood and water thirty feet high.</p>
    <p>Rowing from hence, under <cdplace><i>Barrow Crag</i></cdplace>, the &#x222B;hore is rocky, and various: Pa&#x222B;&#x222B;ing &#x222B;ome low ground, and landing on a ri&#x222B;ing one, the view is exqui&#x222B;ite. The water breaks in the mo&#x222B;t beautiful manner imaginable, into bays and &#x222B;heets, &#x222B;tretching away from the eye mo&#x222B;t gloriou&#x222B;ly, between the <cdplace><i>Stable Hills</i></cdplace>, <cdplace><i>Lord's I&#x222B;land</i></cdplace>, and <cdplace><i>Vicar's I&#x222B;land</i></cdplace>: <cdplace><i>Bramp&#x222B;holm</i></cdplace> cuts in the middle; and <cdplace><i>St. Alban's I&#x222B;le</i></cdplace> pre&#x222B;ents his broad &#x222B;ide to your full view. At the other end of the lake, the ri&#x222B;ing hills, part of cultivated, waving inclo&#x222B;ures, and part of hanging woods, all &#x222B;cattered with white hou&#x222B;es, and the whole crowned with the lofty mountains, are beautifully picture&#x222B;que, and contra&#x222B;t finely with the view of the &#x222B;outh end of the lake, around which the rocks and mountains are<pb n="145"/>tremendou&#x222B;ly bold, pendent, and threatening.</p>
    <p>Following the coa&#x222B;t, the &#x222B;hore is thinly fringed with wood; then you row around a projecting land, containing &#x222B;everal inclo&#x222B;ures, and come under a fine, thick, hanging wood, with a raging torrent breaking through it, over rocks, ju&#x222B;t &#x222B;een between the wood and <cdplace><i>Barrow-&#x222B;ide</i></cdplace>, but heard in the mo&#x222B;t romantic manner. -- You next anchor in a bay, the environs of which are dreadful; you are under a mon&#x222B;trous craggy rock, <cdplace><i>(Throng Crag,)</i></cdplace> &#x222B;cattered with &#x222B;hrubby wood to the very edge, and almo&#x222B;t perpendicular; and moving the eye from the formidable object, you find this end of the lake &#x222B;urrounded with a chain of them, in the bolde&#x222B;t and abrupte&#x222B;t &#x222B;tile imaginable. The oppo&#x222B;ite &#x222B;hore of mountains very great; and noi&#x222B;e of di&#x222B;tant water-falls heard mo&#x222B;t gloriou&#x222B;ly.</p>
    <p>From hence you coa&#x222B;t a dreadful &#x222B;hore of fragments, which time has broken from the towering rocks, many of them of a terrible &#x222B;ize; &#x222B;ome &#x222B;topped on the land by larger than them&#x222B;elves, and others rolled into the lake, through a path of de&#x222B;olation, &#x222B;weeping trees, hillocks, and every<pb n="146"/>thing to the water; the very idea of a &#x222B;mall &#x222B;hiver again&#x222B;t the boat &#x222B;trikes with horror.</p>
    <p>Advancing, you catch the view of a mo&#x222B;t beautiful water-fall, within the wave of a gentle bend of the rocks; but to enjoy the full luxuriance of this exqui&#x222B;ite land&#x222B;cape, it is nece&#x222B;&#x222B;ary to land and walk to an opening in the grove, from whence it is &#x222B;een in &#x222B;urprizing beauty.</p>
    <p>You look up a tremendous wall of rock, perpendicular to the top, &#x222B;cattered with wood, that &#x222B;eems to hang in the air; a large &#x222B;tream ru&#x222B;hes out of a cliff near the top, and falls, in the mo&#x222B;t broken and romantic manner, &#x222B;everal hundred feet: It falls in one gu&#x222B;h for &#x222B;everal yards; a projecting part of the rock breaks it then into three &#x222B;treams, which are pre&#x222B;ently quite lo&#x222B;t behind hanging woods. Lower down, you again catch it in a &#x222B;ingle bright &#x222B;heet, among the &#x222B;urrounding dark wood, in the mo&#x222B;t elegantly picture&#x222B;que manner that fancy ca conceive. Lo&#x222B;ing it&#x222B;elf again behind the intervening trees, it breaks to the view in various &#x222B;cattered &#x222B;treams, half &#x222B;een, glittering in the &#x222B;un beams, among the branches of the trees, in the mo&#x222B;t bewitching<gap desc="image of waterfall"/><pb n="147"/>colours of nature's clear ob&#x222B;cure. Lower &#x222B;till, you again catch it united in one bright ru&#x222B;hing fall, in the dark bo&#x222B;om of a fine hollow wood, which fini&#x222B;hes the &#x222B;cene. The &#x222B;urrounding hills, rocks, and &#x222B;cattered pendent woods, are all romantic and &#x222B;ublime, and tend nobly to &#x222B;et off this mo&#x222B;t exqui&#x222B;ite touch of rural elegance. In Plate I. is the &#x222B;ketch I took of it.</p>
    <p>Following the coa&#x222B;t you &#x222B;ail round a &#x222B;weet little i&#x222B;land, a clump of wood growing out of the lake; but it is joined to the main land when the water is very low. From hence, per&#x222B;uing the voyage, you come into the narrow part of the lake, and have a full view of mo&#x222B;t romantic terrible craggy rocks, inclo&#x222B;ing a mo&#x222B;t grand and beautiful ca&#x222B;cade: It is a view that mu&#x222B;t a&#x222B;toni&#x222B;h the &#x222B;pectator. You look up to two dreadful pointed rocks, of a va&#x222B;t height, which almo&#x222B;t hang over your head, partly &#x222B;cattered with &#x222B;hrubby wood, in the wilde&#x222B;t ta&#x222B;te of nature. Between them is a dreadful precipice of broken craggy rock, over which a raging torrent foams down in one va&#x222B;t &#x222B;heet of water, &#x222B;everal yards wide, ju&#x222B;t broken into ebullitions by the points of the rocks un&#x222B;een. At another <pb n="148"/>time I &#x222B;aw it, when the craggy rock appeared, and the &#x222B;tream was broken by it into &#x222B;everal gu&#x222B;hing torrents, which &#x222B;eemed to i&#x222B;&#x222B;ue di&#x222B;tinctly from clefts in the rock in the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que manner imaginable: The water is lo&#x222B;t in one &#x222B;pot, caught again in another; foaming out of this cleft with ru&#x222B;hing impetuo&#x222B;ity, and trickling down that with the mo&#x222B;t plea&#x222B;ing elegance. Nothing can be fancied more grand, more beautiful, or romantic.</p>
    <p>The &#x222B;ketch in Plate II. will give you but an imperfect idea of it.</p>
    <p>Taking a winding walk through the wood, it leads down to a rapid &#x222B;tream which you cro&#x222B;s, and presently come to a new and most delicious &#x222B;cene. To the right you catch a &#x222B;ide view of the fall ju&#x222B;t       de&#x222B;cribed, in a new direction, mo&#x222B;t beautifully embo&#x222B;omed in rock and hanging wood. Full in front you look upon another ca&#x222B;cade, which ru&#x222B;hes out as it were from the rotten &#x222B;tump of an old tree, and falling down an irregular &#x222B;urface of rock, it breaks into larger and more &#x222B;heets, &#x222B;ome full, others thin and trickling, a mo&#x222B;t &#x222B;weet variety: After this, it breaks again, and falls into<gap desc="image of waterfall"/><gap desc="image of waterfall"/><pb n="149"/>the &#x222B;tream in fre&#x222B;h beauty, elegantly romantic. Plate III. is the &#x222B;ketch I took.</p>
    <p>Following the &#x222B;hore into fleet water, you come into a region of mo&#x222B;t &#x222B;tupendous rocks, broken, and irregularly pointed, in the mo&#x222B;t abrupt and wild manner imaginable, with mon&#x222B;trous fragments, large as a hou&#x222B;e, that have tumbled from their heads -- Dreadful in the idea!</p>
    <p>Per&#x222B;uing the water to its point, you come into a new and mo&#x222B;t glorious amphitheatre of rocks and mountains; on one &#x222B;ide, craggy, broken, and wildly irregular; and on the other, a va&#x222B;t range of mountain &#x222B;ide. The hollow magnificently great.</p>
    <p>Going up the river to <cdplace><i>Grange</i> bridge</cdplace>, under <cdplace><i>Grange Crag</i></cdplace> the lake is lo&#x222B;t: the pro&#x222B;pect new and terrible; a whole &#x222B;weep of rocks, crags, mountains, and dreadful cha&#x222B;ms.</p>
    <p>Leaving the boat, and walking up to the village, you gain a view of a cone-like rocky woody hill, ri&#x222B;ing in the mid&#x222B;t of a hollow of mountains, mo&#x222B;t nobly romantic. From hence following the road to the lake under <i>Brandelow Hill</i>, you have the noble&#x222B;t view of rocks and hills in the world. <cdplace><i>Grange Crag</i></cdplace> and <cdplace><i>Crown Head</i></cdplace> appear in full view,<gap desc="image of waterfall"/><pb n="150"/>&#x222B;urrounded by an immen&#x222B;e wall of rock and mountain. The effect a&#x222B;toni&#x222B;hingly great.</p>
    <p>Taking boat again you row round a prodigious fine promontory, beautifully wooded; and upon turning it, you tack about round a most exqui&#x222B;ite little i&#x222B;land in the bay; and if the water is very high, there are two more very fine woody i&#x222B;lands, around which you may row: This little archipelago will entertain a per&#x222B;on of the lea&#x222B;t ta&#x222B;te. Nor is the view of the lake's environs unworthy of admiration. The crags and clifts to the right are tremendous: <cdplace><i>Skiddow</i></cdplace> fronts you in the &#x222B;ublime&#x222B;t &#x222B;tile; <cdplace><i>Saddle-back</i></cdplace> on one &#x222B;ide of him rears his head in the bolde&#x222B;t manner: To the left you look upon an exceeding fine hanging wood, beautifully &#x222B;pread over a waving hill.</p>
    <p>Advancing with the coa&#x222B;t you next land at the lead mines, which, if you have a ta&#x222B;te for grotto work, will entertain, as a boat may be loaded with &#x222B;par of various glittering and beautiful kinds. Here al&#x222B;o are two curio&#x222B;ities of an uncommon kind, <i>viz</i>. two &#x222B;alt &#x222B;prings.</p>
    <pb n="151"/>
    <p>Sailing along the &#x222B;hore it leads you under a noble hill mo&#x222B;t beautifully &#x222B;pread with wood; it is covered thick with young timber trees, which grow in the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que manner down to the very water's edge. You next enter a little bay, and look upon a mo&#x222B;t elegant &#x222B;mall round hill, covered with wood, inimitably beautiful. This you al&#x222B;o coa&#x222B;t, nor can any thing be more truly exqui&#x222B;ite than the&#x222B;e two &#x222B;lopes of wood, with beautiful inclo&#x222B;ures between them, contra&#x222B;ting the &#x222B;ublimity of the rocks and mountains in the noble&#x222B;t &#x222B;tile. Nor &#x222B;hould you here forget to remark three or four inclo&#x222B;ures on the other &#x222B;ide of the lake, down to the water's edge, under <cdplace><i>Achne&#x222B;s Fell</i></cdplace>; they are exqui&#x222B;ite.</p>
    <p>Sailing by &#x222B;ome very beautiful gra&#x222B;s inclo&#x222B;ures you catch a white hou&#x222B;e romantically &#x222B;ituated; and then &#x222B;kirting more inclo&#x222B;ures, turn round a &#x222B;mall but mo&#x222B;t exqui&#x222B;ite promontory, with a &#x222B;weet clump of trees on it: This leads into a very fine land locked bay, which commands a beautiful &#x222B;loping hanging wood; the &#x222B;cene enlivened by a white hou&#x222B;e quite in the &#x222B;pot of ta&#x222B;te. From hence you look over the lake upon <cdplace><i>Castle Head Crag</i></cdplace>, a fine round<pb n="152"/>of rocky wood ri&#x222B;ing out of a vale and backed with waving inclo&#x222B;ures.</p>
    <p>The &#x222B;hore from hence is mo&#x222B;t beautifully indented and irregular, running up among little hills finely fringed with wood: From hence you wind in and out of &#x222B;everal bays and creeks, commanding very picture&#x222B;que views of the land, and around a mo&#x222B;t noble hill of of &#x222B;hrubby wood covered to the very top. From hence around the town the &#x222B;hore is flat.</p>
    <p>Your next view of <cdplace><i>Keswick</i></cdplace> mu&#x222B;t be from land, by walking up the va&#x222B;t rocks and crags fir&#x222B;t de&#x222B;cribed. This is a journey which will terrify tho&#x222B;e who have been only u&#x222B;ed to flat countries. The walk to the highe&#x222B;t rock is a mile and a half up, and almost perpendicular, horribly rugged, and tremendous; it is rather a climbing crawl than a walk. The path cro&#x222B;&#x222B;ed the &#x222B;tream, which forms the fir&#x222B;t mentioned ca&#x222B;cade, in the mid&#x222B;t of dreadful cliffs and romantic hollows: The torrent roars beneath you, in &#x222B;ome places &#x222B;een, in others hid by rock and wood.</p>
    <p>From hence you climb through a &#x222B;lope of underwood to the edge of a precipice, from which you look down upon the lake<pb n="153"/>and i&#x222B;lands in a mo&#x222B;t beautiful manner; for coming at once upon them, after leaving a thick dark wood, the emotions of &#x222B;uprize and admiration are very great.</p>
    <p>Following the path, (if it may be &#x222B;o called) you pa&#x222B;s many romantic &#x222B;pots, and come to the projection of the hill, from which you look down, not only upon the lake as before, but al&#x222B;o upon a &#x222B;emi-circular vale of inclo&#x222B;ures, of a mo&#x222B;t beautiful verdure, which gives a fine curve into the lake: One of the fields is &#x222B;cattered over with trees, which from hence have the mo&#x222B;t truly picture&#x222B;que effect imaginable.</p>
    <p>Advancing further yet, you come to the head of <cdplace><i>Cra&#x222B;tig-fall</i></cdplace>, which is a va&#x222B;t opening among the&#x222B;e immen&#x222B;e rocky mountains, that lets in between them a view acro&#x222B;s the lake, catching two of the i&#x222B;lands, <i>&amp;c</i>. in a most beautiful manner; nor can anything be more horribly romantic than the adjoining ground where you command this &#x222B;weet view.</p>
    <p>At la&#x222B;t we gained the top of the crag, and from it the pro&#x222B;pect is truly noble; you look down upon the lake, &#x222B;potted with its i&#x222B;lands, &#x222B;o far below as to appear in another<pb n="154"/>region; the lower hills and rocks ri&#x222B;e mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;quely to the view. To the right you look down upon a beautiful vale of cultivated inclo&#x222B;ures, who&#x222B;e verdure is painting it&#x222B;elf. The town pre&#x222B;ents its &#x222B;cattered hou&#x222B;es, among woods and &#x222B;preading trees: Above it ri&#x222B;es <cdplace><i>Skiddow</i></cdplace>, cloud-topped in the mo&#x222B;t &#x222B;ublime magnitude.</p>
    <p>De&#x222B;cending to the town, we took our leave of this enchanting region of land&#x222B;cape, by &#x222B;caling the formidable walls of <cdplace><i>Skiddow</i></cdplace> him&#x222B;elf: It is five miles to the top, but the immen&#x222B;ity of the view fully repays for the labour of gaining it. You look upon the lake, which here appears no more than a little ba&#x222B;on, and its i&#x222B;lands but as &#x222B;o many &#x222B;pots; it is &#x222B;urrounded by a prodigious range of rocks and mountains, wild as the waves, &#x222B;ublimely romantic. The&#x222B;e dreadful &#x222B;weeps, the &#x222B;port of nature in the mo&#x222B;t violent of her moments, are the mo&#x222B;t &#x222B;triking objects &#x222B;een from <cdplace><i>Skiddow</i></cdplace>; but in mere extent the view is prodigious. You &#x222B;ee the hills in <cdplace><i>Scotland</i></cdplace> plainly; you view a fine reach of fen; command the <cdplace><i>I&#x222B;le of Man</i></cdplace>, and &#x222B;ee part of an object, which I take to be an highland in <cdplace><i>Ireland</i></cdplace>; be&#x222B;ides prodigious tracts of adjacent country.</p>
    <pb n="155"/>
    <p><cdplace><i>Keswick</i></cdplace>, upon the whole, contains a variety that cannot fail of a&#x222B;toni&#x222B;hing the &#x222B;pectator: The lake, the i&#x222B;lands, the hanging woods, the waving inclo&#x222B;ures, and the ca&#x222B;cades are all mo&#x222B;t &#x222B;uperlatively elegant and beautiful; while the rocks, clifts, crags, and mountains are equally terrifying and &#x222B;ublime. There cannot be a finer contra&#x222B;t. But it is much to be regretted that art does not yield more of her a&#x222B;&#x222B;i&#x222B;tance, not in decoration, for the lake wants it not, but in enabling the &#x222B;pectator to command, with greater ea&#x222B;e, the luxuriant beauties and &#x222B;triking views which to &#x222B;o many travellers are hitherto quite unknown: There are a va&#x222B;t many edges of precipices, bold projections of rock, pendent clifts, and wild romantic &#x222B;pots, which command the mo&#x222B;t delicious &#x222B;cenes, but which cannot be reached without the mo&#x222B;t perilous difficulty: To &#x222B;uch points of view, winding paths &#x222B;hould be cut in the rock, and re&#x222B;ting places made for the weary traveller: Many of the&#x222B;e paths mu&#x222B;t nece&#x222B;&#x222B;arily lead through the hanging woods, openings might be made to let in views of the lake, where the objects, &#x222B;uch as i&#x222B;lands, &amp;c. were peculiarly beautiful. At the bottom of the rocks <pb n="156"/>al&#x222B;o, &#x222B;omething of the &#x222B;ame nature &#x222B;hould be executed for the better viewing the romantic ca&#x222B;cades, which might be exhibited with a little art, in a variety that would a&#x222B;toni&#x222B;h.</p>
    <p>It is amu&#x222B;ing to think of the pains and expen&#x222B;e with which the environs of &#x222B;everal &#x222B;eats have been ornamented, to produce pretty &#x222B;cenes it is true, but how very far &#x222B;hort of the wonders that might here be held up to the eye in all the rich luxuriance of nature's painting. What are the effects of a <i>Louis</i>'s magnificence to the &#x222B;portive play of nature in the <cdplace>vale of <i>Keswick</i></cdplace>! How trifling the labours of art to the mere pranks of nature!</p>
    <p>Returning to <cdplace><i>Penrith</i></cdplace>, our next expedition was to <cdplace><i>Hulls Water</i></cdplace>, a very fine lake, about &#x222B;ix miles from that town: The approach to it is very beautiful; the mo&#x222B;t advantageous way of &#x222B;eeing it is to take the road up <cdplace><i>Dunmanlot Hill</i></cdplace>, for you ri&#x222B;e up a very beautiful planted hill, and &#x222B;ee nothing of the water till you gain the &#x222B;ummit, when the view is uncommonly beautiful. You look down at once upon one &#x222B;heet of the lake, which appears prodigiou&#x222B;ly fine. It is an oblong water, cut by i&#x222B;lands,<pb n="157"/>three miles long and a mile and a half broad in &#x222B;ome places, in others a mile. It is inclo&#x222B;ed within an amphitheatre of hills, in front at the end of the reach, projecting down to the water edge, but retiring from it on each &#x222B;ide, &#x222B;o as to leave a &#x222B;pace of cultivated inclo&#x222B;ures between the feet and the lake. The hedges that divide them are &#x222B;cattered with trees; and the fields of both gra&#x222B;s and corn, waving in beautiful &#x222B;lopes from the water, inter&#x222B;ected by hedges, in the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que manner.</p>
    <p>Upon the right, a bold &#x222B;welling hill of turf ri&#x222B;es with a fine air of grandeur. Another view from off this hill is on to a mountain's &#x222B;ide, which pre&#x222B;ents to the eye a &#x222B;welling &#x222B;lope of turf, and over it <cdplace><i>&#x222B;addleback</i></cdplace> ri&#x222B;es in a noble &#x222B;tile.</p>
    <p>Another view from this hill is down upon a beautiful vale of cultivated inclo&#x222B;ures; <cdperson>Mr. <i>Haffel</i>'s</cdperson> hou&#x222B;e at <cdplace><i>Delmaine</i></cdplace>, in one part, almo&#x222B;t encompa&#x222B;&#x222B;ed with a plantation: Here you likewi&#x222B;e catch &#x222B;ome meanders of the river, through the trees, and hear the roar of the water-fall. This hill is it&#x222B;elf a very fine object, viewed every way, but the &#x222B;implicity of its effect is de&#x222B;troyed, by being cut by a double &#x222B;tripe of<pb n="158"/><i>Scotch</i> firs acro&#x222B;s it, which varies the colour of the verdure, and con&#x222B;equently breaks the unity of the view.</p>
    <p>Another point of view from which this part of the lake is &#x222B;een to good advantage, is from off <cdplace><i>Soulby Fell</i></cdplace>: You look down upon the water, which &#x222B;preads very finely to the view, bounded to the right by the hills, which ri&#x222B;e from the very water; at the other, by <cdplace><i>Dunmanlot Hill</i></cdplace>; in front, by a fine range of inclo&#x222B;ures, ri&#x222B;ing mo&#x222B;t beautifully to the view, and the water's edge &#x222B;kirted by trees, in a mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que manner.</p>
    <p>Directing your cour&#x222B;e under the lake, and landing at <cdplace><i>Swarth Fell</i></cdplace>, the next bu&#x222B;ine&#x222B;s &#x222B;hould be to mount its height. The lake winds at your feet like a noble river; the oppo&#x222B;ite banks beautiful inclo&#x222B;ures, exqui&#x222B;itely fringed with trees; and &#x222B;ome little narrow &#x222B;lips, like promontories, jet into it with the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que effect imaginable; and at the &#x222B;ame time hear the noi&#x222B;e of a water-fall beneath, but un&#x222B;een.</p>
    <p>Taking boat again, and &#x222B;ailing with the cour&#x222B;e of the lake, you turn with its bend, and come into a very fine &#x222B;heet of water, which appears like a lake of it&#x222B;elf. It is <pb n="159"/>under <cdplace><i>Howtown</i></cdplace> and <cdplace><i>Hawling Fell</i></cdplace>. The environs here are very &#x222B;triking; cultivated inclo&#x222B;ures on one &#x222B;ide, crowned with the tops of hills; and on the other, a woody craggy hill down to the very water's edge. The effect fine.</p>
    <p>Next you double <cdplace><i>Hawling Fell</i></cdplace>, and come again into a new &#x222B;heet of water, under <cdplace><i>Martindale Fell</i></cdplace>, which is a prodigious fine hill, of a bold, abrupt form; and between that and <cdplace><i>Howling Fell</i></cdplace>, a little   ri&#x222B;ing wave of cultivated inclo&#x222B;ures, &#x222B;kirted with trees; the fields of the fine&#x222B;t verdure, and the picture&#x222B;que appearance of the whole mo&#x222B;t exqui&#x222B;itely plea&#x222B;ing. It is a mo&#x222B;t delicious &#x222B;pot, within an amphitheatre of rugged hills.</p>
    <p>Following the bend of the water under <cdplace><i>New Crag</i></cdplace>, the views are more romantic than in any part hitherto &#x222B;een. <cdplace><i>New Crag</i></cdplace>, to the right, rears a bold, abrupt head, in a stile truly &#x222B;ublime; and pa&#x222B;&#x222B;ing it a little, the oppo&#x222B;ite &#x222B;hore is very noble. <cdplace><i>Martindale Fell</i></cdplace> ri&#x222B;es &#x222B;teep from the water's edge, and pre&#x222B;ents a bold wall of mountain; really glorious. In front, the hills are craggy, broken, and irregular in &#x222B;hape (not height) like tho&#x222B;e of <cdplace><i>Keswick</i></cdplace>: They<pb n="160"/>project &#x222B;o boldly to the very water, that the outlet or wind of the water is &#x222B;hut by them from the eye. It &#x222B;eems inclo&#x222B;ed by a &#x222B;hore of &#x222B;teep hills and crags. From hence to the end of the lake, which there is &#x222B;prinkled by three or four &#x222B;mall i&#x222B;lands, the views are in the &#x222B;ame Stile, very wild and romantic. It is an exceedingly plea&#x222B;ing entertainment to &#x222B;ail about this fine lake, which is nineteen miles round, and pre&#x222B;ents to the eye &#x222B;everal very fine &#x222B;heets of water; and abounds, for another amu&#x222B;ement, with noble fi&#x222B;h; pike to 30<i>lb</i>. perch to 6<i>lb</i>. trout to 6<i>lb</i>. be&#x222B;ides many other &#x222B;orts. The water is of a mo&#x222B;t beautiful colour, and admirably tran&#x222B;parent.</p>
    <p>Returning to <cdplace><i>Penrith</i></cdplace>, I took the road to <cdplace><i>Shapp</i></cdplace>, by <cdplace><i>Lowther Hall</i></cdplace>, the &#x222B;eat of <cdperson>Sir <i>James Lowther</i></cdperson>, Bart. The house (it was burnt down not many years ago) is not &#x222B;o &#x222B;triking as the plantations, which are de&#x222B;igned with much ta&#x222B;te, and of very great extent. Near the road is the new town of <cdplace><i>Lowther</i></cdplace>, where <cdperson><i>Sir James</i></cdperson> is building a town to con&#x222B;i&#x222B;t of 300 hou&#x222B;es, for the u&#x222B;e of &#x222B;uch of his dome&#x222B;ticks, and other people, as are married: And it is highly worhty of remark, that he not<pb n="161"/>only encourages all to marry, but keeps them in his &#x222B;ervice <i>after</i> they have families: Every couple finds a re&#x222B;idence here, and an annual allowance of coals. This is a mo&#x222B;t incomparable method of advancing population, and con&#x222B;equently the good of the nation at large; nor can it be too much imitated. Above forty hou&#x222B;es are already erected.</p>
    <p>The &#x222B;oil about <cdplace><i>Shapp</i></cdplace> is generally a loam upon a lime-&#x222B;tone, in &#x222B;ome places thin, but in others deep; letts from 1<i>s</i>. to 20<i>s</i>. an acre; but the inclo&#x222B;ures generally 20<i>s</i>.</p>
    <p>Farms from 40<i>l</i>. to 400<i>l</i>. a year.</p>
    <p>Their cour&#x222B;e,</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>1. Break up, and &#x222B;ow oats</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2. Oats</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3. Barley</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4. Oats, and then down again.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>This is execrable.</p>
    <p>They plough but once for barley, &#x222B;ow two bu&#x222B;hels, and gain about twenty. For oats they give three or four ploughings, &#x222B;ow &#x222B;even bu&#x222B;hels and a half, and gain thirty-five in return.</p>
    <p>Good gra&#x222B;s letts at 20<i>s</i>. and 25<i>s</i>. an acre; it is u&#x222B;ed both for dairying and fatting,<pb n="162"/>but chiefly the latter: An acre they reckon will keep a cow through &#x222B;ummer, or &#x222B;ix &#x222B;heep. They manure it as much as they can, but that is no great matter. Their breed of cattle is the long-horned, and have fatted them &#x222B;o high as 130 &#x222B;tone, but very uncommon; 60 to 80 common.</p>
    <p>The product of a cow they reckon at 5<i>l</i>. and four gallons the common quantity of milk <i>per</i> day: As to &#x222B;wine, they keep none, upon account of cows: A farmer without a dairy has as many as tho&#x222B;e who keep the large&#x222B;t, which would &#x222B;urprize a <cdplace><i>Suffolk</i></cdplace> or an <cdplace><i>E&#x222B;&#x222B;ex</i></cdplace> man. The winter food of the cows is hay, in general, but &#x222B;ome &#x222B;traw. Their calves for the butcher &#x222B;uck from one to ten weeks; for rearing, not at all, but are all brought up by hand with milk, for twenty weeks. A cow, in winter, generally eats an acre and a half of hay, and they are kept in hou&#x222B;e. The &#x222B;ummer joi&#x222B;t from 14<i>s</i>. to 40<i>s</i>.</p>
    <p>Their flocks of &#x222B;heep ri&#x222B;e from 5 to 1500. They &#x222B;ell no lambs, but rear them for weathers, at from 7<i>s</i> to 14<i>s</i>. The profit, <i>per</i> head, of the flock, about 5<i>s</i>. Keep them, both winter and &#x222B;pring, on<pb n="163"/>the commons: The weight of the fleeces 3 or 4<i>lb</i>. at 3<i>d</i>.</p>
    <p>They u&#x222B;e two or three hor&#x222B;es in a plough, and do an acre a day. The &#x222B;ummer joi&#x222B;t of a hor&#x222B;e varies from 10<i>s</i>. to to 50<i>s</i>. The price of ploughing, from 5<i>s</i>. to 6<i>s</i>. an acre: They cut about five inches deep.</p>
    <p>They know nothing of cutting &#x222B;traw for chaff.</p>
    <p>They reckon 5 or 600<i>l</i>. nece&#x222B;&#x222B;ary to &#x222B;tock a farm of 100<i>l</i>. a year: They are, in general, grazing ones.</p>

    <p>I took the opportunity of being at <cdplace><i>Shapp</i></cdplace> to ride to <cdplace><i>Haws Water</i></cdplace>, a lake &#x222B;ome miles to the we&#x222B;tward. The road thither leads for &#x222B;ome di&#x222B;tance along the &#x222B;ide of a hill, which commands an exceeding fine view of <cdplace><i>Ponton Vale</i></cdplace> to the left. It is &#x222B;everal miles in length, of an oblong figure, all cut into inclo&#x222B;ures of a charming verdure, and &#x222B;cattered in the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que manner with<pb n="168"/>villages, clumps of wood, hou&#x222B;es, bridges, trees, &amp;c. A fine river takes the mo&#x222B;t beautiful &#x222B;erpentine cour&#x222B;e in the world through it: The oppo&#x222B;ite bank is a large ridge of mountain. It is a &#x222B;weet land&#x222B;cape, which brings to ones imagination the idea of an <i>Arcadian</i> paradi&#x222B;e.</p>
    <p>The approach to the lake is very picture&#x222B;que: You pa&#x222B;s between two high ridges of mountain, the banks finely &#x222B;pread with inclo&#x222B;ures; upon the right two &#x222B;mall beautiful hills, one of them covered with wood; they are mo&#x222B;t plea&#x222B;ingly elegant. The lake is a &#x222B;mall one, about three miles long, half a mile over in &#x222B;ome places, and a quarter in others; almost divided in the middle by a promontory of inclo&#x222B;ures, joining only by a &#x222B;treight; &#x222B;o that it con&#x222B;i&#x222B;ts of two &#x222B;heets of water. The upper end of it is fine, quite inclo&#x222B;ed with bold &#x222B;teep craggy rocks and mountains; and in the center of the end a few little inclo&#x222B;ures at their feet, waving upwards in a very beautiful manner. The fourth &#x222B;ide of the lake is a noble ridge of mountain, very bold and prominent down to the waters edge. They bulge out in the centre in a  fine bold pendent <pb n="169"/>broad head that is venerably magnificent: And the view of the fir&#x222B;t &#x222B;heet of the lake lo&#x222B;ing it&#x222B;elf into the &#x222B;econd among hills, rocks, woods, &amp;c. is picture&#x222B;que. The oppo&#x222B;ite &#x222B;hore con&#x222B;i&#x222B;ts of inclo&#x222B;ures, ri&#x222B;ing one above another, and crowned with craggy rocks.</p>
    <p>Twelve of the fifteen miles from <cdplace><i>Shapp</i></cdplace> to <cdplace><i>Kendal</i></cdplace> are a continued chain of mountainous moors, totally uncultivated; one dreary pro&#x222B;pect, that makes one melancholy to behold; for the &#x222B;oil it&#x222B;elf is highly capable of cultivation and of profitable u&#x222B;es; much of it is of a good depth; and the &#x222B;pontaneous growth proves that the nature of the land is equal to many valuable u&#x222B;es.</p>
    <p>After cro&#x222B;&#x222B;ing this dreary track, the fir&#x222B;t appearance of good country is mo&#x222B;t exqui&#x222B;itely fine; about three miles from <cdplace><i>Kendal</i></cdplace> you at once look down from off this de&#x222B;olate country upon one of the fine&#x222B;t land&#x222B;capes in the world; a noble range of fertile inclo&#x222B;ures, richly enameled with mo&#x222B;t beautiful verdure: And coming to the brow of the hill have a mo&#x222B;t elegantly picture&#x222B;que view of a variegated track of waving<pb n="170"/>inclo&#x222B;ures, &#x222B;preading over hills, and hanging to the eye in the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que and plea&#x222B;ing manner that fancy can conceive. Three hills in particular are overlooked, cut into inclo&#x222B;ures in a charming &#x222B;tile, of them&#x222B;elves forming a mo&#x222B;t elegant land&#x222B;cape, and worthy the imitation of tho&#x222B;e who would give the embelli&#x222B;hments of art to the &#x222B;implicity of nature.</p>
    <p><cdplace><i>Kendal</i></cdplace> is a well built and well paved town, plea&#x222B;antly &#x222B;ituated, in the mid&#x222B;t of the beautiful country ju&#x222B;t de&#x222B;cribed. It is famous for &#x222B;everal manufactories; the chief of which is that of knit &#x222B;tockings, employing near 5000 hands by computation. They reckon 120 wool-combers, each employing five &#x222B;pinners, and each &#x222B;pinner four of five knitters; if four, the amount is 2400; this is the full work, &#x222B;uppo&#x222B;ing them all to be indu&#x222B;trious; but the number is probably much greater. They make 550 dozen a week the year round, or 28,600 dozen annually: The price <i>per</i> pair is from 22<i>d</i>. to 6<i>s</i>. but in general from 22<i>d</i>. to 4<i>s</i>. &#x222B;ome boys at 10<i>d</i>. If we &#x222B;uppose the average 3<i>s</i>. or 36<i>s</i>. a dozen, the amount is 51,480<i>l</i>.</p>
    <pb n="171"/>
    <p>The wool they u&#x222B;e is chiefly <cdplace><i>Leice&#x222B;ter&#x222B;hire</i></cdplace>, <cdplace><i>Warwick&#x222B;hire</i></cdplace>, and <cdplace><i>Durham</i></cdplace>: They generally mix <cdplace><i>Leice&#x222B;ter&#x222B;hire</i></cdplace> and <cdplace><i>Durham</i></cdplace> together. The price 8<i>d</i>. 9<i>d</i>. and 10<i>d. per lb</i>. They &#x222B;end all the manufacture to <cdplace><i>London</i></cdplace> by land carriage, which is &#x222B;aid to be the longest, for broad wheel wagons, of any &#x222B;tage in <cdplace><i>England</i></cdplace>. The earnings of the manufacturers in this branch are as follow:</p>

    <p>All have con&#x222B;tant employment. During the war this manufacture was more bri&#x222B;k than ever, very dull after the peace, and has continued but indifferent ever &#x222B;ince.</p>
    <p>Their third branch of manufacture is the lin&#x222B;ey wool&#x222B;ey, made chiefly for home con&#x222B;umption, of <cdplace><i>Westmoreland</i></cdplace>, <cdplace><i>Lanca&#x222B;hire</i></cdplace>, and <cdplace><i>Cumberland</i></cdplace> wool; the hands are chiefly weavers and &#x222B;pinners.

    <p>The farmers and labourers &#x222B;pin their own wool, and bring the yarn to market every week: There are about 500 weavers employed, and from 1000 to 1300 &#x222B;pinners in town and country.

    <p>Their fourth manufacture is the tannery, which employs near 100 hands, who earn from 7<i>s</i>. to 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a week. They tan many hides from <cdplace><i>Ireland</i></cdplace>.</p>
    <p>They have likewi&#x222B;e a &#x222B;mall manufactory of cards, for carding cloth. Another al&#x222B;o of &#x222B;ilk: They receive the wa&#x222B;te &#x222B;ilk from <cdplace><i>London</i></cdplace>, boil it in soap, which they call &#x222B;cowering, then it is combed by women (there are about 30 or 40 of them) and &#x222B;pun, which article employs about 100 hands; after this it is doubled and dre&#x222B;&#x222B;ed, and &#x222B;ent back again to <cdplace><i>London</i></cdplace>.

All the poor in this country wear wooden shoes. A <i>Goo&#x222B;e-Gate</i> is the right of keeping a goo&#x222B;e on the common.</note>
    <p>From hence we viewed the famous lake called <cdplace><i>Winander Meer</i></cdplace>, ten miles we&#x222B;t of <cdplace><i>Kendal</i></cdplace>; by much the longest water of the kind in <cdplace><i>England</i></cdplace>. It is fifteen miles long, and from two miles to half a mile broad. It gives gentle bends, &#x222B;o as to pre&#x222B;ent to the eye &#x222B;everal noble &#x222B;heets of water; and is in many places beautifully &#x222B;cattered with<pb n="175"/>i&#x222B;lands: The &#x222B;hores are nobly varied, con&#x222B;i&#x222B;ting in &#x222B;ome places of fine ridges of hills, in others of craggy rocks; in &#x222B;ome of waving inclo&#x222B;ures, and in others of the fine&#x222B;t hanging woods; &#x222B;everal villages and one market town are &#x222B;ituated on its banks, and a ferry cro&#x222B;&#x222B;es it to another; there is &#x222B;ome bu&#x222B;ine&#x222B;s carried on upon it, &#x222B;o that it is not uncommon to &#x222B;ee barges with &#x222B;preading &#x222B;ails: All the&#x222B;e circum&#x222B;tances give it a very chearful appearance, at the &#x222B;ame time that they add to its beauty.</p>
    <p>I would advi&#x222B;e tho&#x222B;e who view this lake, not to take the common road down to the village of <cdplace><i>Bonus</i></cdplace><ptr target="n4"/>, where the boats are kept, but (for rea&#x222B;ons which I &#x222B;hall hereafter add) to go thither round almo&#x222B;t by the ferry. The landlord at the inn at that village keeps a boat, and can always provide rowers for any company that comes; the extreme beauty of the lake induced me to explore every part of it with attention; but as I <pb n="176"/>have already troubled you with &#x222B;everal recitals of the&#x222B;e water expeditions, I &#x222B;hall only mention a few of the principal points of view, and to which I &#x222B;hould particularly recommend any traveller to row if he had not time to view the whole lake; but no &#x222B;cheme of this sort can be more amu&#x222B;ing than two or three days &#x222B;pent here in rowing, &#x222B;ailing, fi&#x222B;hing, and wild duck &#x222B;hooting, all which are here to be had in great perfection; and I should add, that the end of <i>May</i>, or the beginning of <i>June</i>, is the proper time for &#x222B;uch an expedition.</p>
    <note id="n4">I am &#x222B;en&#x222B;ible throughout this Tour of mis-&#x222B;pelt names; but many of the places I mention are not to be found in maps, I am obliged, therefore, to write from the ear.</note>
    <p>Taking boat at the village, you row fir&#x222B;t to <cdplace><i>The I&#x222B;land</i></cdplace>, &#x222B;o called by way of preeminence, being by much the large&#x222B;t in the lake; it contains between thirty and forty acres of land, and I cannot but think it the &#x222B;weete&#x222B;t &#x222B;pot, and full of the greate&#x222B;t capabilities, of any forty acres in the king's dominions. The view from the &#x222B;outh end is very fine; the lake pre&#x222B;ents a mo&#x222B;t noble &#x222B;heet of water &#x222B;tretching away for &#x222B;everal miles, and bounded in front by di&#x222B;tant mountains; the &#x222B;hoars beautifully indented by promontories covered with wood, and<pb n="177"/>jetting into the water in the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que &#x222B;tile imaginable, particularly the ferry points on both &#x222B;ides; it is broke by <cdplace><i>Berk&#x222B;hire I&#x222B;land</i></cdplace>, almo&#x222B;t covered with wood, in another, and ju&#x222B;t hides a hou&#x222B;e on the main land.</p>
    <p>The ea&#x222B;tern &#x222B;hore is &#x222B;pread forth with the mo&#x222B;t beautiful variety. In &#x222B;ome places waving inclo&#x222B;ures of corn and gra&#x222B;s ri&#x222B;e one above another, and pre&#x222B;ent to the eye a &#x222B;cenery beyond the brighte&#x222B;t ideas of painting it&#x222B;elf. In others &#x222B;hrubby &#x222B;pots and pendent woods hang down to the very water's edge: In &#x222B;ome places the&#x222B;e woods are broke by a few &#x222B;mall gra&#x222B;s inclo&#x222B;ures of the &#x222B;weete&#x222B;t verdure; and in others run around large circuits of them, and, ri&#x222B;ing to the higher grounds, lo&#x222B;e them&#x222B;elves in the wilds above. Here you &#x222B;ee &#x222B;lips of land running into the lake, and covered with trees which &#x222B;eem to ri&#x222B;e from the water: There, a boldly indented &#x222B;hore, &#x222B;welling into fine bays, and &#x222B;kirted with &#x222B;preading trees, an edging as elegant as ever fancied by <i>Claud</i> him&#x222B;elf. The village is caught among &#x222B;ome &#x222B;cattered<pb n="178"/>trees, in a &#x222B;weet &#x222B;ituation, on the bank of a bay, formed by a promontory of wood, the back ground a &#x222B;weep of inclo&#x222B;ures, ri&#x222B;ing one above another.</p>
    <p>Following this line of &#x222B;hoar towards the north, you command <cdplace><i>Bannerig</i></cdplace> and <cdplace><i>Oare&#x222B;t Head</i></cdplace>>, two hills all cut into inclo&#x222B;ures to the very top; to the north you look upon a noble range of irregular mountains, which contra&#x222B;t finely with the other more beautiful &#x222B;hores. The we&#x222B;tern is a fine &#x222B;weep of craggy rocks, here and there fringed with wood. Advancing to the very farthe&#x222B;t point of land, the&#x222B;e objects are varied, and new ones appear that are truly beautiful. The <cdplace><i>Lanca&#x222B;hire</i></cdplace> ferry point and the woody i&#x222B;land join, and &#x222B;eem one prodigious fine promontory of wood; the ferry hou&#x222B;e &#x222B;een among the trees in a picture&#x222B;que manner. They form the boundary in front of a fine bay, walled in to the right by a noble rocky cliff; and in the middle of it a &#x222B;weet little woody i&#x222B;land. Over the low part of the promontory the di&#x222B;tant hills are &#x222B;een finely. The &#x222B;hore to the left, here, appears peculiarly beautiful, for half a dozen inclo&#x222B;ures of the mo&#x222B;t elegant verdure ri&#x222B;e from the water's edge among &#x222B;loping woods,<pb n="179"/>and offer a variety of colours of the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que hues. From hence likewi&#x222B;e you look back on <cdplace><i>Bannerig</i></cdplace>, a fine cultivated hill, ri&#x222B;ing from the lake in a mo&#x222B;t plea&#x222B;ing manner.</p>
    <p>Moving from this end of the i&#x222B;land along the we&#x222B;t coa&#x222B;t of it, the view is extremely picture&#x222B;que. The &#x222B;treight is broke by three i&#x222B;lands, two of them thickly covered with wood, the other a long &#x222B;lip, &#x222B;cattered with tall upright trees, through the &#x222B;tems of which, and under the thick &#x222B;hade of their &#x222B;preading tops, the water is &#x222B;een glittering with with the &#x222B;un beams; a land&#x222B;cape truly delicious.</p>
    <p>From the north end of this i&#x222B;le, &#x222B;o happy in the beauties of pro&#x222B;pect, the views are various, and &#x222B;ome of them exqui&#x222B;ite: Looking towards the &#x222B;outh, you command a prodigious fine view of the lake, &#x222B;preading to the right and left behind promontories, one beyond another, in a gloriou&#x222B;ly irregular &#x222B;heet of water, encircled by an amphitheatre of hills, in the noble&#x222B;t &#x222B;tile. To the north you look upon another &#x222B;heet, different from the fir&#x222B;t: It is broke by a clu&#x222B;ter of four &#x222B;mall but beautiful i&#x222B;lands.</p>
    <pb n="180"/>
    <p>Full in front you look upon a noble &#x222B;weep of mountains, and on one, in particular, that is very curious: It is of a circular form, ri&#x222B;ing out of a va&#x222B;t hollow among the re&#x222B;t, and is overtopped by them; romantic in the highe&#x222B;t degree. A little to the right of it, you command one of the mo&#x222B;t noble of cultivated hills. It is inter&#x222B;ected by hedges, trees, and &#x222B;cattered woods, into a va&#x222B;t &#x222B;weep of inclo&#x222B;ures, which reach the very top: A view beautifully magnificent. More to the right, the eye is delighted with the mo&#x222B;t elegant waves of cultivated inclo&#x222B;ures, that can be conceived, ri&#x222B;ing to the view in the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que varieties of land&#x222B;cape, and forcing admiration from the mo&#x222B;t ta&#x222B;tele&#x222B;s of mortals. To the left, a va&#x222B;t range of rocks and mountains form the boundary of the lake, and project into it in the bolde&#x222B;t manner.</p>
    <p>Sailing from this noble i&#x222B;land to that of <cdplace><i>Berk&#x222B;hire</i></cdplace>, a little hilly wood of &#x222B;cattered trees: The views are various, rich, and truly picture&#x222B;que: From the north &#x222B;ide of it you look upon a fine &#x222B;heet of water, to the <i>Great I&#x222B;land</i>, &amp;c. and bounded by a noble variety of &#x222B;hore. To the left, and <pb n="181"/>in front, high ridges of hlls and mountains: To the right, mo&#x222B;t beautiful waving hills of inclo&#x222B;ures; &#x222B;ome ju&#x222B;t ri4ing enough to &#x222B;hew their hedges di&#x222B;tinctly, and others hanging full to the eye; beneath, a boundary of rough hills, and wild, uncultivated ground. To the left, you &#x222B;ee <cdplace><i>Crow I&#x222B;land</i></cdplace>, which appears fine; and the ferry-hou&#x222B;e, beneath a clump of trees, on the point of a promontory, jetting into the water, with an effect really exqui&#x222B;ite. To the ea&#x222B;t, you look again&#x222B;t a very fine bank of inclo&#x222B;ures, mo&#x222B;t elegantly &#x222B;cattered with trees. To the &#x222B;outh, the lake is lo&#x222B;t between two promontories, projecting into it again&#x222B;t each other, and leaving a fine Strait between: One is high and rocky; the other, a line of waving wood and inclo&#x222B;ures, and catch beyond it the di&#x222B;tant hills, which complete the view. The we&#x222B;tern pro&#x222B;pect is on to a range of craggy hills; &#x222B;ome mo&#x222B;t beautifully fringed with hanging woods, and cut in the middle by a cultivated wave of inclo&#x222B;ures, broken by woods, hedges, clumps, and &#x222B;cattered trees, and ri&#x222B;ing one above another, in the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que irregularity that fancy can &#x222B;uppo&#x222B;e. At the top, a farm-hou&#x222B;e, under <pb n="182"/>a clump of trees; the whole forming a bird's eye land&#x222B;cape of the mo&#x222B;t delicious kind. Nor can any thing be finer than the hanging woods on this &#x222B;ide of the lake, broken by gra&#x222B;s inclo&#x222B;ures of a beautiful verdure.</p>
    <p>Sailing acro&#x222B;s the lake from <cdplace><i>Berk&#x222B;hire</i></cdplace> to the &#x222B;hore under the&#x222B;e inclo&#x222B;ures, which are called <cdplace><i>Round Table</i></cdplace>, nothing in nature can be more exqui&#x222B;ite than the view, as you move, of a fine, long, gra&#x222B;s inclo&#x222B;ure, at the water's edge, on the oppo&#x222B;ite &#x222B;hore, bounded by fine woods, except to the lake, edged with &#x222B;ome &#x222B;preading trees, through which the view of the gra&#x222B;s is truly picture&#x222B;que. Other waving &#x222B;lopes of inclo&#x222B;ures, to the right, hang to the lake, under the &#x222B;hade of a rough, wild hill, and down to a &#x222B;kirting of wood, on the water's edge, in the fine&#x222B;t manner. Behind, the rocky cliff of <cdplace><i>Fourne&#x222B;s Fells</i></cdplace>, has a noble appearance, crowned with a &#x222B;weep of wood.</p>
    <p>Sailing under the we&#x222B;tern &#x222B;hore, you command mo&#x222B;t beautiful land&#x222B;capes on the oppo&#x222B;ite one, con&#x222B;i&#x222B;ting of the fine&#x222B;t banks of cultivated inclo&#x222B;ures, &#x222B;cattered with trees, clumps of wood, farm hou&#x222B;es,<pb n="183"/>&amp;c. and hanging to the water's edge in the mo&#x222B;t charming variety of &#x222B;ituation; the fields in &#x222B;ome places dipping in the very lake, in others thick woods ri&#x222B;ing from the water; &#x222B;cenes which call for the pencil of a genius to catch graces from nature beyond the reach of the mo&#x222B;t elaborate art.</p>
    <p>Coming to <cdplace><i>Ling Holm</i></cdplace>, a &#x222B;mall rocky i&#x222B;land, with a few trees on it, you have a double view of the two &#x222B;hores, finely contra&#x222B;ted, the we&#x222B;tern &#x222B;pread with noble hanging woods; and the ea&#x222B;tern one cultivated hills, waving to the eye in the fine&#x222B;t inequalities of &#x222B;urface. The di&#x222B;tant hills are al&#x222B;o &#x222B;een in a bold &#x222B;tile over the low inclo&#x222B;ures of <cdplace><i>Rawlin&#x222B;on's Nab</i></cdplace>, a promontory to the &#x222B;outh.</p>
    <p>Landing on the point of that promontory the view is very noble, it commands two glorious &#x222B;heets of water, north and &#x222B;outh, each of four or five miles in length. That to the &#x222B;outh is bounded in general by rough woody hills, broken in a few &#x222B;pots by little inclo&#x222B;ures: In front of the promontory, &#x222B;everal very beautiful ones, cut by irregular &#x222B;weeps of wood, and hanging to the water's edge in the fine&#x222B;t manner; the whole crowned with craggy tops of hills.</p>
    <pb n="184"/>
    <p>But the view to the north is much the mo&#x222B;t beautiful. <cdplace><i>Berk&#x222B;hire I&#x222B;land</i></cdplace> breaks the &#x222B;heet of water in one place, and adds to the picture&#x222B;que variety of the &#x222B;cene without injuring its noble &#x222B;implicity. <cdplace><i>Common Nab</i></cdplace>, a promontory from the ea&#x222B;t &#x222B;hore, projects into it in another place, elegantly variegated with wood and inclo&#x222B;ures, waving over &#x222B;loping hills, and crowned with rough uncultivated ground. One inclo&#x222B;ure in paticular breaks into the wood in the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que manner imaginable. This end of the lake is bounded by the noble hills of cultivated inclo&#x222B;ures, already mentioned, which are viewed from hence to much advantage; they ri&#x222B;e from the &#x222B;hore with great magnificence. To the left a ridge of hanging woods, &#x222B;pread over wild romantic ground, that breaks into bold projections, abrupt and spirited, contra&#x222B;ting the elegance of the opposite beautiful &#x222B;hore in the fine&#x222B;t manner.</p>
    <p>Having thus viewed the mo&#x222B;t plea&#x222B;ing objects from the&#x222B;e points, let me next conduct you to a &#x222B;pot, where, at one glance, you command them all, in fre&#x222B;h &#x222B;ituations, and all a&#x222B;&#x222B;uming a new appearance. For this purpo&#x222B;e you return to the village, and<pb n="185"/>taking the bye road to the turnpike, (not that by which you came) mount the hill without turning your head (if I was your guide I would conduct you behind a &#x222B;mall hill, that you might come at once upon the view) till you almo&#x222B;t gain the top, when you will be &#x222B;truck with a&#x222B;toni&#x222B;hment at the pro&#x222B;pect &#x222B;pread forth at your feet, which, if not the mo&#x222B;t &#x222B;uperlative view that nature can exhibit, &#x222B;he is more fertile in beauties than the reach of my imagination will allow me to conceive. It would be mere vanity to attempt to de&#x222B;cribe a &#x222B;cene which beggars all de&#x222B;cription, but that you may have &#x222B;ome faint idea of the outlines of this wonderful picture, I will ju&#x222B;t give the particulars of which it con&#x222B;i&#x222B;ts.</p>
    <p>The point on which you &#x222B;tand is the &#x222B;ide of a large ridge of hills that form the ea&#x222B;tern boundaries of the lake, and the &#x222B;ituation high enough to look <i>down</i> upon all the objects: A circum&#x222B;tance of great importance, and which painting cannot imitate: In land&#x222B;capes, you are either on a level with the objects, or look <i>up</i> to them; the painter cannot give the declivity at your feet, which le&#x222B;&#x222B;ens the objects as much in the perpendicular line as in his horizontal one.</p>
    <pb n="186"/>
    <p>You look down upon a noble winding valley of about twelve miles long, every where inclo&#x222B;ed with grounds which ri&#x222B;e in a very bold and various manner; in &#x222B;ome places bulging into mountains, abrupt, wild, and uncultivated; in others, breaking into rocks, craggy, pointed, and irregular: Here, ri&#x222B;ing into hills covered with the noble&#x222B;t woods, pre&#x222B;enting a gloomy brownne&#x222B;s of &#x222B;hade, almo&#x222B;t from the clouds to the reflection of the trees in the limpid water they &#x222B;o beautifully &#x222B;kirt: There, waving in glorious &#x222B;lopes of cultivated inclo&#x222B;ures, adorned in the &#x222B;weete&#x222B;t manner with every object that can give variety to art, or elegance to nature; trees, woods, villages, hou&#x222B;es, farms, &#x222B;cattered with picture&#x222B;que confu&#x222B;ion, and waving to the eye in the mo&#x222B;t romantic land&#x222B;capes that nature can exhibit.</p>
    <p>This valley, &#x222B;o beautifully inclo&#x222B;ed, is floated by the lake, which &#x222B;preads forth to the right and left in one va&#x222B;t but irregular expan&#x222B;e of tran&#x222B;parent water. A more noble object can hardly be imagined. Its immediate &#x222B;hoar is traced in every variety of line that fancy can imagine, &#x222B;ometimes contracting the lake into the appearance of<pb n="187"/> a noble winding river; at others retiring from it, and opening large &#x222B;welling bays, as if for navies to anchor in; promontories &#x222B;pread with woods, or &#x222B;cattered with trees and inclo&#x222B;ures, projecting into the water in the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que &#x222B;tile imaginable: rocky points breaking the &#x222B;hore, and rearing their bold heads above the water. In a word, a variety that amazes the beholder.</p>
    <p>But what fini&#x222B;hes the &#x222B;cene with an elegance too delicious to be imagined, is, this beautiful &#x222B;heet of water being dotted with no le&#x222B;s than ten i&#x222B;lands, di&#x222B;tinctly commanded by the eye; all of the mo&#x222B;t bewitching beauty. The large one pre&#x222B;ents a waving various line, which ri&#x222B;es from the water in the mo&#x222B;t picture&#x222B;que inequalities of &#x222B;urface: high land in one place, low in another; clumps of trees in this &#x222B;pot, &#x222B;cattered ones in that; adorned by a farmhou&#x222B;e on the water's edge, and backed with a little wood, vyeing in &#x222B;imple elegance with <i>Boromean</i> palaces: Some of the &#x222B;maller i&#x222B;les ri&#x222B;ing from the lake like little hills of wood, &#x222B;ome only &#x222B;cattered with trees, and others of gra&#x222B;s of the fine&#x222B;t verdure; a more beautiful variety no where to be &#x222B;een.</p>
    <pb n="188"/>
    <p>Strain your imagination to command the idea of &#x222B;o noble an expan&#x222B;e of water thus gloriou&#x222B;ly environed; &#x222B;potted with i&#x222B;lands more beautiful than would have i&#x222B;&#x222B;ued from the pencil of the happie&#x222B;t painter. Picture the mountains rearing their maje&#x222B;tic heads with native &#x222B;ublimity; the va&#x222B;t rocks boldly projecting their terrible craggy points: And in the path of beauty, the variegated inclo&#x222B;ures of the mo&#x222B;t charming verdure, hanging to the eye in every picture&#x222B;que form that can grace a land&#x222B;cape, with the mo&#x222B;t exqui&#x222B;ite touches of <i>la belle nature</i>: If you rai&#x222B;e your fancy to &#x222B;omething infinitely beyond this a&#x222B;&#x222B;emblage of rural elegancies, you may have a faint notion of the unexampled beauties of this ravi&#x222B;hing land&#x222B;cape.</p>
    <p>As I next re&#x222B;ume intelligence of hu&#x222B;bandry with the county of <cdplace><i>Lanca&#x222B;ter</i></cdplace>, I &#x222B;hall here conclude this letter,</p>

    <p>RETURNING to <cdplace><i>Kendal</i></cdplace> I took the road to <cdplace><i>Burton</i></cdplace>, pa&#x222B;&#x222B;ing through a country various in re&#x222B;pect of culture: Around that town, particularly about <cdplace><i>Holme</i></cdplace>, their &#x222B;oil is a light loam on a lime &#x222B;tone, with &#x222B;ome of &#x222B;and, letts from 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. to 3<i>l</i>. an acre; average about a guinea.</p>
    <p>Farms from 20<i>l</i>. to 80<i>l</i>. a year.</p>
    <p>As to their cour&#x222B;es they did not u&#x222B;e to fallow at all, but now they are,</p>

    <p>Of wheat they &#x222B;ow two bu&#x222B;hels, about <i>Michaelmas</i>, and reap from twelve to fifteen. For barley they plough twice, &#x222B;ow not quite three bu&#x222B;hels, about the end of <i>April</i> or the beginning of <i>May</i>, and reckon the average produce at twenty. They plough but once for oats, &#x222B;ow four bu&#x222B;hels about the time of barley &#x222B;owing; the crop twenty-four. They cultivate &#x222B;ome beans, plough once, &#x222B;ow two bu&#x222B;hels in <i>March</i> or <i>April</i>, never hoe, but gain on an average twenty-three bu&#x222B;hels. They plough once for pea&#x222B;e, &#x222B;ow a bu&#x222B;hel and a half, and gain from none at all to fifteen bu&#x222B;hels. For rye they likewi&#x222B;e give but one earth, &#x222B;ow two bu&#x222B;hels; the crop from twelve to fifteen.</p>
    <p>They &#x222B;tir twice for turneps, know nothing of hoeing; the average value <i>per</i> acre, 5<i>l</i>. or 6<i>l.</i> <cdperson><i>Thomas Richard&#x222B;on</i></cdperson> has had crops that he would not take 12<i>l</i>. an acre for; but &#x222B;uch extravagant prices are not in the lea&#x222B;t owing to good hu&#x222B;bandry, but the &#x222B;carcity of the commodity. They u&#x222B;e them for cows, &#x222B;heep, <i>&amp;c. &amp;c.</i> Clover is not very common, but they &#x222B;ow it<pb n="191"/>with barley; they get 15 <i>Cwt</i>. of hay off it the fir&#x222B;t crop, and 10 or 12 <i>Cwt</i>. the &#x222B;econd; but &#x222B;ometimes they feed one crop.</p>
    <p>Their culture of potatoes is as follows: They dung the lay ground well; lay the &#x222B;lices (18 bu&#x222B;hels) on the dung, and then dig trenches two &#x222B;pits wide, and cover the &#x222B;etts, which are laid &#x222B;even inches &#x222B;quare, with the turfs and moulds that ri&#x222B;e: If weeds come they are drawn out by hand. The crop, upon an average, 180 bu&#x222B;hels <i>per</i> acre. Barley they &#x222B;ow after them, and get thirty bu&#x222B;hels an acre. This is the lazy-bed way.</p>
    <p>As to manure, they can at pre&#x222B;ent boa&#x222B;t a little, for lime is in u&#x222B;e among them, but it has been only for two or three years; they lay 90 or 100 bu&#x222B;hels an acre on to fallow for wheat, co&#x222B;ts 4&#xBD;<i>d. per</i> bu&#x222B;hel; they do not pare and burn; &#x222B;tack their hay in hou&#x222B;es, but know nothing of chopping their &#x222B;tubbles.</p>
    <p>Good gra&#x222B;s letts from 2<i>l</i>. to 3<i>l</i>. They u&#x222B;e it chiefly for the dairy: An acre and a quarter, or an acre and a half, they reckon &#x222B;ufficient for the &#x222B;ummer feed of a cow; and an acre to keep four or five &#x222B;heep. Their breed of cattle is the long horned.</p>
    <pb n="192"/>
    <p>The product of a cow, 6<i>l</i>. 6<i>s</i>. to 7<i>l</i>. They give four gallons of milk <i>per</i> day, on an average. To ten cows, they keep two or three &#x222B;wine. The winter food hay and &#x222B;traw; of the fir&#x222B;t, about an acre and half. The &#x222B;ummer joi&#x222B;t, 35<i>s</i>. A dairy-maid, they reckon, can take care of eight cows; calves &#x222B;uck from from five to &#x222B;ix weeks, both for rearing and butcher.</p>
    <p>Sheep they reckon, I know not for what rea&#x222B;on, hurtful among milch cows; their flocks are from twenty to one hundred and fifty, the profit 5<i>s</i>. or 6<i>s. per</i> &#x222B;heep; keep them all the year in the field; the medium of their fleeces 6 or 7<i>lb</i>. from 3<i>d</i>. to 5<i>d. per ib</i>.</p>
    <p>In the tillage of their lands they reckon four hor&#x222B;es nece&#x222B;&#x222B;ary for fifty acres of arable land, u&#x222B;e three or four in a plough, and do three rood a day. The annual expence of keeping a hor&#x222B;e they reckon 6<i>l</i>. They break up their &#x222B;tubbles for a fallow in <i>March</i>; plough in general about five or &#x222B;ix inches deep; the common price 8<i>s</i>. an acre.</p>
    <p>Two &#x222B;hillings a day the hire of a cart and hor&#x222B;e.</p>
    <pb n="193"/>
    <p>One hundred pounds they reckon &#x222B;ufficient for &#x222B;tocking a farm of 50<i>l</i>. a year.</p>
    <p>Tythes are generally taken in kind.</p>
    <p>Poor rates 3<i>d</i>. in the pound; they &#x222B;pin flax and wool. Most of them drink tea twice a day.</p>
    <p>E&#x222B;tates are either large, or under 100<i>l</i>. a year: Very few gentlemen of 2, 3, 4, or 500<i>l</i>. a year.</p>
    <p>The farmers do not carry their corn above three miles.</p>
    <p>The following &#x222B;ketches of farms will give an idea of their general economy.</p>
