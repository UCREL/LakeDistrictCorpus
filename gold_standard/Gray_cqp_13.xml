<p>To <person met="U">Dr. Thomas Wharton</person></p>
  <!--Thomas Gray's letter, dated 30 September 1769, actually covers the days 30 September and 1 October 1769. In order to facilitate the GIS mapping of Gray's account of his tour of the Lake District, it is necessary to impose a more logical structure on his epistolary text. See Zoe Bolton's note for more on the complex textual history of Thomas Gray's account of his visit to the Lake District in October 1769, including Dr Thomas Wharton's role as addressee. In a letter to his Cambridge friend, James Brown, dated 10 October 1769 and sent from Lancaster, Gray provides a brief summary of his tour of the Lakes: 'I set out on the 29th September, with poor Doctor Wharton, and lay at Brough, but he was seized with a fit of the asthma the same night, and obliged in the morning to return home. I went by Penrith to Keswick, and passed six days there lap'd in Elysium; then came slowly by Ambleside to Kendal, and this day arrived here [Lancaster]. I am now projecting to strike across the hills into Yorkshire, by Settle, and so get to Mason's; then, after a few days, I shall move gently towards Cambridge.' As Bolton explains in her textual note, Gray's 'Journal' begins life as a series of letters to his friend, Wharton, who was unable to take part in the excursion around the Lakes.

<p> Oct: I. Wd <!--Gray uses a superscript 'd' when using the abbreviated form of 'wind'.--> at S:W: a grey autumnal day, air perfectly calm &amp; gentle. went to see <i>Ulz-water</i><!--<cdplace visited="Y">Ullswater</cdplace>--> 5 miles distant. soon left the Keswick-road<!--An example of Gray's use of well-delineated routes through the Cumbrian landscape.--> &amp; turned to the left thro' shady lanes along the Vale of <i><cdplace visited="Y">Eeman</cdplace></i><!--Eamont valley-->, which<!--again, Gray uses the abbreviated form of 'w' and 'ch' in superscript.--> runs rapidly on near the way, ripling over the stones. to the right is <i>Delmaine</i><!--<cdplace visited="U">Dalemain</cdplace>-->, a large fabrick of pale red stone with 9 windows in front &amp; 7 on the side built by <person met="N">Mr Hassell</person><!--modernisation of Gray's spelling-->, behind it a fine lawn surrounded by woods &amp; a long rocky eminence rising over them. a clear &amp; brisk rivulet <!--<cdplace visited="U">Dacre Beck</cdplace>--> runs by the house to join the <cdplace visited="N">Eeman</cdplace><!--River Eamont-->, whose course is in sight &amp; at a small distance.</p>

<p>Farther on appears <i><cdplace visited="N">Hatton St John</cdplace></i><!--Hutton St. John-->, a castle-like old mansion of <person met="N">Mr Huddleston</person>. approached <i><cdplace visited="N">Dunmallert</cdplace></i><!--Dunmallard Hill-->, a fine pointed hill cover'd with wood planted by old <person met="N">Mr Hassle</person> beforemention'd, who lives always at home &amp; delights in planting. walk'd over a spungy meadow or two &amp; began to mount this hill thro' a broad &amp; strait green alley among the trees, &amp; with some toil gain'd the summit <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Dunmallert</cdplace>-->. from hence saw the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="N">Ullswater</cdplace>--> opening directly at my feet majestic in its calmness<!--modernisation of Gray's spelling-->, clear &amp; smooth as a blew mirror with winding shores &amp; low points of land cover'd with green inclosures, white farm-houses looking out among the trees, &amp; cattle feeding. the water is almost every where border'd with cultivated lands gently sloping upwards till they reach the feet of the mountains, which<!--modernisation of Gray's spelling--> rise very rude &amp; aweful with their broken tops on either hand. directly in front at better than 3 mile's distance, <i><cdplace visited="N">Place-Fell</cdplace></i>, one of the bravest among them, pushes its bold broad breast into the midst of the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="N">Ullswater</cdplace>--> &amp; forces it to alter it's course, forming first a large bay to the left &amp; then bending to the right.</p>

<p>I descended <i><cdplace visited="Y">Dunmallert</cdplace></i> again by a side avenue, that was only not perpendicular, &amp; came to <i><cdplace visited="Y">Barton-bridge</cdplace></i><!--Barton Bridge - in his letter to Wharton Gray italicises Barton but not Bridge--> over the <i><cdplace visited="Y">Eeman</cdplace></i> <!--River Eamont-->, then walking thro' a path in the wood <!--<cdplace visited="Y">??</cdplace>--> round the bottom of the hill came forth, where the <i><cdplace visited="Y">Eeman</cdplace></i><!--River Eamont--> issues<!--modernisation of Gray's spelling--> out of the lake, &amp; continued my way along it's western shore close to the water<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Ullswater [western shore]</cdplace>-->, &amp; generally on a level with it.

<p><!--The following text is taken from the letter to Wharton dated 1 October 1769.-->The figure of <i><cdplace visited="Y">Ulz-water [??] shore</cdplace></i><!--Ullswater--> nothing resembles that laid down in our maps: it is 9 miles long, &amp; (at widest) under a mile in breadth. after extending itself 3m: &amp; &#189; in a line to S: W: it turns at the foot of <i><cdplace visited="N">Place-Fell</cdplace></i>, almost due West, and is here not twice the breadth of the <cdplace visited="N">Thames</cdplace><!--River Thames--> at <cdplace visited="N">London</cdplace>. it is soon again interrupted by the roots of <i><cdplace visited="N">Helvellyn</cdplace></i>, a lofty &amp; very rugged mountain, &amp; spreading again turns off to S: E:. &amp; is lost among the deep recesses <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> of the hills. to this second turning I pursued my way about four miles along its borders beyond a village scatter'd among trees &amp; calle'd <i><cdplace visited="Y">Water-malloch</cdplace></i><!--Watermillock-->, in a pleasant grave day, perfectly calm &amp; warm, but without a gleam of sunshine: then the sky seeming to thicken, the valley<!--<cdplace visited="Y">??</cdplace>--> to grow more desolate, &amp; evening drawing on, I return'd by the way I came to <i><cdplace visited="Y">Penrith</cdplace></i>.</p>




<p>Oct: 2. Wd<!--Again, Gray uses the abbreviated form--> at S: E:, sky clearing, <i><cdplace visited="N">Cross-fell</cdplace></i> misty, but the outline of the other hills very distinct. set out at 10 for <i><cdplace visited="N">Keswick</cdplace></i>, by the road <!--<cdplace visited="Y">??</cdplace>--> we went in 1767. saw <i><cdplace visited="U">Greystock</cdplace></i>-town<!--Greystoke--> &amp; castle<!--<cdplace visited="U">Greystoke Castle</cdplace>--> to the right, which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> lie only 3 miles (over the Fells) from <i><cdplace visited="N">Ulz-water</cdplace></i> <!--Ullswater-->. pass'd<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling--> through <i><cdplace visited="Y">Penradock</cdplace></i> <!--Penruddock--> &amp; <i><cdplace visited="Y">Threlcot</cdplace></i><!--Threlkeld--> at the feet of <i><cdplace visited="N">Saddleback</cdplace></i><!--Saddleback is also known as Blencathra.-->, whose furrow'd sides were gilt by the noon-day Sun, while its brow appear'd of a sad purple from the shadow of the clouds, as they sail'd slowly by it. the broad &amp; green valley of <i><cdplace visited="Y">Gardies</cdplace></i> <!--Guardhouse--> and <i><cdplace visited="Y">Low-side</cdplace></i>, with a swift stream<!--<cdplace visited="U">River Glenderamackin</cdplace>--> glittering among the cottages &amp; meadows to the left; &amp; the much finer (but narrower) valley of <i><cdplace visited="U">St John's</cdplace></i> opening into it: <i><cdplace visited="N">Hill-top</cdplace></i> the large, tho' low, mansion of the <person met="N">Gaskarths</person>, now a Farm-house, seated on an eminence among woods under a steep fell <!--<cdplace visited="N">Wallthwaite Crag</cdplace>-->, was what appear'd the most conspicuous, &amp; beside it a great rock<!--<cdplace visited="N">??</cdplace>--> like some antient tower nodding to its fall. pass'd <!--Slight amendment to Gray's own spelling.--> by the side of <i><cdplace visited="N">Skiddaw</cdplace></i> &amp; its cub call'd <i><cdplace visited="N">Latter-rig</cdplace></i><!--Latrigg-->, &amp; saw from an eminence <!--<cdplace visited="Y">??</cdplace>--> at two miles distance the Vale of Elysium<!--Here, Gray is presumably referring to the town of Keswick, Derwent Water and, beyond that, the valley of Borrowdale.--> in all its verdure, the sun then playing on the bosom of the lake<!--<cdplace visited="N">Derwent Water</cdplace>-->, &amp; lighting up all the mountains with its lustre.</p>

<p>Dined by two o'clock at the Queen's Head <!--Queen's Head, Keswick-->, &amp; then straggled out alone to the <i>Parsonage</i>, fell down on my back across <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> a dirty lane with my glass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> open in one hand, but broke only my knuckles: stay'd nevertheless<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->, &amp; saw the sun set in all its glory.</p>




<p>Oct: 3. Wd at S: E:, a heavenly day. rose at seven, &amp; walk'd out under the conduct of my Landlord to <i><cdplace visited="Y">Borrodale</cdplace></i><!--Borrowdale--><!--This is a classic example of the mapping problems presented by the non-linearity of Gray's account of his movement through the Lake District landscape: he begins by saying that he has travelled into Borrowdale but he then moves backwards in time to record his movement from the town of Keswick towards the valley.--> the grass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> was cover'd with a hoar-frost, which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> soon melted, &amp; exhaled in a thin blewish smoke. cross'd<!--Partial modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> the meadows obliquely, catching a diversity of views among the hills over the lake<!--<cdplace visited="N">Derwent Water</cdplace>--> &amp; islands, &amp; changing prospect at every ten paces, left <i><cdplace visited="N">Cockshut</cdplace></i> &amp; <cdplace visited="N">Castle-hill</cdplace><!--Castlehead Wood?--> (which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> we formerly mounted) behind me, &amp; drew near the foot of <i><cdplace visited="N">Walla Crag</cdplace></i>, whose bare &amp; rocky brow, cut perpendicularly down above 400 feet, as I guess<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->, awefully overlooks the way: our path here tends to the left, &amp; the ground gently rising, &amp; cover'd with a glade of scattering trees &amp; bushes on the very margin of the water, opens both ways the most delcious view, that my eyes ever beheld.</p>

<p>Behind you are the magnificent heights of <i><cdplace visited="N">Walla</cdplace></i>-crag<!--Walla Crag - Gray italicises Walla but not Crag-->; opposite lie the thick hanging woods of <person met="N">Lord Egremont</person><!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling of 'Lord'.-->, &amp; <i><cdplace visited="N">Newland</cdplace></i>-valley<!--Newlands Valley - Gray italicises Newland but not Valley--> with green &amp; smiling fields embosom'd in the dark cliffs; to the left the jaws of <i><cdplace visited="N">Borodale</cdplace></i><!--Jaws of Borrowdale-->, with that turbulent Chaos of mountain behind mountain roll'd in confusion; beneath you, &amp; stretching far away to the right, the shining purity of the <i>Lake</i><!--<cdplace visited="N">Derwent Water</cdplace>-->, just ruffled by the breeze enough to shew it is alive, reflecting rocks, woods, fields, &amp; inverted tops of mountains, with the white buildings of <i><cdplace visited="N">Keswick</cdplace></i>, <i><cdplace visited="N">Crosthwait</cdplace></i>-church<!--Crosthwaite Church - Gray italicises Crosthwait but not Church-->, &amp; <i><cdplace visited="N">Skiddaw</cdplace></i> for a back-ground at a distance. oh <person met="N">Doctor</person>! I never wish'd more for you; &amp; pray think, how the glass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> played its part in such a spot, which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> is called <i><cdplace visited="Y">Carf-close-reeds</cdplace></i><!--Calfclose Bay?-->: I chuse to set down these barbarous names, that any body may enquire on the place, &amp; easily find the particular station, that I mean.</p>

<p>This scene continues to <i><cdplace visited="U">Barrow-gate</cdplace></i>, &amp; a little farther, passing<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> a brook called <i><cdplace visited="Y">Barrow-beck</cdplace></i>, we enter'd <i><cdplace visited="Y">Borodale</cdplace></i><!--Borrowdale-->. the crags, named <i><cdplace visited="N">Lodoor-banks</cdplace></i> now begin to impend terribly over your way; &amp; more terribly, when you hear, that three years since an immense mass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> of rock tumbled at once from the brow, &amp; bar'd all access <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> to the dale<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Borrowdale</cdplace>--> (for this is the only road) till they could work their way thro' it. luckily no one was passing<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> at the time of this fall; but down the side of the mountain &amp; far into the lake<!--<cdplace visited="N">Derwent Water</cdplace>--> lie dispersed the huge fragments of this ruin in all shapes &amp; in all directions.</p>

<p>Something farther we turn'd aside into a coppice<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Screes Coppice?</cdplace>-->, ascending a little in front of <i><cdplace visited="Y">Lodoor</cdplace></i> water-fall<!--Lodore Falls - Gray only italicises "Lodoor"-->. the height appears to be about 200 feet, the quantity of water not great, tho' (these three days excepted) it had rain'd daily in the hills for near two months before: but then the stream was nobly broken, leaping from rock to rock, &amp; foaming with fury. on one side a towering crag<!--<cdplace visited="N">??</cdplace>-->, that spired up to equal, if not overtop, the neighbouring cliffs (this lay all in shade &amp; darkness<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> on the other hand a rounder broader projecting hill<!--<cdplace visited="N">??</cdplace>--> shag'd with wood &amp; illumined by the sun, which <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> glanced sideways on the upper part of the cataract. the force of the water wearing a deep channel in the ground hurries away to join the lake<!--<cdplace visited="N">Derwent Water</cdplace>-->. we descended again, &amp; passed<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> the stream <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Watendlath Beck?</cdplace>--> over a rude bridge, soon after we came under <i><cdplace visited="N">Gowder-crag</cdplace></i>, a hill more formidable to the eye &amp; to the apprehension than that of <i><cdplace visited="N">Lodoor</cdplace></i><!--Lodore-->; the rocks atop, deep-cloven perpendicularly by the rains, hanging loose &amp; nodding forwards, seem just starting from their base in shivers: the whole way down &amp; the road on both sides is strew'd with piles of the fragments strangely thrown across<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> each other &amp; of a dreadful bulk. the place reminds one of those passes<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> in the <cdplace visited="N">Alps</cdplace>, where the Guides tell you to move on with speed, &amp; say nothing, lest the agitation of the air should loosen the snows above, &amp; bring down a mass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> that would overwhelm a caravan. I took their<!--<person met="Y">guide(s)</person>--> counsel here and hasten'd on in silence.</p>

<p>Oct: 3. The hills here are cloth'd all up their steep sides with oak, ash, birch, holly &amp;c: some of it has been cut 40 years ago, some within these 8 years, yet all is sprung again green, flourishing, &amp; tall for its age, in a place where no soil appears but the staring rock, &amp; where a man could scarce stand upright.</p>

<p>Met a civil young <person met="Y">Farmer</person> overseeing his reapers (for it is oat-harvest here) who conducted us to a neat white house<!--<cdplace visited="Y">??</cdplace>--> in the village of <cdplace visited="Y">Grange</cdplace>, which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> is built on a rising ground in the midst of a valley. round it the mountains form an aweful ampitheatre, &amp; thro' it obliquely runs the <cdplace visited="Y">Darwent</cdplace><!--River Derwent--> clear as glass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->, &amp; shewing under it's bridge every trout that passes<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->. beside the village<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Grange</cdplace>--> rises a round eminence of rock cover'd entirely with old trees<!--<cdplace visited="N">Holmcrag Wood?</cdplace>-->, &amp; over that more proudly towers <i><cdplace visited="N">Castle-crag</cdplace></i>, invested also with wood on its sides, &amp; bearing on its naked top some traces of a fort said to be Roman.</p>

<p>By the side of this hill<!--<cdplace visited="N">Castle Crag</cdplace>-->, the valley <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Borrowdale</cdplace>-->turns to the left &amp; contracts its dimensions, till there is hardly any road but the rocky bed of the river<!--<cdplace visited="Y">River Derwent</cdplace>-->. the wood of the mountains increases &amp; their summits grow loftier to the eye, &amp; of more fantastic forms: among them appear <i><cdplace visited="N">Eagle's-cliff</cdplace></i>, <i><cdplace visited="N">Dove's-nest</cdplace></i>, <i><cdplace visited="N">Whitedale-pike</cdplace></i>, &amp;c: celebrated names in the annals of <cdplace visited="N">Keswick</cdplace>. the dale <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Borrowdale</cdplace>-->opens about four miles higher till you come to <i><cdplace visited="N">Sea-Whaite</cdplace></i><!--Seathwaite--> (where lies the way mounting the hills to the right, that leads to the <i>Wadd-mines</i>) all farther access<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> is here barr'd to prying Mortals, only there is a little path winding over the Fells<!--<cdplace visited="N">Sty Head Pass?</cdplace>-->, &amp; for some weeks in the year passable <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> to the Dale's-men; but the Mountains know well, that these innocent people will not reveal the mysteries of their ancient kingdom, the reign of Chaos &amp; old Night. only I learn'd, that this dreadful road dividing again leads one branch to <i><cdplace visited="N">Ravenglas</cdplace></i><!--Ravenglass-->, &amp; the other to <i><cdplace visited="N">Hawkshead</cdplace></i>.</p>

<p>For me I went no farther than the <person met="Y">Farmer's</person> (better than 4m: from Keswick) at <i><cdplace visited="Y">Grange</cdplace></i>: his <person met="Y">Mother</person> &amp; he brought us butter, that Siserah would have jump'd at, tho' not in a lordly dish<!--Allusion to the Book of Judges.-->, bowls of milk, thin oaten-cakes, &amp; ale; &amp; we had carried a cold tongue thither with us. our <person met="Y">Farmer</person> was himself the Man, that last year plundered the Eagle's eirie: all the dale are up in arms on such an occasion, for they lose abundance of lambs yearly, not to mention hares, partridge, grous, &amp;c: he was let down from the cliff in ropes to the shelf of rock, on which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->the nest was built, the people above shouting &amp; hollowing to fright the old birds, which <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->flew screaming round, but did not dare to attack him. he brought off the eaglet (for there is rarely more than one) &amp; an addle egg. the nest was roundish &amp; more than a yard over, made of twigs twisted together. seldom a year passes<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->but they take the brood or eggs, &amp; sometimes they shoot one, sometimes the other Parent, but the surviver has always found a mate (probably in Ireland) &amp; they breed near the old place. by his description I learn, that this species is the <i>Erne</i> (the Vultur <i>Albicilla</i> of Linnaeus in his last edition, but in yours <i>Falco Albicilla</i>) so consult <person met="N">Pennant</person> about it.</p>

<p>Walk'd leisurely home<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Keswick</cdplace>--> the way we came, but saw a new landscape: the features indeed were the same in part, but many new ones were disclosed by the mid-day Sun, &amp; the tints were entirely changed. take notice this was the best or perhaps the one day for going up <cdplace visited="N">Skiddaw</cdplace>, but I thought it better employ'd: it was perfectly serene, &amp; hot as midsummer.</p>

<p>In the evening walk'd alone down to the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Derwent Water</cdplace>-->by the side of <i><cdplace visited="N">Crow-Park</cdplace></i> after sunset &amp; saw the solemn colouring of night draw on, the last gleam of sunshine fading away on the hill-tops, the deep serene of the waters, &amp; the long shadows of the mountains thrown across<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->them, till they nearly touch'd the hithermost shore. at distance heard the murmur of many waterfalls not audible in the day-time. wish'd for the Moon, but she was <i>dark to me &amp; silent, hid in her vacant interlunar cave.</i></p>



<p>Oct: 4. Wd E:, clouds &amp; sunshine, &amp; in the course of the day a few drops of rain. Walk'd to <i><cdplace visited="Y">Crow-park</cdplace></i>, now a rough pasture once a glade of ancient oaks, whose large roots still remain on the ground, but nothing has sprung from them. if one single tree had remain'd, this would have been an unparallel'd spot, &amp; <person met="N">Smith</person> judged right, when he took his print of the Lake<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Derwent Water</cdplace>-->hence, for it is a gentle eminence, not too high, on the very margin of the water &amp; commanding it from end to end, looking full into the <i>gorge of <cdplace visited="N">Borodale</cdplace></i><!--Borrowdale-->. I prefer it even to <i><cdplace visited="Y">Cockshut-hill</cdplace></i><!--Gray only italicises "Cockshut"-->, which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> lies beside it, &amp; to which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> I walk'd in the afternoon: it is cover'd with young trees both sown &amp; planted, oak, spruce, scotch-fir, &amp;c: all which <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> thrive wonderfully. there is an easy ascent to the top, &amp; the view far preferable to that on <cdplace visited="N">Castle-hill</cdplace> (which <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->you<!--<person>Dr. Thomas Wharton</person>--> remember) because this is lower &amp; nearer to the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="N">Derwent Water</cdplace>-->: for I find all points, that are much elevated, spoil the beauty of the valley, &amp; make its parts (which <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> are not large) look poor &amp; diminutive. while I was here, a little shower fell, red clouds came marching up the hills from the east, &amp; part of a bright rainbow seem'd to rise along the side of <cdplace visited="N">Castle-hill</cdplace>.</p>

<p>From hence I got to the <i>Parsonage</i><!--<cdplace visited="Y">Crosthwaite Grange</cdplace>--> a little before Sunset, &amp; saw in my glass <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->a picture, that if I could transmitt to you, &amp; fix it in all the softness <!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->of its living colours, would fairly sell for a thousand pounds. this is the sweetest scene I can yet discover in point of pastoral beauty. the rest are in a sublimer style.</p>

<p><!--Gray's journal entry for 10 October 1769 raises questions about the way in which we define the Lake District.

<p>Ascended the <cdplace visited="Y">Castle-hill</cdplace> in a fine afternoon. it takes up the higher top of the eminence on which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> it stands, &amp; is irregularly round, encompassed<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> with a deep mote. in front towards the Town is a magnificent Gothick Gateway, lofty &amp; huge, the overhanging battlements are supported by a triple range of corbels, the intervals pierced thro' &amp; shewing the day from above. on its top rise light watchtowers of small height. it opens below with a grand pointed arch: over this is a wrought tabernacle, doubtless<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling--> once containing the Founders figure, on one side a shield of <cdplace visited="N">France</cdplace> semy quarter'd with <cdplace visited="N">England</cdplace>, on the other the same with a label ermine for <person met="N">John of Gant D</person>: of <cdplace visited="Y">Lancaster</cdplace>. this opens to a court within, which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> I did not much care to enter, being the County Gaol &amp; full of Prisoners, both Criminals &amp; Debtors. from this gateway the walls continue &amp; join it to a vast square tower of great height, the lower part at least of remote antiquity, for it has small round-headed lights with plain short pillars on each side of them, there is a third tower also square &amp; of less<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> dimensions. this is all the castle, near it &amp; but little lower stands the Church, a large &amp; plain Gothic fabrick, the high square Tower at the West-end has been rebuilt of late years, but nearly in the same style. there are no ornaments of arms, &amp;c: any where to be seen. within it is lightsome &amp; spacious, but not one monument of antiquity, or piece of painted glass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> is left. from the Church-yard there is an extensive sea-view (for now the tide had almost cover'd the sands<!--<cdplace visited="N">Lancaster Sands</cdplace>-->, &amp; fill'd the river<!--<cdplace visited="N">River Lune</cdplace>-->) &amp; besides greatest part of <cdplace visited="N">Furness</cdplace><!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> I could distinguish <i><cdplace visited="N">Peel-Castle</cdplace></i><!--Gray only italicises "Peel"--> on the <cdplace visited="N">isle of Fowdrey</cdplace><!--Foulney-->, which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> lies off its southern extremity. the Town<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Lancaster</cdplace>--> is built on the slope &amp; at the feet of the <cdplace visited="Y">Castle-hill</cdplace> more than twice the bigness<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> of <cdplace visited="N">Aukland</cdplace><!--Bishop Auckland?--> with many neat buildings of white stone, but a little disorderly in their position ad libitum like <cdplace visited="N">Kendal</cdplace>. many also extend below on the keys by the river-side, where a number of ships were moor'd, some of them three-mast vessels<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> deck'd out with their colours in honor of the Fair. here is a good bridge<!--<cdplace visited="N">??</cdplace>--> of 4 arches over the <i>Lune</i><!--<cdplace visited="N">River Lune</cdplace>-->, which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> runs (when the tide is out) in two streams<!--<cdplace visited="N">??</cdplace>--> divided by a bed of gravel, which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> is not cover'd but in spring-tides. below the town it widens to near the breadth of the<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.-->Thames<!--<cdplace visited="N">River Thames</cdplace>--> at <cdplace visited="N">London</cdplace>, &amp; meets the sea<!--<cdplace visited="N">Irish Sea</cdplace>--> at 5 or 6 m: distance to S:W:</p>



<p><!--As with the entry for 10 October 1769, Gray is located in a landscape well beyond the modern boundaries of the Lake District as defined by the National Park Authority. But Poutlon, the coastal village in which he spends the day, can be seen to be part of a wider model of 'Greater Lakeland', to borrow a term used by the twentieth-century poet and topographer, Norman Nicholson. As William Roberts points out, the towns of 'Morecambe and Heysham did not exist at that time: they came later with the development of an Irish ferry terminal and the coming of the railway in the 1840s-->Oct: 11. Wind<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> S:W: clouds &amp; sun. warm &amp; a fine dappled sky. cross'd<!--Partial modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> the river<!--<cdplace visited="Y">River Lune</cdplace>--> &amp; walk'd over a peninsula<!--<cdplace visited="Y">??</cdplace>--> 3 miles to the village of <i><cdplace visited="Y">Pooton</cdplace></i><!--Poulton?--> which<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> stands on the beach. an old <person met="Y">Fisherman</person> mending his nets (while I enquired about the danger of passing<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> those sands<!--<cdplace visited="N">Lancaster Sands</cdplace>-->) told me in his dialect a moving story, how a brother of the trade, a <person met="N"><i>Cockler</i></person> (as he styled him) driving a little cart with two daughters (women grown) in it, &amp; his Wife on horseback following, set out one day to pass<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> the 7 mile sands, as they had frequently been used to do, for nobody in the village knew them better than the old Man did. when they were about haf way over, a thick fog rose, &amp; as they advanced, they found the water much deeper than they expected. the old man was puzzled, he stop'd, &amp; said he would go a little way to find some mark he was acquainted with. they staid a little while for him, but in vain. they call'd aloud, but no reply. at last the young women press'd<!--Partial modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> their mother to think, where they were, &amp; go on. she would not leave the place, she wander'd about forlon &amp; amazed, she would not quit her horse, &amp; get into the cart with them. they determined after much time wasted to turn back, &amp; give themselves up to the guidance of their horses. the old Woman was soon wash'd off and perish'd. the poor Girls clung close to their cart, &amp; the horse sometimes wading &amp; sometimes swimming brought them back to land alive, but senseless<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> with terror &amp; distress<!--Modernisation of Gray's spelling.--> &amp; unable for many days to give an account of themselves. the bodies of their parents were found soon after; that of the Father a vert few paces distant from the spot, where he had left them.</p>

<p>In the afternoon wander'd about the town<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Lancaster</cdplace>--> &amp; by the key<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Lancaster Quay</cdplace>--> till it grew dark. a little rain fell.

<!--In his 2001 edition of 'Thomas Gray's Journal of his Visit to the Lake District in October 1769', William Roberts covers the next three days of Gray's tour of northern England: days in which, according to Roberts's own titles, Gray journeys from 'Lancaster to Settle'; visits 'Gordale Scar'; and, finally, travels from 'Settle to Otley'. Within the context of the current mapping project, the primary interest is Gray's account of his time spent travelling around the Lake District: the old counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and north Lancashire. As a result, Gray's excursion into north Yorkshire lies beyond the spatial parameters necessarily imposed - perhaps artificially - by the present project. --></p>
