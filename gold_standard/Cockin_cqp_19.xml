<p><i>HOW the following Ode came to be written is not here needful to say: But</i> being written, <i>and the author concurring in opinion with some of his friends, that it might yield an innocent amusement to the votaries of a fashionable and innocent object, he consented to have it published. Moved simply by this hope, he throws the piece only into the way of</i> actual tourists. <i>And through he is not insensible of the pleasure of being found a successful admirer of the muses, yet his disclaims the idea of offering it to the public as a literary  production. If he can manage his subject so as to make it entertaining, he will have gained an end held too valuable by his feelings to allow of any regrets for the loss of superior praise.</i></p>

<line>I.</line>
<line>HAIL, O thou! whose rising fame</line>
<line>Unusual progress makes;</line>
<line>Thou, whom Fancy hence shall name</line>
<line>The Genius of the lakes;</line>
<line>The Muse, who ever loves to trace</line>
<line>Whate'er is fair on Nature's face,</line>
<line>And see, though long with clouds o'ercast,</line>
<line>Neglected worth shine forth at last,</line>
<pb n="6"/>
<line>And simple taste and truth prevail</line>
<line>Greets thee well, and bids the hail!</line>
<line>And if the strain may interpose</line>
<line>Aught form'd to sooth, or gently close</line>	
<line>One beauteous effort of thy skill,</line>
<line>Let the Muse her aim fulfil</line>
<line>Let her unfold, drawn from the dorian lyre,</line>
<line>What thy bright sylvan groves, and varying fate inspire.</line>
</stanza>
<stanza>

<line>Long ere these happier days of genuine taste,</line>
<line>Which give thy magic scenes encomium due</line>
<line>Through many an age, with like enchanted grac'd,</line>
<line>Thy rills keep tinkling, and thy thickets grew;</line>
<line>Yet this was felt by few:</line>
<line>Unconscious of their matchless charms,</line>
<line>Unskilled in scenic art,</line>
<line>And how refin'd perception warms</line>
<line>Whate'er can touch the heart</line>
<line>Then save the joy which gen'ral nature yields,</line>
<line>The swain with fervour flight survey'd thy beauteous fields.</line>

<line>Still, howe'er without regret,</line>
<line>Thou'dst ply thy plastic skill;</line>
<line>Toil but seems an easy debt,</line>
<line>When fancy has its will.</line>
<line>To form thy wat'ry rounds complete,</line>
<line>By prototypes supremely neat,</line>
<line>And give them what might challenge fame</line>
<line>Though ne'er bestow'd, was all thy aim:</line>
<line>Content, the while with self-applause,</line>
<line>Beauty's charms, and soft repose.</line>
<line>Thus innate worth still acts her part,</line>
<line>The best spectator her own heart;</line>
<line>And thus, though o'er the sylvan green,</line>
<line>"&quot;Full many a flowret blush unseen,"&quot;</line>
<line>Yet oft these blooms, once notic'd, have been found,</line>
<line>The pride of Flora's host, and through the world renown'd.</line>

<line>And now, when bright thy day of honour dawns,</line>

<line>Now mark thy rills and bold cascades,</line>
<line>Or scale some mountain high;</line>
<line>Inspir'd by Taste, to Nature's int'rests true,</line>
<line>They deem all labour light, which brings thy charms to view.</line>

<line>Thou, whose pleasure is to please,</line>
<line>I know wilt feel its fire.</line>
<line>And, O when, its sickness pale,</line>
<line>Some virgin seeks thy balmy gale</line>
<line>Or hopeless, cheerless lover sees</line>
<line>His vigour waste by slow degrees,</line>
<line>While Nature in the dim sunk eye</line>
<line>Bids Art its speediest help apply;</line>
<pb n="9"/>
<line>Then thy breezes wing with health: -- </line>
<line>To chear their minds, as if by stealth,</line>
<line>They footing pictures interpose,</line>

<line>So, many a train of busy cares,</line>
<line>Which hurt the human mind,</line>
<line>In Taste's fair bosom, unawares,</line>

<line>By dew-brush'd footsteps, round and round,</line>

<note id="n7"> There is no doubt but that leave for erections of this sort  might easily be gained on any proper site, and that they would long be preserved almost religiously inviolate.</note>
<p>IN Article 8th of <i>Addenda</i> to the new edition of <cdtitle><i>The Guide to the Lakes</i></cdtitle> it is recommended, as a particular that would greatly contribute to the perfection of this beautiful region, to have proper objects placed on some of the eminences with which it abounds. The author of this piece is fully aware of the vanity ready to be attributed to every one, who on any occasion attends to dictate to the public; and yet he cannot <i>here</i> (with the greatest deference) take the opportunity to suggest another particular of a like kind which he fancies, may merit attention by future tourists. What is here meant is the erection of inscribed pillars, tablets, &#38;c. by the affluent visitors, near a favourite lake or station,<ptr target="n7"/> commemorative of some friend, person of genius, &#38;c. or of the time

<pb n="22"/>
when they themselves enjoyed the pleasure of viewing the surrounding objects. They might thus, in a part which gives the fairest play to genuine feeling and fancy, ether evince their regard for merit, and their love of nature, or record their friendships, and recall to the minds of posterity, that <i>they too had visited Arcadia</i>. The undertaking would not only beautify these scenes, and give occasion to many a pleasing reflection, but I flatter myself, be a credit to the national taste, and in time become itself a new inducement to make a tour which must contribute to health, while it recreates with the most innocent of pleasures. Invention would find endless hints for these erections and inscriptions; but it is submitted to those who approve of the design, whether it would not be proper, as a specimen of such commemorative ornaments, to gain with a memorial of the late <cdperson>DR. BROWN</cdperson> on the border of <cdplace><i>Derwent-water</i></cdplace>, and of <cdperson>MR. GRAY</cdperson> near the lake of <cdplace><i>Grasmere</i></cdplace>. These lakes have received singular honour from their pens, and the world will long be amused and instructed by their more elaborate performances.</p>

<line>To thy happy soil we owe</line>
<line>Full many an honour'd name.</line>
</poem>
<p>THE difficulty of introducing a list of names into verse is evident. When they are numerous a part only must be selected, and whatever be the rule of preference laid down by the poet, still they may prove intractable on account of accent and quantity. Regularity and completeness must not therefore in this case
<pb n="23"/>
be expected. But as the deficiency may be remedied by a note, and the author fancies a catalogue of the celebrated men, who have been born in the district of the lakes or at least in the counties of <cdplace><i>Westmorland</i></cdplace> and <cdplace><i>Cumberland</i></cdplace>, might entertain his readers, he has subjoined the following one. This he was more especially induced to draw up, as the late historians of these two counties have not through proper to allot a <i>distinct</i> portion of their volumes to so agreeable a topic; not do their <i>detached</i> accounts enter regularly into the index. After all, the author is conscious, that this list is imperfect, but he had not the opportunities he could have wishes to complete it.</p>
<p>For further and more particular satisfaction it may be necessary to observe, that those names whose characters may be found at large in the present edition of the <cdtitle><i>Biographia Britannica</i></cdtitle><ptr target="n8"/> are marked [B.B.] Those on the <cdtitle><i>Biographical Dictionary</i></cdtitle> [B.D.] and those in <cdtitle><i>Noorthouck's Dictionary</i></cdtitle> [N.]--An asterisx (*) is prefixed to the names that are mentioned in the verses.</p>

<p>*<cdperson>SOWERBY (JOSEPH)</cdperson> a man of most extraordinary genius and proficiency in the mathematics. Though, in a account of his early death, and other circumstances, he has not left any works behind him to perpetuate his name, yet his uncommon abilities, and amiable manners, deserve to be recorded; and I wish this slight revival of his memory may induce some person who knows his history to draw up a regular account of his life for the inspection of the public. Though it is from the fruit we are the most ready to praise the tree, yet promising blossoms ever deserve admiration, should they not arrive at the maturity which demands out gratitude. That what is related of him here, and at the close of the stanza referred to, is not without

A gentleman not only of uncommon genius, but singular proficiency in mathematical learning. Without education to improve, -- without fortune to advance, -- without friends to recommend him, -- without breeding to engage, --- without address to win, --- without eloquence to persuade, he not only deserved but procured the esteem of the most conversant in that noble and abstruse science. But that excessive application to study, which (under all these disadvantages) brought him into the regard of the learned world, cut off, at the age of 28, a genius that wanted only time to have ripened into that of a second <cdperson>Newton</cdperson>."&quot;</p>

<line>And, were it meet to dwell on living fame,</line>
<line>Still do thy studious sons high Attic honours claim.</line>
</poem>
<p>A properly informed mind, I should think, would always experience a peculiar difficulty in publicly touching upon the characters of men; especially of those that are living. The present licentious state of the press has, however, in a good measure destroyed this delicacy, and the self-interested tourist (as well as the factious
<pb n="30"/>
politician) now finds his account, more in retailing personal anecdotes, and giving glimpses (however partial and imperfect) at living <i>character</i>, than in avowed purport of his title-page. When this practice terminates in <i>censure</i>, there is certainly something cruel in it, and when in <i>praise</i>, though well meant and morally right, it may nevertheless for many reasons give pain to the object. Partly from these consideration the author here foregoes a tempting opportunity to introduce a few pages into his work, which would stand a great chance, merely of themselves, to recommend the rest to public notice. For there are several men now living, born in the neighbourhood of the lakes, that for strength of genius, depth of learning, proficiency in arts, elegance of taste, and rectitude of understanding, are an ornament to their age and nation. Still however he declines being particular: He is afraid of hurting the delicacy of <i>some</i> with the manner of notice, and offending <i>all</i> with the insignificance of the vehicle.</p>
