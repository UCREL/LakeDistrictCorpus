<p>The country between <cdplace><i>Moffat</i></cdplace> and <cdplace><i>Lockerby</i></cdplace> is very good, a mixture of downs and corn-land, with a few &#383;mall woods: the country grows quite flat and very unplea&#383;ant. Cro&#383;s a fmall river called the <cdplace><i>Sark</i></cdplace>, which divides the two kingdoms, and enter <cdplace>CUMBERLAND</cdplace>.</p>
<p>About three miles farther cro&#383;s the <cdplace><i>E&#383;k</i></cdplace> over a hand&#383;ome &#383;tone-bridge, and lie at the &#383;mall village of <cdplace><i>Longtown</i></cdplace>. The country is very rich in corn, but quite bare of trees, and very flat. Near this village, at <cdplace><i>Netherby</i></cdplace> are the ruins of a <i>Roman</i> &#383;ta-, 

<pb n="217"/>
tion, where &#383;tatues, weapons and coins are often dug up.</p>
<p>Cro&#383;s the <cdplace><i>Eden</i></cdplace> to <cdplace><i>Carli&#383;le</i></cdplace> a plea&#383;ant city, &#383;urrounded with walls, like <cdplace><i>Che&#383;ter</i></cdplace>, but they are very dirty, and kept in very bad repair. The ca&#383;tle is antient, but makes a good appearance at a di&#383;tance: the view from it is fine, of rich meadows, at this time covered with thou&#383;ands of cattle, it being fair-day. The <cdplace><i>Eden</i></cdplace> here forms two branches, and infulates the ground; over one is a bridge of four, over the other one of nine arches. There is be&#383;ides a pro&#383;pect of a rich country, and a di&#383;tant view of <cdplace><i>Cold-fells</i></cdplace>, <cdplace><i>Cro&#383;s-fells</i></cdplace>, <cdplace><i>Skiddaw</i></cdplace>, and other mountains.</p>
<p>The cathedral<ptr target="n1"/> is very imperfect, <cdperson>Cromwell</cdperson> having pulled down part to build barracks with the materials. There remains &#383;ome portion that was built in the <i>Saxon</i> times, with very ma&#383;&#383;y pillars and round arches. The re&#383;t is more modern, &#383;aid to have been built in the reign of <cdperson><i>Edward</i> III.</cdperson> who had in one part an apartment to lodge in. The arches in this latter building are &#383;harp-pointed: the ca&#383;t window remarkably fine.</p>
<p>The manufactures of <cdplace><i>Carli&#383;le</i></cdplace> are chiefly of printed linnens, for which near 3000l. <i>per ann</i>. is paid in duties. It is al&#383;o noted for a great manufacture of whips, which employs numbers of children.</p>
<p>Salmons appear in the <cdplace><i>Eden</i></cdplace> in numbers &#383;o early as the months of <i>December</i> and <i>January</i>; and the <cdplace><i>London</i></cdplace> and even <cdplace><i>Newca&#383;tle</i></cdplace> markets, are &#383;upplied with early fi&#383;h from this river: but it is remarkable,
<pb n="218"/>
that they do not vi&#383;it the <cdplace><i>E&#383;k</i></cdplace> in any quantity till <i>April</i>, notwith&#383;tanding the mouths of both the&#383;e waters are at a &#383;mall di&#383;tance from each other. I omitted in its proper place an account of the <cdplace><i>Newca&#383;tle</i></cdplace> fi&#383;hery, therefore in&#383;ert here the little I could collect relating to it: the fi&#383;h &#383;eldom appear in the <cdplace>Tyne</cdplace> till February: there are about 24 fi&#383;heries on the river, be&#383;ides a very con&#383;iderable were, and the whole annual capture amounts to about 36,000 fi&#383;h. I was informed that once the fi&#383;h were brought from <cdplace><i>Berwick</i></cdplace> and cured at <cdplace><i>Newca&#383;tle</i></cdplace>; but at pre&#383;ent, notwith&#383;tanding all goes under the name of <cdplace><i>Newcaf&#383;tle</i></cdplace> Salmon, very little is taken there, in companion of what is caught in the <cdplace><i>Tweed</i></cdplace>.</p>
<note id="n1"> Begun by <i>Walter</i>, deputy of the&#383;e parts, under <cdperson><i>William Rufus</i></cdperson>; but the new choir was not founded till about 1354.</note>
<p>The country near <cdplace><i>Carli&#383;le</i></cdplace> con&#383;i&#383;ts of &#383;mall enclo&#383;ures; but a little farther on, towards <cdplace><i>Penrith</i></cdplace>, changes into coar&#383;e downs. On the ea&#383;t, at a di&#383;tance, are ridges of high hills running parallel to the road, with a good inclo&#383;ed country in the intervening &#383;pace. Above <cdplace><i>Penrith</i></cdplace> is a rich inclo&#383;ed tract, mixed with hedge-row trees and woods. On the &#383;outh-we&#383;t, a pro&#383;pect of high and craggy mountains. After I left <cdplace><i>Lockerby</i></cdplace>, Nature, as if exhau&#383;ted with her labors in the lofty hills of <cdplace><i>Scotland</i></cdplace>, &#383;eemed to have lain down and repo&#383;ed her&#383;elf for a con&#383;iderable &#383;pace; but here began to ri&#383;e again with all the &#383;ublimity of <i>alpine</i> maje&#383;ty.</p>
<p><cdplace>PENRITH</cdplace> is an antient town, &#383;eated at the foot of a hill: is a great thoroughfare for travellers; but has little other trade, except a &#383;mall one of checks. The church is very neat, the gallery &#383;upported by large columns, each formed of a &#383;ingle &#383;tone. In the church-yard is a monument of great

<pb n="219"/>
antiquity, con&#383;i&#383;ting of two &#383;tone pillars eleven feet &#383;ix inches high, and five in circumference in the lower part, which is rounded; the upper is &#383;quare, and tapers to a point: in the &#383;quare part is &#383;ome fret-work, and the relievo of a cro&#383;s. Both the&#383;e &#383;tones are morti&#383;ed at their lower part into a round one: they are about fifteen feet a&#383;under; the &#383;pace between them is inclo&#383;ed on each &#383;ide with two very large but thin &#383;emicircular &#383;tones, &#383;o that there is left a walk between pillar and pillar of two feet in breadth. Two of the&#383;e le&#383;&#383;er &#383;tones are plain, the other two have certain figures at pre&#383;ent &#383;carce intelligible.</p>
<p>Cro&#383;s the <cdplace><i>Emot</i></cdplace>, a &#383;mall river, and &#383;oon after the <cdplace><i>Lowther</i></cdplace>, over <cdplace><i>Yeoman&#8217;s</i> Bridge</cdplace>, near which I enter</p>
<p><cdplace>WESTMORLAND</cdplace>. About four miles farther cro&#383;s <cdplace><i>Clifton</i> Moor</cdplace>, where the Rebels made a &#383;hort &#383;tand in 1745, and &#383;acrificed a few men to &#383;ave the re&#383;t of their army. Pa&#383;s over <cdplace><i>Shap</i> Fells</cdplace>, more black, dreary, and melancholy, than any of the Highland hills, being not only very barren but de&#383;titute of every picture&#383;que beauty. This barren &#383;cene continued till within a &#383;mall diftance of</p>
<p><cdplace>KENDAL</cdplace>, a large town on the <cdplace>river <i>Kent</i></cdplace>, in a rich and beautifull vale, well cultivated, and prettily wooded. Here is a very great trade in knit wor&#383;ted-&#383;tockings, &#383;ome lin&#383;ies, and a coar&#383;e &#383;ort of cloth, called cottons, for the <cdplace><i>Guinea</i></cdplace> trade.</p>
<p>Near <cdplace><i>Burton</i></cdplace> enter <cdplace>LANCASHIRE</cdplace>. Reach its capital, <cdplace><i>Lanca&#383;ter</i></cdplace>, a large and well-built town, &#383;eated on the <cdplace><i>Lune</i></cdplace>, a river navigable for &#383;hips of 250 tuns as high as the bridge. The cu&#383;tom-hou&#383;e is a &#383;mall but mo&#383;t elegant building, with a portico

<pb n="220"/>
&#383;upported by four ionic pillars, ona beautifull plain pediment. There is a double &#383;light of &#383;teps, a ru&#383;tic &#383;urba&#383;e and coins; a work that does much redit to <cdperson>Mr. <i>Gillar</i></cdperson>, the architect, an inhabitant of this town.</p>
<p>The church is &#383;eated on an eminence, and commands an exten&#383;ive but not plea&#383;ing view. The ca&#383;tle is entire, the courts of ju&#383;tice are held in it;  and is al&#383;o the county jail. The front is very hand&#383;ome, con&#383;i&#383;ts of two large angular towers, with a hand&#383;ome gateway between.</p>
<p>Ha&#383;tened through <cdplace><i>Preston</i></cdplace>, <cdplace><i>Wiggan</i></cdplace>, <cdplace><i>Warrington</i></cdplace>, and <cdplace><i>Chester</i></cdplace>, and fini&#383;hed my journey with a rapture of which no fond parent can be ignorant, that of being again re&#383;tored to two innocent prattlers after an ab&#383;ence eqully regretted by all parties.</p>
