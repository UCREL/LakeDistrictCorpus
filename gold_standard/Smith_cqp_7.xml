  <head level="3" align="center"><i>SIR,</i></head>
   <p>I WAS made extremely &#383;en&#383;ible of the want of correct maps in the cour&#383;e of my <i>&#383;urvey</i>; in my opinion, the nation ought to encourage general meridians throu&#8217; <cdplace><i>Britain</i></cdplace>, at lea&#383;t  from <cdplace><i>Berwick</i></cdplace> to the &#383;outh coa&#383;t of <cdplace><i>England</i></cdplace>, as has been done in <cdplace><i>France</i></cdplace>. Geography gains ground fa&#383;t, and by a few ob&#383;ervations of the eclip&#383;es of <i>Jupiter</i>&#8217;s &#383;atellites, made at different places by proper ob&#383;ervators, our longitudes might all be corrected. The principal objection, I own, is the great expence of the work; but it is well known that <i>Moll</i>&#8217;s little erroneous trifles, built altogether on copy, took very well, and certainly in a more curious age, correct ones would not want  encouragement.</p>
   <p>It was my bu&#383;ine&#383;s every night to prepare meridians, by the north-pole, in ca&#383;e of mi&#383;takes by the needle, after allowance made for the po&#383;ition of the pole-star from the point of the earth&#8217;s produc&#8217;d axis, again&#383;t my mornings works. I could not find, that the points of <cdplace><i>Darwent</i></cdplace> mouth bore near &#383;o much we&#383;t as &#383;uppos&#8217;d in the pre&#383;ent maps, the makers of which, I imagine, depended on the magnetical meridian more than the &#383;olar one.--</p>
   <p>And, indeed, as the difference of the magnetical and &#383;olar meridians is very near 18&#176; on this coa&#383;t, it is not to be wonder&#8217;d that &#383;urveys, following the needle, &#383;hould throw all promontories &#383;o much &#383;outh of we&#383;t, and all coa&#383;ts too much we&#383;t of &#383;outh, as &#383;eems to be the ca&#383;e, in con&#383;tructing on the&#383;e principles; the magnetical being a fal&#383;e meridian, tho&#8217; &#383;ailors u&#383;e it for a true one.</p>
   <p>Ob&#383;ervations by the magnetical needle uncorrected by the &#383;olar, are at lea&#383;t about 1&#189; point we&#383;t of the north. It has encrea&#383;ed on this coa&#383;t &#383;ince 1715 from 14&#176; to 17&#176; 30&#8217;, where it is now, but is &#383;till encrea&#383;ing.--I have marked the po&#383;ition of the &#383;ands from the be&#383;t intelligence--Tho&#8217; the &#383;ea coa&#383;t is mo&#383;t u&#383;eful to be taken as it appears, for the &#383;ervice of mariners, yet it is great pity that public encouragement is not offer&#8217;d for accurate maps of the land al&#383;o.</p>
   <p>I began, at the monuent on <cdplace><i>Burgh Mar&#383;h</i></cdplace>, to mea&#383;ure off the <cdplace><i>Solway</i></cdplace> bay; and as the ground was very low, I took &#383;everal ba&#383;es of triangles, to mea&#383;ure the oppo&#383;ite &#383;hore, and fix its

   Principal points. For general heights to keep con&#383;tantly in my eye, I fixed on three remarkable mountains, as judging they might be &#383;een thro&#8217; the greatest part of the extent of my &#383;urvey; the&#383;e were <cdplace><i>Skiddow</i></cdplace> in <cdplace><i>Cumberland</i></cdplace>, <cdplace><i>Criffield</i></cdplace>, and <cdplace><i>Burn&#383;wark</i></cdplace> in <cdplace><i>Scotland</i></cdplace>, which appeared, as in the draights. The di&#383;tances were determined thus:</p>
   <p>I mea&#383;ured a ba&#383;e line on <cdplace><i>Burgh Mar&#383;h</i></cdplace>, after correcting the magnetical meridian; this was directed to a tree on an eminence near <cdplace><i>Drumbugh</i></cdplace>, as judging it the longest cour&#383;e in a plain. I carefully examined every angle from each of the&#383;e &#383;tations, and fix&#8217;d the &#383;everal places as &#383;pecified in my draught. It took me up &#383;ome time to get proper a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tants, and fix <cdplace><i>Skiddow</i></cdplace>, one of my principal aims; the ground be&#383;ides being very trouble&#383;ome, by rea&#383;on of the frequent creeks and quick &#383;ands, &#383;o I could reach no farther than <cdplace><i>Bowne&#383;s</i></cdplace> on the 27th at night. From the monument the coa&#383;t is extremely low on the <i>Engli&#383;h</i> &#383;ide, and a fine pa&#383;ture till <cdplace><i>Drumbugh</i></cdplace>.</p>
   <p>At <cdplace><i>Bowne&#383;s</i></cdplace> I took a new meridian to a&#383;certain the truth of my triangles. It is properly &#383;o called from the bend of the coa&#383;t at this promontory, which is the mo&#383;t remarkable one on the <cdplace><i>Solway</i></cdplace> bay, at lea&#383;t on the <i>Engli&#383;h</i> &#383;ide. It is to be remark&#8217;d that the <cdplace>river <i>Eden</i></cdplace> has of late years kept almo&#383;t clo&#383;e under the <i>Scotch</i> &#383;hore, but its cour&#383;e is con&#383;tantly varying by the rapidity of land floods at low ebbs, thro&#8217; &#383;uch a &#383;oft and &#383;limy &#383;and, that no chart can be given with certainty of its fre&#383;hwater cour&#383;e; be&#383;ides, the &#383;ands are extremely uncertain and dangerous to enter upon.</p>
   <p>At <cdplace><i>Fi&#383;hgarth</i></cdplace> I mea&#383;ur&#8217;d a fre&#383;h ba&#383;e at low ebb, to adju&#383;t <cdplace><i>Workington</i></cdplace> light-hou&#383;e, and proceeded forward by <cdplace><i>Uln</i></cdplace> or <cdplace><i>Eln</i></cdplace> foot. Maps are divided how to &#383;pell this river, but it &#383;eems mo&#383;t rea&#383;onable <cdplace><i>Uln</i></cdplace> or <cdplace><i>Ulhn</i></cdplace>, becau&#383;e above <cdplace><i>Ierby</i></cdplace>, where this water flows, the dale or valley is call&#8217;d <i>Uln-dale</i>, and the church <cdplace><i>Uln-dale</i></cdplace> church. Again from <cdplace><i>Ellenborough</i></cdplace>, near its mouth, one would be induced to write it <cdplace><i>Ellon</i></cdplace>, and &#8217;tis commonly called at its exit <cdplace><i>Eln-foot</i></cdplace>.</p>
   <p>From <cdplace><i>Eln-foot</i></cdplace> the &#383;hore is a fine hard &#383;and, and the coa&#383;t above at &#383;ome di&#383;tance high and woody, particularly above <cdplace><i>Flimby</i></cdplace>, a little village with &#383;altpans; the&#383;e woods are call&#8217;d <cdplace><i>Flimby</i></cdplace> parks, and the country a&#383;&#383;umes a better a&#383;pect.</p>
   <p>When we get to a &#383;ingle hou&#383;e call&#8217;d the <cdplace><i>Boin</i></cdplace>, the coa&#383;t elbows round, and the whole track from thence to <cdplace><i>Darwent</i> mouth</cdplace> is a low, benty &#383;oil, &#383;o broken with rabbets, that &#8217;tis almo&#383;t impo&#383;&#383;ible to ride it after night falls.</p>
   <p>The river <cdplace><i>Darwent</i></cdplace> is the &#383;econd for magnitude in <cdplace><i>Cumberland</i></cdplace>; it might be made navigable to <cdplace><i>Cockermouth</i></cdplace>, by cutting thro&#8217; &#383;ome grounds, and erecting locks; for it admits &#383;hips of tolerable burthen for coa&#383;ters to <cdplace><i>Workington</i></cdplace>.</p>
   <p><cdplace><i>Workington</i></cdplace> &#383;eems a town of pretty trade, above 50 ve&#383;&#383;les belong to it, and the harbour dilates above the pier, which breaks the extreme violence of the tides by we&#383;terly winds, and affords a good harbour; but as it lay out of my limit I pa&#383;s&#8217;d the <cdplace><i>Darwent</i></cdplace> in a boat, and proceeded to follow the cour&#383;e of the coa&#383;t. On the opposite side we came up with the light-hou&#383;e and high land which we had &#383;een for &#383;everal miles; they are principal &#383;ea-marks for <cdplace><i>Workington</i></cdplace> harbour, and the <i>Scotch</i> coa&#383;t, which appears exactly as I have drawn it.</p>
  
  <gap desc="Engraving: a topographical cross section entitled 'Appearance of How-michal chapel H, and Workington light house L, for 16 miles along the coast.'"/>

<pb n="5"/>
   <p>The land was now high again, but &#383;kirted with low, benty ground for rabbet warrens, with which the whole coa&#383;t from the <cdplace><i>Grune</i></cdplace> abounds; but makes a very bad appearance, becau&#383;e the eye is pre&#383;ently taken off by the height of the banks on your left hand, which of them&#383;elves form a very indifferent land&#383;kip.</p>
   <p>I had now lo&#383;t <cdplace><i>Skiddow</i></cdplace> and <cdplace><i>Burn&#383;wark</i></cdplace>, <cdplace><i>Criffield</i></cdplace> only remained on the <i>Scotch</i> &#383;hore, but the <cdplace><i>Isle of Man</i></cdplace> was vi&#383;ible enough, tho&#8217; the horizon was hazy, and the &#383;ea very rough.</p>
   <p>At <cdplace><i>Harrington</i></cdplace> &#383;alt pans, and before, the coa&#383;t from bad grew wor&#383;e and wor&#383;e; the rocks, or &#383;tones equal to rocks, grew in&#383;upportable for either hor&#383;e or foot. I order&#8217;d the hor&#383;es up land at the foot-ways cut from the pans along very &#383;teep, rocky brows, finding the coa&#383;t now impracticable for riding, and walk&#8217;d under the &#383;hocking precipices, where no mortal could have gone in &#383;pring tides, becau&#383;e the &#383;ea wa&#383;hes them to a great height. The &#383;ea was then full and &#383;tormy, and I often felt it &#383;prinklings, broke into drops by the violent &#383;hock upon the low rocks, on who&#383;e top was all the path we had.</p>
   <p>Both <cdplace><i>Harrington</i></cdplace> &#383;alt-pans, which are now wrought, and the old ones of <cdplace><i>Leuco</i></cdplace>, which are tumbling into ruins every &#383;pring tide, are &#383;hockingly &#383;ituated.</p>
   <p>After a fine coa&#383;t and inland, we came to <cdplace><i>Whitehaven</i></cdplace>, which is a thriving and well-built town; it exceeds <cdplace><i>Carli&#383;le</i></cdplace> in extent about &#8531;, but is thrice as populous. The &#383;treets are extremely &#383;traight and regular in mo&#383;t places; there is a general appearance of indu&#383;try among&#383;t the inhabitants, and the hurry and bu&#383;tle which accompanies their trade &#383;eems to be natural and ea&#383;y/ The va&#383;t &#383;upply of coals in this neighbourhood has rais&#8217;d this port from a fi&#383;hing town to be the next after <cdplace><i>Bri&#383;tol</i></cdplace> and <cdplace><i>Liverpool</i></cdplace> on the we&#383;t &#383;ea, and the roads leading to it are equal to the best turnpikes about <cdplace><i>London</i></cdplace>, and are every day improving, and carrying forward. Its &#383;ituation is low in compari&#383;on of the great height of the coa&#383;t on all &#383;ides of it, and the harbour is barricado&#8217;d with &#383;everal piers to bridle the fury of the we&#383;t winds, to which it is greatly expos&#8217;d. Here the country puts on a much better appearance, and a fine vale encricles <cdplace><i>Bees-head</i></cdplace> from <cdplace><i>Whitehaven</i></cdplace> to the little brook below <cdplace><i>Sea-cote</i></cdplace>, full of plea&#383;ant villages, and country &#383;eats; &#383;o that if you have no accident by the way in &#383;o long a journey, you will not repent vi&#383;iting <cdplace><i>Whitehaven</i></cdplace>.</p>
   <p>There is a &#383;mall fort at the outer pier, to command the harbour, of no great &#383;trength by &#383;ituation; there &#383;eems wanting a lower battery on their pier itself.--</p>
   <p>On the 30th we reached <cdplace><i>Bees-head</i></cdplace>, where is a light-hou&#383;e, but, in my opinion, the cradel is too much &#383;unk within the battlements to afford a &#383;erviceable light to &#383;ailors; the point indeed is &#383;o prodigiously expo&#383;ed, that a greater elevation would occa&#383;ion a far greater con&#383;umption of fire; but coals are &#383;o plentiful in this neighbourhood, the expence ought not to be regarded, as &#8217;tis the fir&#383;t land that &#383;ailors from the we&#383;t endeavour to make. They compute it 10 leagues from this promontory to the <cdplace><i>I&#383;le of Man</i></cdplace>, I make it more by connecting of triangels, to the <cdplace><i>Paps of Man</i></cdplace>, whither I took my aim.</p>
   <p>The town or village of <cdplace><i>St Bees</i></cdplace> is plea&#383;antly &#383;ituated in a vlae, where they &#383;uppo&#383;e the &#383;ea formerly flowed; here is a good free-&#383;chool, and a fine retreat for youth; it is equal to &#383;everal market towns in bigne&#383;s, but the market of <cdplace><i>Whitehaven</i></cdplace> has attracted the bu&#383;ine&#383;s, and left <cdplace><i>St Bees</i></cdplace> a village only.</p>
   <p>From hence we found the &#383;and and &#383;hingle very loo&#383;e and chaffy, which occa&#383;ions great labour to the traveller till we came to the <cdplace><i>Caldar</i></cdplace>, a &#383;tream running, thro&#8217; very romantic pro&#383;pects, into the &#383;ea, without any harbour. At about a mile di&#383;tant from <cdplace><i>Caldar</i> mouth</cdplace> is a very dangerous rock, only &#383;een at extreme low ebbs. It is called <cdplace><i>Drig-rock</i></cdplace>, and in the cour&#383;e of &#383;even years has only been ob&#383;erved twice.</p>
   <p>Here is abundance of all kinds of crabs and lob&#383;ters, and other te&#383;taceous fi&#383;h, and the large&#383;t oy&#383;ters of <cdplace><i>Britain</i></cdplace>.</p>

   <p>From <cdplace><i>Bowne&#383;s</i></cdplace> the coa&#383;t continues high for about a mile we&#383;tward to <i>How</i> point; when it falls low again, winding by <cdplace><i>Scargevil-head</i></cdplace>, till we come to <cdplace><i>Cardronac</i> bay</cdplace>, which is a very dangerous one, being full of &#383;hifting quick&#383;ands, by rea&#383;on of the rivers and land waters; the&#383;e, after rains, hurry the &#383;and into a loo&#383;e &#383;ludge, which mu&#383;t be wa&#383;h&#8217;d with &#383;everal tides before it con&#383;olidates afre&#383;h, &#383;o that no traveller, or even the inhabitants, can pa&#383;s it with certainty at all times.--</p>
   <p>This bay is by &#383;ome &#383;uppos&#8217;d the <i>Mori-cambe</i> of <i>Ptolemy</i>, but I rather think it to be <i>Ken</i> &#383;ands. There has been an old ca&#383;tle at the cote of <cdplace><i>Skinburn-naze</i></cdplace>, probably to guard the bay; a deep creek flows up to it rendering it navigable, &#383;o that brandy &#383;loops drive on a &#383;trong trade here, becau&#383;e of the impo&#383;&#383;ibility of an officer getting at them, e&#383;pecially from the <cdplace><i>Cardronac</i></cdplace> &#383;ide.</p>
   <p>On the &#383;outh of the bay lies <cdplace><i>Holm-abbey</i></cdplace>, eminent for the re&#383;idence of the princes of <cdplace><i>Scotland</i></cdplace>; it re&#383;embles the e&#383;curial in <cdplace><i>Spain</i></cdplace>, having been both a palace and a mona&#383;tery; but the de&#383;cription of <i><cdperson>Virgil&#8217;s</cdperson> <cdtitle>Tenedos</cdtitle></i> may be now applied to it.</p>

    </poem>
   
   <p>M<cdplace><i>Cardronac</i></cdplace> is an in&#383;ignificant village in a wretched country, almo&#383;t quite invironed with &#383;ea and mora&#383;&#383;es.</p> 
   <p>The <cdplace><i>Grune</i></cdplace> is a remarkable head of land, who&#383;e po&#383;ition the common maps have widely mi&#383;taken. It is now only a rabbet warren, and hardly any ve&#383;tige left where an antient chapel &#383;tood, called the chapel of the <cdplace><i>Grune</i></cdplace>; the whole is a low beachy coa&#383;t. The <i>Dutch</i> would make a gainful acqui&#383;ition by diking of this bay, was it in <cdplace><i>Holland</i></cdplace>, for the tide recedes &#383;o as one may pa&#383;s it in any place for &#383;everal hours together.</p>
   <p>From hence the coa&#383;t inclines more &#383;outherly, but is &#383;o extremely poor, that one could not meet with a &#383;ingle public hou&#383;e, or any other refre&#383;hment, from <cdplace><i>Holm-abby</i></cdplace>, where I lodg&#8217;d the fourth night, to <cdplace><i>Allonby</i></cdplace> on the coa&#383;t, where night overtook us again. This whole coa&#383;t, till you come at a hou&#383;e called <cdplace><i>Beckfoot</i></cdplace>, is full of &#383;andy hills, blown and rais&#8217;d by the winds, and are very tire&#383;ome travelling upon--</p>
   <p><cdplace><i>Allonby</i></cdplace> is grown from a petty village to have a kind of market, e&#383;pecially in the &#383;ummer; it &#383;tretches along the coa&#383;t in a &#383;traggling manner, but is tolerably well built, and has a con&#383;iderable concour&#383;e for bathing in the &#383;ea.</p>
   <p><cdplace><i>Hill-hou&#383;e</i></cdplace> is a &#383;ea-mark, becau&#383;e it &#383;tands pretty high, and is made u&#383;e of in the &#383;ame manner almo&#383;t as <cdplace><i>Dubmill-hou&#383;e</i></cdplace>, to avoid a dangerous &#383;and, which &#383;tretches almo&#383;t from <cdplace><i>Workington</i></cdplace>-bar to the <i>Scotch</i> coa&#383;t. When <cdplace><i>Howmichael</i> chapel</cdplace> and the &#383;addle on <cdplace><i>Bees head</i></cdplace> are in one line, you may avoid the <i>Swap</i>; and when <cdplace><i>Dubmill-hou&#383;e</i></cdplace> and mount <cdplace><i>Skiddow</i></cdplace> are in a line, you are on the tail of <cdplace><i>Dubmill</i></cdplace> swap, and &#383;o may turn down the <cdplace><i>Salway</i></cdplace>; &#8217;tis about half a mile broad.</p>

<pb n="292"/>
   <p>Hence we have low coa&#383;t till you pa&#383;s the <cdplace><i>Blue-dial</i></cdplace>; then the &#383;hore begins to be banky, and ri&#383;es by degrees to the <cdplace><i>Bankend</i> point</cdplace>, with a &#383;kirt of low ground under the banks, for rabbet warrens. The &#383;ea-&#383;and is full of &#383;tones, &#383;ome pretty large. On this &#383;hore I &#383;aw the &#383;tar-fi&#383;h, the concha, periwinkle, and pectines, and hardly any other kind. The coa&#383;t, all along from <cdplace><i>Skinburn-naze</i></cdplace>, is entangled with &#383;ea-holly, and very few other herbs, &#383;ave the &#383;erpyllum and re&#383;t-harrow.</p>
   <p><cdplace><i>Ravengla&#383;s</i></cdplace> is but a &#383;mall town, con&#383;i&#383;ting of a &#383;ingle row of hou&#383;es in an i&#383;thmus, &#383;o &#383;urrounded with water, that travellers are &#383;ometimes oblig&#8217;d to wait four or five hours before they can get to it, without riding almo&#383;t up to the mountains. If there was occa&#383;ion for it, a very &#383;mall matter would render it unapproachable.</p>
   <p>The <i>Perch</i> is a word us&#8217;d here for the mouth of a harbour; there is a long pole rais&#8217;d in the middle of the channel of <cdplace><i>Ravengla&#383;s</i></cdplace> harbour for a po&#383;t of direction; to &#383;uch as the&#383;e, candles and lanthorns are affix&#8217;d, for night guides in mo&#383;t places.</p>
   <p>This harbour is extremely ill repre&#383;ented in all maps; certainly no geographer has ever in&#383;pected it: Three tolerable &#383;treams empty them&#383;elves into in, who&#383;e names and cour&#383;e you have in the draught.</p>
   <p>Of all the three &#383;treams, <cdplace><i>Esk</i></cdplace> is the farthest navigable, even a great way above <cdplace><i>Moncaster hall</i></cdplace>, Sir <i>Jospeh Pennington</i>&#8217;s &#383;eat, quite to the mountains, for ve&#383;&#383;els of tolerable burthen.</p>
   <p>Notwith&#383;tanding the governement keeps a preventing officer at this town, he is &#383;o flood-lock&#8217;d that he mu&#383;t often be an idle &#383;pectator of the foul practice of &#383;muggling, without having it in his power to prevent it. &#8217;Tis &#383;urprizing, that there is not a &#383;tation boat allowed, that might enable him to go out at all times, to in&#383;pect ve&#383;&#383;els of that kind, for few others ever call here; from the &#383;ea-&#383;ide is a very &#383;hocking land&#383;kip of fells and precipices, bare and quite void of &#383;oil to we&#383;tward, as it ob&#383;erved thro&#8217; the world (<i>See vol.</i> xvii. <i>p</i>. 525.) &#383;o that whil&#383;t the ea&#383;t &#383;ide affords fine pa&#383;turage, the we&#383;t will hardly &#383;upport a goat. Amid&#383;t the&#383;e precipices, &#383;hocking as they are, many beautiful narrow vales are inter&#383;pers&#8217;d, and kept &#383;o warm, that they produce a fine breed of large cattle, contrary to the u&#383;ual custom of mountains.</p>
  <p>Had the rebels retreated this way, as was once apprehended, they mu&#383;t have peri&#383;hed for want of &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence, but they under&#383;tood the country better.</p>
  <p>Was it not for its weekly market, <cdplace><i>Ravengla&#383;s</i></cdplace> would decline; but that and the merchants of <cdplace><i>Whitehaven</i></cdplace> u&#383;eing it &#383;ometimes as a building place for ve&#383;&#383;els, becau&#383;e materials are cheaper, contribute to its pre&#383;ervation.</p>
  <p>Getting to <cdplace><i>Stubb-place</i></cdplace>, I renew&#8217;d my ob&#383;ervations to the <cdplace><i>I&#383;le of Man</i></cdplace>, and <cdplace><i>Bees-head</i></cdplace>.</p>
  <p>Under <cdplace><i>Bankend</i></cdplace> I also made ob&#383;ervations to three &#383;everal places in the <cdplace><i>Man</i></cdplace>, and three other places.</p>
  <p>I mea&#383;ured a fre&#383;h ba&#383;e line to fix <cdplace><i>Southfield</i> point</cdplace> on a very &#383;toney &#383;hore of 88 chains. Off this head a &#383;ailor a&#383;&#383;ured me that a very large &#383;tone, as big or bigger than his ve&#383;&#383;el, lies about three miles from land, bare at low ebbs, that he has &#383;een it &#383;everal times, and has &#383;ail&#8217;d very near it.</p>
