<head level="1" align="center">A DESCRIPTION OF THE LAKE AT <cdplace>KESWICK</cdplace>.</head>
<p> -- IN my way to the north from <cdplace><i>Hagley</i></cdplace> I pa&#8747;&#8747;ed thro' <cdplace><i>Dovedale</i></cdplace>; and to &#8747;ay the truth, was di&#8747;appointed in it. When I came to <cdplace><i>Buxton</i></cdplace>, I vi&#8747;ited another or two of their romantic &#8747;cenes; but the&#8747;e are inferior to <cdplace><i>Dovedale</i></cdplace>. They are but poor miniatures of <cdplace>KESWICK</cdplace>; which exceeds them more in grandeur than I can give you to imagine; and more if po&#8747;&#8747;ible in beauty than in grandeur.</p>
<p>In&#8747;tead of the narrow &#8747;lip of valley which is &#8747;een at <cdplace><i>Dovedale</i></cdplace>, you have at <cdplace>KESWICK</cdplace> a va&#8747;t amphitheatre, in circumference above twenty miles. In&#8747;tead of a meagre rivulet, a noble living lake, ten miles round, of an 
<pb n="4"/>
oblong form, adorned with variety of wooded i&#8747;lands. The rocks indeed of <cdplace><i>Dovedale</i></cdplace> are finely wild, pointed, and irregular; but the hills are both little and unanimated; and the margin of the brook is poorly edged with weeds, mora&#8747;s, and bru&#8747;hwood. -- But at <cdplace>KESWICK</cdplace>, you will, on one &#8747;ide of the lake, &#8747;ee a rich and beautiful land&#8747;kip of cultivated fields, ri&#8747;ing to the eye in fine inequalities, with noble groves of oak, happily di&#8747;per&#8747;ed; and climbing the adjacent hills, &#8747;hade above &#8747;hade, in the mo&#8747;t various and picture&#8747;que forms. On the oppo&#8747;ite &#8747;hore, you will find rocks and cliffs of &#8747;tupendous height, hanging broken over the lake in horrible grandeur, &#8747;ome of them a thou&#8747;and feet high, the woods climbing up their &#8747;teep and &#8747;haggy &#8747;ides, where mortal foot never yet approached. On the&#8747;e dreadful heights the eagles build their ne&#8747;ts: A variety of waterfalls are &#8747;een pouring from their &#8747;ummits, and tumbling in va&#8747;t &#8747;heets from rock to rock in rude and terrible magnificence: While on all &#8747;ides of this immen&#8747;e amphitheatre the lofty mountains ri&#8747;e round, piercing the clouds in &#8747;hapes as &#8747;piry and fanta&#8747;tic, as the very rocks of <cdplace><i>Dovedale</i></cdplace>. -- To this I mu&#8747;t add 
<pb n="5"/>
the freqeunt and bold projection of the cliffs into the lake, forming noble bays and promontories: In other parts they finely retire from it, and often open in abrupt cha&#8747;ms of clefts, thro' which at hand, you &#8747;ee rich and cultivated vales, and beyond the&#8747;e at various di&#8747;tances, mountain ri&#8747;ing over mountain; among which, new pro&#8747;pects pre&#8747;ent them&#8747;selves in mi&#8747;t, till they eye is lo&#8747;t in an agreeable perplexity:</p>

</poem>                                                              
<p>Were I to analy&#8747;e the two places into their con&#8747;tituent principles, I &#8747;hould tell you that the full perfection of <cdplace>KESWICK</cdplace> con&#8747;i&#8747;ts of three circum&#8747;tances, <i>Beauty</i>, <i>Horror</i>, and <i>Immen&#8747;ity</i> united; the &#8747;econd of which alone is found in <cdplace><i>Dovedale</i></cdplace>. Of beauty it hath little: Nature having left it almo&#8747;t a de&#8747;art: Neither its &#8747;mall extent, nor the diminutive and lifele&#8747;s form of the hills admit magnificence. -- But to give you a complete idea of the&#8747;e three perfections, as they are joined in <cdplace>KESWICK</cdplace>, would require the united powers of <cdperson><i>Claude</i></cdperson>, <cdperson><i>Salvator</i></cdperson>, and <cdperson><i>Pou&#8747;&#8747;in</i></cdperson>. The fir&#8747;t &#8747;hould throw his delicate &#8747;un&#8747;hine over the cultivated vales, the &#8747;cattered 
<pb n="6"/>
cots, the groves, the lake, and wooded i&#8747;lands. The &#8747;econd &#8747;hould da&#8747;h out the horror of the rugged cliffs, the &#8747;teeps, the hanging woods, and foaming waterfalls; while the grand pencil of <cdperson><i>Pou&#8747;&#8747;in</i></cdperson> &#8747;hould crown the whole with the maje&#8747;ty of the impending mountains.</p> 
<p>So much for what I would call the <i>permanent</i> beauties of this a&#8747;toni&#8747;hing &#8747;cene. Were I not afraid of being tire&#8747;ome, I could now dwell as long on its <i>varying</i> or <i>accidental</i> beauties. I would &#8747;ail round the lake, anchor in every bay, and land you on every promontory and i&#8747;land. I would point out the perpetual change of pro&#8747;pect: The woods, rocks, cliffs, and mountains, by turns vani&#8747;hing or ri&#8747;ing into view: Now gaining on the &#8747;ight, hanging over our heads in their full dimen&#8747;ions, beautifully dreadful; and now, by a change of &#8747;ituation, a&#8747;&#8747;uming new romantic &#8747;hapes, retiring and le&#8747;&#8747;ening on the eye, and in&#8747;en&#8747;ibly lo&#8747;ing them&#8747;elves in an azure mi&#8747;t. I would remark the contra&#8747;t of light and &#8747;hade, produced by the morning and evening &#8747;un; the one gilding the we&#8747;tern, and the other the ea&#8747;tern &#8747;ide of this immen&#8747;e amphitheatre; while the va&#8747;t &#8747;hadow projected by the 
<pb n="7"/>
mountains buries the oppo&#8747;ite part in a deep and purple gloom, which the eye can hardly penetrate: The natural variety of colouring which the &#8747;everal objects produce is no le&#8747;s wonderful and plea&#8747;ing: The ruling tincts in the valley being tho&#8747;e of azure, green, and gold, yet ever various, ari&#8747;ing from an intermixture of the lake, the woods, the gra&#8747;s, and corn-fields: The&#8747;e are finely contra&#8747;ted by the grey rocks and cliffs; and the whole heightened by the yellow &#8747;treams of light, the purple hues, and mi&#8747;ty azure of the mountains. Sometimes a &#8747;erene air and clear &#8747;ky di&#8747;clo&#8747;e the tops of the highe&#8747;t hills: At others, you &#8747;ee clouds involving their &#8747;ummits, re&#8747;ting on their &#8747;ides, or de&#8747;cending to their ba&#8747;e, and rolling among the vallies, as in a va&#8747;t furnace. -- When the winds are high, they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder; then, too, the clouds are &#8747;een in va&#8747;t bodies &#8747;weeping along the hills in gloomy greatne&#8747;s, while the lake joins the tumult and to&#8747;&#8747;es like a &#8747;ea: But in calm weather the whole &#8747;cene becomes new: The lake is a perfect mirror; and the land&#8747;kip in all its beauty, i&#8747;lands, fields, woods, rocks, and mountains, are &#8747;een inverted, and floating 
<pb n="8"/>
on its &#8747;urface. I will now carry you to the top of a cliff, where if you dare approach the ridge, a new &#8747;cene of a&#8747;toni&#8747;hment pre&#8747;ents it&#8747;elf, where the valley, lake, and i&#8747;lands, &#8747;eem laying at your feet; where this expan&#8747;e of water appears dimini&#8747;hed to a little pool amid&#8747;t the va&#8747;t immea&#8747;ureable objects that &#8747;urround it; for here the &#8747;ummits of more di&#8747;tant hill appear before tho&#8747;e you had already &#8747;een; and ri&#8747;ing behind each other in &#8747;ucce&#8747;&#8747;ive ranges and azure groups of craggy and broken &#8747;teeps, form an immen&#8747;e and awful picture, which can only be expre&#8747;&#8747;ed by the image of a tempe&#8747;tnous &#8747;ea of mountains. -- Let me now conduct you down again to the valley, and conclude with one circum&#8747;tance more; which is, that a walk by full moon-light (at which time the di&#8747;tant water-falls are heard in all their variety of &#8747;ound) among the&#8747;e inchanting dales, opens a &#8747;cene of &#8747;uch delicate beauty, repo&#8747;e, and &#8747;olemnity, as exceeds all de&#8747;cription.</p>
