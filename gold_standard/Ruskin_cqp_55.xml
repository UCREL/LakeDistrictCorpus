<poem>
<line>  ̎As, eagerly waiting the dawn of the day </line>
<line> And sleeplessly counting the moments, I lay, </line>
<line> I thought of the joys that my bosom should know, – </line> 
<line> Of the rich tides of pleasure unmingled which flow; – </line>
<line> Unmingled with grief, and unmingled with gall, </line>
<line> But draughts of delight, – rapture, – banquetings all! </line>
<line> Impatient I watched as the lingering light </line>
<line> Too slowly o'erpowered the clouds of the night; </line>
<line> Who clothed in her star-sprinkled heaven-shrouding vest, </line>
<line> Which gracefully mantled her e'er peaceful breast, – </line> 
<line> And while on her brows, her dark tresses among,</line>
<line> Which flowed soft, the pale crescent benignantly shone – </line>
<line> From the earth-cheering rays of Aurora she fled, </line>
<line> In stern winter's palaces hiding her head. </line>
<line> At length the time came, when, the bill being made, – </line>
<line> Boots, hostler and chambermaid all duly paid, – </line>
<line> Sticks, bonnets, hats, greatcoats, all duly prepared; – </line>
<line> Our elegant carriage rolled out of the yard! </line>
 <line> Oh, the rapturous vision! But cease this vain rhyme </line>
<line> Which not at all needed, wastes paper and time, – </line>
<line> Too lengthened and tiresome. Sufficient to say </line>
<pb n="28"/>
<line> That we entered our carriage , and rattled away </line>
<line> The road it was hilly; and long, long it seemed, </line>
<line> As one hill being past still one more intervened, </line>
<line> As opposing themselves to our still hoping eyes </line>
<line> The ne'er-ending summits successively rise, </line>
<line> Till raising our hands in admiring amaze </line>
<line> We silently enthusiastical gaze. </line>
<line> Oh, thrice happy moment, for <cdplace>Windermere's</cdplace> sheet <ptr target="n1"/> </line>
<line> In its bright, silvan beauty lay stretched at our feet! </line>
<line> Oh, had I a pen that was formed of brass,</line>
<line> That scene's softened grandeur no words could express! </line>
<line> Could I grave on a rock that was adamantine, </line>
<line> Had I the assistance and power of the Nine, </line>
<line> Oh, tell me, of what of that scene could I say, </line>
<line> What words could a partial idea convey? </line>
<line> Then let me be silent, for truly I ween </line>
<line> One word of description dishonours the scene. </line>
<line> With uplifted hands, and with praise never-ending, </line>
<line> The hill we were slowly, most slowly, descending; </line>
<line> And, feasting our eyes on the prospect before, </line>
<line> With lingering steps we are nearing the shore: </line>
<line> Until we are plunged, as we turned to the right, </line>
<line> In a wood that obscured the scene from our sight; </line>
<line> Save where some opening space for a moment revealed, </line>
<line> The scene, scarce perceived when again 'twas concealed. </line>
<line> I much love to gaze on a ven'rable wood, </line>
<line> Which for ages and centuries past may have stood, – </line>
<line> Upon oaks, with their mossy trunks gnarled and knotted, </line>
<line> Which still are majestic, decayed though and rotted; </line>
<line> While their far-spreading branches, obscuring the day </line>
<line> From the green, woody glades and the birches so grey. </line>
<line> So fair was the wood on which now we did gaze, </line>
<line> Admiring the flow'ry, moss-carpeted maze: </line>
<line> And there, a small streamlet with verdant banks sung </line>
<line> As it laughingly sported the green sward among. </line>
<pb n="29"/> 
<line> And now, as we gladly emerged from the shade, </line>
<line> The place of our halting at length we surveyed. </line>
<line> We drove to the door, and the bell it was rung, </line>
<line> And forth from the carriage impatient we sprung. </line>
<line> Our apartment was shown, – to the window we flew, – </line>
<line> But oh, what a prospect awaited our view! </line>
<line> We saw on the opposite side of the road </line> 
<line> That four lofty poplars sky-scrapingly stood; </line> 
<line> While festooning and twining their foliage among, </line>
<line> The ivy so gracefully garlanding clung. </line>
<line> They stood on a bank which the crystalline wave </line>
<line> Of the wood-skirted <cdplace>Windermere</cdplace> lightly did lave, – </line>
<line> So fresh, and so cooling, as angry it broke </line>
<line> On a pier that was formed of rough masses of rock. </line>
<line> Two barks the wave breasted, but moored by a chain, </line>
<line> In vain that wave bore them; they struggled in vain. </line>
<line> Then wandered the eye, as deserting the shore </line>
<line> It roved the dark lake and its blue mountain o'er; </line>
<line> Where the huge pikes of <cdplace>Langdale</cdplace> struck awe to the mind, </line>
<line> With their dark and dread outlines distinctly defined; </line>
<line> Where the pikes of <cdplace>Scawfell</cdplace> rose so haughty and proud <ptr target="n2"/> </line>
<line> While its battlements lofty looked down on the cloud, – </line>
<line> While its sides with ravines and dark chasms were riven, – </line> 
<line> That huge mountain wall seemed upholding the heaven! </line>
<line> And now, with our appetites sharpened and able, </line>
<line> We turned to the dinner which smoked on the table. </line>
<line> Indeed I am wrong; I the truth have not told, </line>
<line> For if I mistake not, that dinner was cold. </line>
<line> Then forth did we spring (for we found it so nice </line>
<line> That the business of eating was done in a trice). </line>
<line> We sprang to the beach, there to laugh and to play </line>
<line> And to watch the wild waves, and the scene to survey. </line>
<line> First, forth did we run to the end of the pier </line> 
<line> And there, the light wave was so limpid and clear </line>
<line> You might almost have thought that no wave intervened, </line>
<pb n="30"/>
<line> So pure and so bright and so airy it seemed. </line>  
<line> We gazed where the shoals of the minnows did glide, </line>
<line> For a casual moment exposing their side. </line>
<line> Oh, then, how they flashed – they seemed lightnings at play,</line>
<line> Desporting themselves 'neath the watery way – </line> 
<line> And, while for a moment the lustrous waves trembled, </line>
<line> Flint and steel at a boxing match much they resembled. </line>
<line> But now we were summoned away by a call </line>
<line> In order to visit a fine waterfall. <ptr target="n3"/> </line>
<line> At the banks of the lake we no longer delayed </line>
<line> But in great expectation we joyful obeyed. </line>
<line> How teeming with beauty, how fair was that road </line>
<line> As it wound round the hill, all adorned with wood; </line>
<line> Here, neath the thick moss, the wood violets grew </line>
<line> And their rich breeze-borne fragrance around them they threw </line>
<line> And there the red strawberry hung o'er the spring </line>
<line> And round the old oaks the dark ivy did cling </line>
<line> And the thrush and lark and the robin so mild </line>
<line> Were warbling their notes in their wilderness wild. </line>
<line> We listened; the rapturous harmony came, </line>
<line> And then was repeated again and again, </line>
<line> While it was the only harmonious sound </line>
<line> That broke the still silence which reigned around – </line>
<line> Save where o'er the waters the breezes did play </line>
<line> And ruffled the murmuring waves of the bay. </line>
<line> And now we arrived at the <cdplace>inn Salutation</cdplace>, </line>
<line> Being quite at a loss for terms of admiration – </line>
<line> Then turned to the right and hill 'gan ascending </line>
<line> Where the path amid copses of brushwood was bending, </line>
<line> And wound up a narrow and wooded ravine </line>
<line> Which confined with its rocks the bright waves of a stream. </line>
<line> The path it was stony, and toilsome the way, </line>
<pb n="31"/>
<line> But still perseverance shall carry the day. </line>
<line> While there from the bowels – the heart of the rock – </line>
<line> First forth to the daylight, a rivulet broke, </line>
<line> Then twinkling and dancing all over the road, </line>
<line> Found its way to the torrent beneath us which flowed, </line>
<line> While some mass of rock – some convenient stone – </line>
<line> By way of a bridge in the streamlet was thrown. </line> 
<line> But it looked so ticklish, so very suspicious, </line> 
<line> As if it intended completely to dish us – </line>
<line> To alleviate our heat by a ducking, and by </line> 
<line> A draught of the fountain our thirst t'satisfy. </line> 
<line> Though we much admire them, yet just at this time </line> 
<line> Such rock adoration we begged to decline </line>
<line> And hoped they'd excuse that, our great veneration, </line> 
<line> We did not then show by a humble prostration! </line> 
<line> And now we had climbed where a beetling brow'd rock </line>
<line> Hung sheer where the waters in angry foam broke. </line>
<line> We stepped to the edge. From the brink of the steep, </line>
<line> Low sunk a wide chasm, all dreary and deep. </line> 
<line> The mountain ash hung o'er the dark torrent's foam </line>  
<line> And the old stunted oaks frowned, all savage and lone. </line> 
<line> High in front rose a cliff, o'er whose mist-covered brow </line> 
<line> The fierce torrent dashed to the deep gulph below. </line> 
<line> Two streams, from the rock where its head overhung. </line>
<line> In lines of bright silvery foaming they sprung, </line>   
<line> Then, rushed 'gainst a crag, where in midway it stood, </line>
<line> And opposed its dark sides to the force of the flood, </line>
<line> United with back-beaten force from it leapt, </line>
<line> And indignantly down dashing dreadful it swept – </line>
<line> All wreathed with snow and all chafed by the rock, </line>
<line> 'Twas received in the basin which yawned at its foot. </line>
<line> Forth dancing so gaily the bright waters flowed, </line>
<line> While the masses of foam on its surface yet rode – </line>
<line> Then, confined mid the stones, all so lightly they danced </line>
<line> And, leaping and sporting, they frothily glanced </line>
<pb n="32"/>
<line> And their murmurs were sounding full softly and lone </line>
<line> As mantling in basins of moss-covered stone. </line>
<line> And now, when our sight we had well satisfied, </line>
<line> And had gazed enough on the fierce boiling tide, </line>
<line> Towards <cdplace>Lowwood</cdplace> once more we our footsteps did bend </line>
<line> And the rough mountain path we began to descend. </line>
<line> Soon reached we the shore, where a scene we descry </line>
<line> That baffles description and dazzles the eye – </line>
<line> The sun, ere his glory away should be past, </line>
<line> On the brows of the mountain was shining his last – </line>
<line> The bright western clouds their rough outlines unfold, </line> 
<line> Relieving their splendour and graven in gold. </line> 
<line> Methought little space 'tween those hills intervened, </line>
<line> But nearer – more lofty – more shaggy they seemed; </line>
<line> The clouds, o'er their summits they calmly did rest, </line>
<line> And hung on the aether's invisible breast. </line>
<line> Than the vapours of earth, they seemed purer, more bright. </line>
<line> Oh, could they be clouds? 'Twas the necklace of night! </line>
<line> Then, we looked on the lake, where the deep crimson ray </line>
<line> Shot its light on the waters, as bloody they play. </line>
<line> It seemed as if autumn had given its tint </line>
<line> To the woods which the lake's splendid ripples did fringe, </line>
<line> And the islands on which that bright rippling rolled. </line>
<line> They seemed as if lashed by the pure liquid gold. </line>
<line> Oh such was the scene which in glory reposed. </line>
<line> But soon by the evening its splendour was closed. </line>
<line> Ere we reached our home, the dark shades of the night </line>
<line> Descending, had hidden the hills from our sight. </line>
<line> They died in the mists of the darkness away </line>
<line> To be waked into light at the dawn of the day. </line>
<line> And now being tired, we soon hurried to bed </line>
<line> And on the soft pillow we rested our head. </line>
<line> Soon, soon, we were plunged in forgetfulness sweet </line>
<line> And, gladly, we sunk in th' oblivion of sleep </line>
<line> Which fluttered with Lethean dews all around </line>
 <pb n="33"/>
<line> And fanned his grey wings with a soft lulling sound. </line>
<line> He poured on our temples those rich dews of rest </line>
<line> And folded us round with his thought-killing vest. </line>
<line> And, there as he hung on his wings, he infused </line>
<line> His dreamings of pleasure – of pleasure confused. </line>
<line> Thus, thus on our pillow we carelessly lay </line>
<line> While the hours unperceived, floated lightly away. </line>
<line> So soon as the clouds of heaven were borne </line> 
<line> Away into the distance at grey of the morn, </line>
<line> We sprang to the shore. Now so calm was the lake </line>
<line> We thought that with pleasure a sail we might take, </line>  
<line> So, calling the boatman, leaping into the boat </line>
<line> And with pulling and pushing we set her afloat </line>
<line> And deserting the pier, then, for fear of a souse </line>
<line> Sat down in the boat and were still as a mouse. </line>
<line> But our tongues, never ceasing, we did exercise – </line>
<line> And also made very good use of our eyes. </line> 
<line> Of this place, and that, of the boatman inquiring </line>
<line> And the name of this mountain, that island desiring! </line>
<line> The boatman, – Oh he had a fine Roman phiz; </line> 
<line> Strong muscular arms and rough red locks were his </line>
<line> To each question we asked, his replyings upon it </line>
<line> Were so short and so pithy – so very laconic! </line>
<line> One I know ('Tis a pity that I have forgot 'em) </line>      
<line>  ̎Can you swim? ̎  ̎Like a stone sir, not far from the bottom ̎ </line>
<line>  ̎The number of th' islands of the lake do you know? ̎ </line>
<line>  ̎A' well sir, I think 'tis about so and so ̎ </line>
<line> However we all thought him an excellent creature </line>
<line> Because we all found him so full of good nature; </line>
<line> And at present he pulled on our boat with a force </line>
<line> That sent it away like a shaft on its course. </line>
<line> As it cut through the mirror of waters below, </line>
<line> The ripples, divided, fly back from the bow, </line>
<line> Wave following wave in a far stretching wake </line>
<pb n="34"/>
<line> And partially ruffled the glass bosomed lake. </line>
<line> The boat, at each pull of the oar, with a leap </line>
<line> Sprung confident forth on the dark, heaving, deep. </line>
<line> We marked o'er the waters each breeze which might play </line>	
<line> By the light little heavings attending its way. </line>	
<line> So fresh and so smoothly o'er th' surface we fly, </line>	
<line> While each woody headland seemed darting us by; </line>
<line> Each rock and each island deserting its place </line>	
<line> With shore and with mountain seemed joining the race. </line>
<line> Here some little pleasure-boat spreading its sail, </line>
<line> Was courting the breath (but in vain) of the gale; </line>
<line> Still, it remained, unmoved, by the shore </line>
<line> And lazily floated, till urged by the oar </line>
<line> But now we bethought ourselves that a lake-sail, </line>
<line> To satisfy hunger, completely would fail </line>
<line> And as baulked of our breakfast we'd look very queer; </line>
<line> In order to get it, straight homewards we steer. </line>
<line> Now reader, thou think'st that when pure mountain air, </line>
<line> Yet breathing of heaven, played soft through our hair </line>
<line> And health fresh infusing in every part </line>
<line> And bracing the limbs and en-nerving the heart, </line>
<line> When mountains on mountains successively rise, </line>
<line> When the eye, at each pull, some new beauty descries, </line>
<line> When we swept o'er the waters for mile after mile, </line>
<line> To think of our breakfast, thou sayest, was vile. </line>
<line> But reader, consider that keen bracing breeze – </line>
<line> You forget that its sharpness will hunger increase; </line>
<line> Besides that our breakfast we hastened to seize on </line>
<line> There was a complete and efficient reason </line>
<line> Which will satisfy you, I'm sure, when 'tis known. </line>
<line> 'Twas gallantry and sympathy hurried us home. </line>
<line> Would you leave a lady, and muffins all hot too, </line>
<line> There waiting and wondering where we had got to? </line>
<line> If thou wouldst, I thee pity, but reason no more </line>
<line> With one who would waiting keep ladies on shore. </line>
<pb n="35"/>
<line> And now at the bottom the sand did appear, </line>
<line> As our boat's arching prow to the beach became near. </line>
<line> Then stopping, the boatman relinquished his oar </line>
<line> And, catching a post, drew us in to the shore, </line>
<line> Then we sprang from our seats.  ̎Oh now do have a care – </line>
<line> Mind that oar, if you please, and now step across there. ̎ </line> 
<line> Then, swift on the sand we impatiently spring </line>
<line> And run across the road and then enter the inn – </line>
<line> Then sat down where the urn on the table was hissing, </line>
<line> And nought that could add to our comfort was missing. </line>
<line> So soon as the teapot and toast rack and tray </line>
<line> By the maid from the table were carried away, </line>
<line> We hastened the lake and the beach to, once more, </line>
<line> To take our farewell of that joybringing shore – </line>
<line> That place fraught with pleasure, we so much admired </line> 
<line> That again it to visit, much much we desired, </line>  
<line> And so that our beds might not want a good warming, </line>
<line> To our host, of our coming again, we gave warning. </line>
<line> And now to our carriage proceeded we slow – </line> 
<line> The landlady curtsied, the landlord bowed low; </line>
<line> Then loudly the driver his long whip did crack </line>
<line> And gently he touched up his steeds with a smack. </line>
<line> Off swiftly we trundled and round went the wheels </line>
<line> And the horses they kicked up the dust with their heels. </line> 
<line> So flew we – but with us, ah, flew not our mind. </line>
<line> 'Twas lingering yet with fair <cdplace>Low Wood</cdplace> behind. </line>
<line> So, mournfully forward pursued we our ride </line>
<line> And still looking back till we reached <cdplace>Ambleside</cdplace>. <ptr target="n4"/> </line>
<line> And there, having passed by a bridge o'er the stream </line>
<line> Whose fierce tumbling tide at the fall we had seen, </line>
<line> There still we continued our mind-charming route, </line>
<line> Still winding and turning and twisting about, </line>
<line> Still changing in scenes, but in beauty the same, </line>
<line> Until to the village of <cdplace>Rydal</cdplace> we came. <ptr target="n5"/> </line>
<line> Wound round <cdplace>Rydal Head</cdplace>, as enormous it stood. <ptr target="n6"/> </line>
<pb n="36"/>
<line> All bulky and grim on the edge of the flood <ptr target="n7"/> </line>
<line> Which still at its base all spray-tossing did play, </line>
<line> Still sounding and rolling for ever and aye. </line>
<line> And now towards the green banks of <cdplace>Grasmere</cdplace> we prest, <ptr target="n8"/> </line>
<line> Where it stretched 'mid the valley its hill-shaded breast. </line>
<line> And now, – as ere evening concluded the day </line>
<line> Our journey o'er many a wild mountain lay, – </line>
<line> At the inn which is built on the banks of the lake </line>
<line> We determined our luncheon or dinner to take. </line>
<line> But, in order that we to the inn might attain, </line>
<line> We were forced to turn down by a long narrow lane. </line>
<line> But it twisted and turned so, to left and to right, </line>
<line> With its hedges obscuring the inn from our sight, </line>
<line> That we, all its troublesome windings not knowing, </line>
<line> Were all the time wondering where we were going! </line>
<line> But fears which were quite of a different kind </line>
<line> Were intruding and pushing themselves on our mind. </line>
<line> Suppose in our way that a carriage should come, – </line>
<line> The road was so narrow! – what then should be done? </line>
<line> Then 'twas certain and sure that one of us must back. </line>
<line> Back? – back! – why we <i>might</i> have backed into the lake! </line>
<line> What should we say then to Miss Fortune so fickle? </line>
<line> Then truly she'd have put us into a pickle! </line>
<line> But these accidents only existed in thought, </line>
<line> For safely and soon to the inn we were brought. </line>
<line> And now an excursion we thought we would make, </line>
<line> A view of the lake and the valley to take; </line>
<line> So inquiring the way to a small elevation, </line>
<line> Whose summit we thought a most excellent station, </line>
<line> We set off by a path 'mid the valley which wound, </line>
<line> And now some small eminence carried around, </line>
<line> Till after some puzzling we came to the rock </line>
<line> And swiftly climbed up to the trees on its top. </line>
<line> First, we gazed where <cdplace>Helm Crag</cdplace> to the west of the vale <ptr target="n9"/> </line>
<pb n="37"/>
<line> Reared its cloud-splitting head, and lower'd down on the dale, </line>
<line> While its dark shadow shaded the fields at its feet, </line>
<line> Made the cornfields wave browner and darkened the deep; </line>
<line> But the terrified eye, now deserting its form – </line>
<line> The abode of the tempest, the [pris'n] of the storm – </line>
<line> To the fields of the valley beneath is would rove, </line> 
<line> Which seemed sacred to peace, and to heaven-born love; </line>
<line> Where the husbandman's labours repair him tenfold, </line>
<line> All rich in their wavings and growing in gold; </line>
<line> And their grain-loaded heads, as they bent to the breeze, </line>
<line> Seemed soft, rolling waters and billowy seas. </line>
<line> And the cattle repose on the meadows so green </line>
<line> With the sound of the streams through the fields that are flowing; </line>
<line> Till the valley was checked by the opposite hills </line>
<line> All dotted with sheep and all sparkling with rills: </line>
<line> While far to the south, the lake spreads its fair waves, </line>
<line> And the meadows which stoop to its edges it laves. </line>
<line> And now, when the prospect we all had surveyed, </line>
<line> A descent we remembered at last must be made. </line>
<line> And although we had lingered and stayed to the last, </line>
<line> We addressed ourselves now to the troublesome task; </line>
<line> But whenever our steps we were carefully bending </line>
<line> Oh! still that mossed path was as steep in descending, – </line>
<line> So half rolling, half going – half tumbling, half walking, – </line>
<line> Half laughing, half giggling – half tittering, half talking – </line>
<line> Now surveying a streamlet, now mineralizing, – </line> 
<line> Now admiring the mountains, and now botanizing, – </line>
<line> We came to the inn; and set off when we'd dined </line>
<line> And ascending a hill we left <cdplace>Grasmere</cdplace> behind. </line>
<pb n="38"/>
<line> And ascending, beheld on <cdplace>Helm's</cdplace> storm-riven top </line> 
<line> Some fanciful forms which were graved on the rock. </line>
<line> 'Twas nature's own sculpturing! First there was seen </line>
<line> A hag – cow'ring low, aged, wrinkled and lean – </line>
<line> As stooping and shiv'ring before some small fire, </line>
<line> A witch is repeating her orgies so dire, </line>
<line> While many a deep furrow her sunken-cheek sears, </line>
<line> But furrows that never were graven by tears. </line>
<line> Deep-sunken her eye and dishevelled her hair, </line>
<line> Whose ragged red tresses float wild on the air. </line>
<line> Every nerve, every vein, seen distinctly within </line>
<line> And her gaunt, fleshless bones, almost bursting her skin, </line>
<line> She sees in the embers, before her which smoke, </line>
<line> The skeleton forms she is used to invoke – </line>
<line> And fiends with their lashes and scorpion-stings </line>
<line> And birds of the night scarcely fluttering their wings, </line>
<line> So wrinkled and aged the rocky hag cower'd </line>
<line> So stopped, so seemed shiv'ring, so frowningly lower'd. </line>
<line> And near seemed a lamb, a young lamb of the flock – </line>
<line> Seemed, though rather gigantic, to lie on the rock; </line>
<line> While before it, a lion, most calm did repose </line> 
<line> And graciously stooped his most royal-formed nose. </line>
<line> Thus beholding the lion, the lamb and the hag </line>
<line> In fanciful shape upon Helm's rugged crag, </line>
<line> We left the fair <cdplace>Grasmere's</cdplace> luxuriant vale </line>
<line> And gazed upon <cdplace>Leathes Water's</cdplace> mountainous dell, <ptr target="n10"/> </line>
<line> Where the beauteous, gigantic, terrific, sublime – </line>
<line> One awful view forming, all, all, did combine. </line>
<line> One thing in the prospect alone us did bore, – </line>
<line> A tedious hill lay our noses before, – </line> 
<line> Up-turning, long, tedious, and toilsome, but yet </line>
<line> We surveyed it, half joying and not with regret, – </line>  
<line> For our slowly ascending its windings, we knew, </line>
<line> Must give us more time for beholding its view. </line>
<line> And so, of our horses to lighten the load, </line>
<pb n="39"/>
<line> From our carriage dismounting, walk on, on the road, </line>
<line> And gazing around upon every quarter, </line>
<line> And now to the mountains and now to the water – </line>
<line> First, the giant <cdplace>Helvellyn</cdplace> arose on my right, – </line>
<line> <cdplace>Helvellyn</cdplace>, <cdplace>Helvellyn</cdplace> – that mountain of might! </line>
<line> Peaked rocks, over dark, gloomy gorges impending, – </line>
<line> And a torrent down every ravine was descending. </line>
<line> Cloud-born o'er the precipice stern they did break, </line>
<line> And, tumultuously foaming, were lost in the lake; </line>
<line> Appearing, as brightly they dashed from on high,</line>
<line> Like threads of pure silver which hung from the sky. </line>
<line> Midway on the face of the cliff the clouds rode; </line> 
<line> High above rose the mountain, the eagles' abode. </line>
<line> That barren, bare, grassless and heatherless steep </line>
<line> Scarce afforded subsistence to some scattered sheep; </line>
<line> On the top of the mountain they dizzily hung </line>
<line> And wandered the clouds and the peaked rocks among, </line>
<line> And carelessly scrambled from height unto height, – </line>
<line> Regardless of everything, saving a bite. </line> 
<line> On that earth-scorning mountain, astonished we gaze </line>
<line> And are silent in wonder, in dread and amaze. </line>
<line> Let other folks talk of the famous <cdplace>Parnassus</cdplace>, </line>
<line> The poetical hill of poetical asses; </line>
<line> One can rhyme without being <cdplace>Parnassus</cdplace> upon </line>
<line> And spin lines, although shut from the famed <cdplace>Helicon</cdplace>. </line>
<line> <cdplace>Helvellyn</cdplace>, – my mountain it ever shall be, – </line>
<line> The ancient <cdplace>Parnassus</cdplace> is nothing to me. </line>
<line> Let them talk about Ida, so sacred to love; </line>
<line> I care not for Juno nor old daddy Jove. </line>
<line> Though celestial breezes around it be swelling, </line>
<line> Old Ida cannot be compared to Helvellyn. </line>
<line> Besides, I will prove that it was not so high. </line>
<line> On Ida, descended the gods from the sky, </line>
<line> But then, you'll remember, the clouds were their bowers – </line>
<line> And <cdplace>Helvellyn</cdplace>, far far over all vapour towers, – </line>
<pb n="40"/>
<line> So unless they'd ascended to get to its top </line>
<line> Ten to one but their car would have bumped on a rock! </line>
<line> But I am afraid that this too-long digression, </line>
<line> On your patience, is making a hugeous transgression. </line>
<line> And now I shall prove your conjectures are wrong </line>
<line> In thinking I never am going to go on! </line>
<line> The dark narrow <cdplace>Thirlmere</cdplace> lay low at our feet; </line>
<line> The huge hills reposed on the face of the deep. </line>
<line> Far, far 'neath its waters inverted they stood, </line>
<line> And rolled o'er their imaged summits the flood. </line>
<line> We could scarcely imagine the lake there to flow, </line>
<line> And waters to roll and to murmur below </line>
<line> So smooth and so glassy the lake, that beneath </line>
<line> A deep rocky valley we seemed to perceive. </line>
<line> So distinctly reflected the margin so green, </line> 
<line> The wave seemed unbounded – its border unseen: </line> 
<line> And, half over-hanging the silent, blue tide, </line>
<line> The opposite hills stretched their heath-covered side. </line>
<line> How bright, – how luxuriant, looked the thick heath, </line>
<line> Its rich purple bells as 'twas bending beneath, </line>
<line> Its patches rich shaded with fern as it grew, </line>
<line> And mantled the hill with is (its?) Tyrian hue. </line>
<line> While beyond, a dark chaos of mountains was tost, </line>
<line> And hills after hills in the distance were lost: </line>
<line> While the sun, ere he died on the mountains away, </line>
<line> Was shedding its brightest, – but transient – ray. </line> 
<line> Now reaching our carriage, with lingering look, </line>
<line> Of <cdplace>Helvellyn</cdplace> and <cdplace>Thirlmere</cdplace> our farewell we took; </line>
<line> By rock and by brooklet swift galloping on, </line>   
<line> And holding our course by the <cdplace>Vale of St. John</cdplace>, </line>
<line> As the sun was just setting, and late was the time, </line>
<line> We hastened tall <cdplace>Castlerig's</cdplace> windings to climb. </line>
<line> As some people say, I believe it is true – </line>
<line> Though its presence I can't say that I ever knew – </line>
<line> A druidical temple is built on its top, </line>
 <pb n="41"/> 
<line> A circle of nature-hewn masses of rock. </line> 
<line> Upon admiration these may have some claims, </line>
<line> As the buildings of old and ancestral remains </line>
<line> When each savage lived free and fierce and unknown, </line>
<line> The wild his dominion, the forest his home. </line>
<line> I revere and I honour a temple, as such, </line>
<line> And gazing in wonder admire it full much,– </line> 
<line> But I care not at all for a great set of stones </line>
<line> Which are bidding you always beware of your bones, </line>
<line> For fear of a tumble! Although very fine things, </line>
<line> I think some great giant was playing at ninepins,– </line>
<line> And leaving the place, ere his ball he could swing, </line>
<line> Has left all his ninepins stuck up in a ring! </line>
<line> And now we arrived at the brow of the hill, </line>
<line> Where the vast vale of <cdplace>Keswick</cdplace> lay sweetly and still. </line>
<line> To the right, on the north of the valley, we saw </line>
<line> The majestical form of the lofty <cdplace>Skiddaw</cdplace>, </line>
<line> Where he high his huge summit indignantly heaped; </line>
<line> Twin points clove the heavens and doubly 'twas peaked. </line> 
<line> A ravine with rocks shaded, all gloomy and black, sir, </line>
<line> Divided his side from the huge <cdplace>Saddleback</cdplace>, sir. </line>
<line> O dear! what a name 'tis so clownish and fusty, </line>
<line> Like an old dirty saddle, – all musty and dusty. </line>
<line> Yet the mountain, in shape, is exactly a saddle, – </line>
<line> Delightfully suited for a riding a-straddle, </line>
<line> Good exercise giving, for as it is said, </line>
<line> 'Tis quite admirable for stretching ones leg. </line>
<line> I believe it was there, as the story it goes, </line>
<line> A quaker was half eaten up by the crows. </line>
<line> Oh! The royal birds' pardon most humbly I beg, – </line>
<line> 'Tis certain that thing that I should not have said. </line> 
<line> Oh, how could I mention a carrion bird? </line>
<line> Why blotted the paper so vulgar a word? </line>
<line> Thou great thunder-bearer, who skimmest on high – </line> 
<line> Great Jove's lightning messenger stemming the sky, – </line>
<pb n="42"/>
<line> Let thy keen, piercing eye not perceive the expression. </line> 
<line> Look down from thy mountain, forgive the transgression </line>
<line> And if you will pardon most graciously me, </line>
<line> I ascribe will, the murder, proud Eagle, to thee! </line>
<line> In a proud amphitheatre, – mountainous, – dread, </line>
<line> Below us fair <cdplace>Derwent</cdplace> in glory was spread. </line>
<line> And rocky isles covered with verdure, and bays, </line>
<line> And capes jutting out, and on forests we gaze, </line>
<line> Which relieved the dark mountains in distance and gloom, </line>
<line> And chasms as deep and as drear as the tomb. </line>
<line> Now on rugged <cdplace>Grassmoor</cdplace> the red sun dies away </line> 
<line> And evening comes down with her mantle of grey. </line> 
<line> Full gladly we entered the inn, <cdplace>Royal Oak</cdplace>, </line>
 <line> And ordered our tea, – which we hastily took, </line>
<line> Then prostrated ourselves before Morpheus' shrine </line>
<line> And straight we were lost in a slumber supine. </line>

<poem>
<line> When breakfast was done on the following day, </line>
<line> As impatient we were <cdplace>Derwent Lake</cdplace> to survey, </line>
<line> We determined a walk to its banks we would take, </line>
<line> And therefore enquired the way to the lake. </line>
<line> Though the Sun, in his noon and meridian glory, </line>
<line> Was seeming to tell us a different story; </line>
<line> And that, if we attempted to walk to the lake, </line>
<line> Our faces he'd broil and our hands he would bake. </line>
<line> Till too much oppressed and enraged with the heat, </line>
<line> In its bosom we'd souse with an unlucky leap, </line>
<line> For his threatenings we did not a fiddlestick care </line>
<line> And astonished we were how at all he could dare. </line>
<line> We bade him his heat, keep it all to himself; </line>
<line> We'd evade him by force or evade him by stealth, – </line>
<line> We shelter would seek on some wood-shaded place, </line>
<line> Or pop up some green parasols in his face, </line>
<line> Or, if uninterrupted continual he shined, </line>
<line> Why then, all his roastings we'd not at all mind, – </line> 
<pb n="52"/>
<line> For we would not, for anything stay from our ramble, – </line>
<line> So thou, proud, haughty Sun, let thy majesty tremble. </line>
<line> Now on by a path through the meadows we stray, </line>
<line> All rich with the fragrance of newly mown hay; </line>
<line> Each out-racing the other, with much emulation </line> 
<line> To arrive at the top of some small elevation; </line>
<line> Till the sheet where the dark water still onward flows </line>
<line> Lay not at our feet but in front of our nose. </line>
<line> A shout burst from all, while each one of us strove, </line>
<line> We had first seen the blue billow rolling to prove, – </line>
<line>  ̎I first saw the lake!  ̎ –  ̎No, no, no! It was I!  ̎ </line>
<line> Till mamma checked us all with a mum-making  ̎fie!  ̎ </line>
<line> We stood on the beach whence some small piers of stone </line>
<line> Forth into the water some distance were thrown; </line>
<line> While a fleet of small boats there at anchorage hung, </line>
<line> And, dividing the ripples, they carelessly swung. </line>
<line> But there on the beach, – and with shame be it said! – </line>
<line> Some women were washing – Oh women indeed! – </line>
<line> Disfiguring the <cdplace>Derwent</cdplace>, their linen were washing, </line>
<line> And tubbing, and wetting, and splashing, and dashing. </line>
<line> Then hung them all out on the boughs to be dried, </line>
<line> And clothed with a margin of linen the tide! </line>
<line> Oh Jupiter! dost thou in calmness yet see? </line>
<line> Are the shores of the <cdplace>Derwent</cdplace> as nothing to thee? </line>
<line> Do these women not yet feel thy well-deserved rage? </line>
<line> Oh, Jupiter, thou must be blinded with age! </line>
<line> Blind? Yes, quite stark blind from the length of thy life, </line>
<line> Or opposing they scolds of thy crabbèd old wife. </line>
<line> It is a complete, a most excellent sign </line>
<line> That the all-seeing eye, it no longer is thine. </line>
<line> But give, Jove, oh, give thy great, God-shaking frown, </line>
<line> And let on these women thine anger come down! </line>
<line> And now, having passed through a sun-shading wood, </line>
<line> On a point of rough rocks o'er the water we stood. </line>
<line> The roots of the fir, of the elm, and the oak, </line>
<pb n="53"/>
<line> Through the rock-covering soil they a passage had broke; </line>
<line> And oh! they presented such nets for the toes, </line>
<line> We were always in danger of breaking our nose. </line>
<line> Below us, upon the dark wave-beaten rock, </line>
<line> The white, angry billows their foaming crests broke, </line>
<line> As soothing the ear with a ne'er-ceasing dashing, </line>
<line> And moistening the moss and the weeds with their 'plashing. </line>
<line> And now some small height we did wish to attain, </line> 
<line> A view of the lake and the valley to gain: </line>
<line> And so, in returning, turned off by a way </line>
<line> Which we thought tow'rd a tree-covered eminence lay. </line>
<line> It entered a wood; we still kept going on, </line>
<line> Completely shut out from the light of the sun. </line>
<line> No part of the scene the confusèd eye sees, </line>
<line> Save copses on copses, and trees upon trees: </line>
<line> Till, the path in the forest bewild'ring tost, </line>
<line> All points of the compass completely were lost: </line>
<line> North, east, west, or south, from each other not knowing, </line> 
<line> With all kinds of conjectures how, where we were going, </line>
<line> Although it afforded a great deal of fun. </line>
<line>  ̎We shall find soon a path through the meadows,  ̎ says one – </line> 
<line>  ̎Lawkadaisy, that bough nearly knocked off my hat!  ̎ – </line>
<line> One of us says this, and another says that: </line>
<line>  ̎We are nearing the lake or at an'rate we ought to be! ̎ </line>
<line> ̎Well, I declare that a most excellent thought to be! ̎ </line>
<line> Thus wond'ring, we, serpent-like, twisted about, </line>
<line> Till just where we got in, 'twas just there we got out. </line>
<line> And we this occurrence determined quite by </line>
<line> Not any more by-paths uncertain to try. </line>
<line> We left the fair lake where, so azure, it flowed, </line>
<line> And hotly set off by the <cdplace>Borrowdale</cdplace> road; </line>
<line> And laughing, and chafing, and gazing, and toiling, </line>
<line> Perspiring and frying, and roasting, and broiling, </line>
<pb n="54"/>
<line> Glad, gladly the sheltering wood we surveyed, </line>
<line> Which promised to cool and to soothe with its shade. </line>
<line> The track it was steep, thorny, rugged, and rocky, </line>
<line> As it angled and turned around the oak trees so knotty. </line>
<line> Some, decaying, were but a vast, gray, hollow shell; </line>
<line> Of former young grandeur and might they did tell: </line>
<line> And the soil which hung thick round their huge roots far-spreading </line>
<line> Formed steps, trunk-supported, where'er we were treading. </line>
<line> We pulled up the hill, and we turned round about, </line>
<line> And we crossed and we recrossed within and without; </line>
<line> To all parts of the wood we full pryingly rambled, </line>
<line> Over stone, over rock, we impatiently scrambled. </line>
<line>  ̎Oh, we shall not get up to the summit this hour! ̎ – </line>
<line>  ̎Oh, mamma, I have got such a beautiful flow'r; </line>
<line> Here's a violet! Look, mamma! Pray, papa, do! </line>
<line> What is this of rich crimson? This delicate blue? </line>
<line> This moss of a bright living green do behold! </line>
<line> And here is a cowslip, the goblet of gold! </line>
<line> Look under the moss there, it cannot be sage! </line>
<line> What can that queer thing be?  ̎ –  ̎ 'Tis a saxifrage, ̎ </line>
<line>  ̎And here's Ladies Slipper, and here's Ladies-smock </line>
<line> And this, ̎ –  ̎Oh don't touch it, 'tis poison, – Hemlock! ̎ </line>
<line> And many more flowers 'mid the forest which grew, </line>
<line> Whose names I've forgot, – or perhaps never knew! </line>
<line> Now the rocks gave us rather more trouble to climb, </line>
<line> And rather more labour, and took us more time, </line>
<line> For the slippery moss always set us a-sliding, </line>
<line> Insomuch that we could not at all it confide in: </line>
<line> Except where, in velvet cushions, it grows, </line>
<line> And kindly invited our rock-fatigued toes. </line> 
<line>  ̎These troublesome stones – I am always a-stumbling! ̎ </line>
<line>  ̎Hollo, what's that there? I was nearly a-tumbling! ̎ </line>
<line>  ̎What, do not you think we the summit are near? ̎ </line>
<line>  ̎Oh, give my your hand, – do pray help me up here! ̎ </line>
<pb n="55"/>
<line> Till, emerging from under a thick, stunted tree, </line>
<line> An old rotten seat on the summit we see </line>
<line> The people before to this summit who came </line>
<line> Had carved, or had hacked, on its surface their name, </line>
<line> And had covered the seat with no spaces between each, </line>
<line> Oh, mighty conceit, – so like cockneys at <cdplace>Greenwich</cdplace>! </line>
<line> But 'twas so decrepid, so old and decayed, – </line>
<line> To trust to its legs we were somewhat afraid; </line>
<line> Lest, tumbling as if they had sat upon wheels, </line>
<line> It had landed our heads in the place of our heels. </line>
<line> So some on a rock that was cushioned with moss, </line>
<line> And some on the June-tinted brown turf repose; </line>
<line> Stretched out upon earth's verdant bosom we rest, </line>
<line> But tear her young flowers from her nourishing breast, </line>
<line> Which forth to our hands she luxuriantly poured – </line> 
<line> Thou sayest that it was but a cruel reward! </line> 
<line> The scene which we saw, I so often shall treat of </line>
<line> 'Twould be needless, at present, its beauties to speak of! </line>
<line> But time flew away on the wings of the wind </line>
<line> While still at the summit, we lingered behind. </line>
<line> Oh, the rogue! How I do wish that catch him I could; </line>
<line> I'd teach him to fly slower, – ay that I would! </line>
<line> Before I would let him from my finger slip, </line>
<line> That he might not be able, his wings I would clip! </line>
<line> I'd give him a wig, and in case that the wig fail, </line>
<line> In order to catch him, I'd give him a pigtail! </line>
<line> But 'twould be a fine thing, oh I should be blythe </line>
<line> If I could but snatch, from his fingers, the scythe. </line>
<line> Oh, what the ladies say unto me then, </line>
<line> And what the old women, and what would the men? </line>
<line> The ladies no longer regard would each hour, </line>
<line> If over their beauty old Time had no pow'r; </line>
<line> And, even the men, if they young could appear, – </line>
<line> They would not (so much at least) growing old fear! </line>
<line> And I do believe that, when he once he found out, </line>
<pb n="56"/>
<line> That his coming or going none minded about, </line>
<line> And that for his presence, there cared not a lump any, – </line>
<line> That really, he'd give us much more of his company! </line>
<line> However, we gladly the hill stumbled down </line>
<line> And onwards we galloped, in haste, to the town, </line>
<line> And sheltered our heads from the sun's burning ray </line>
<line> In the <cdplace>Royal Oak's</cdplace> parlour the rest of the day. </line>
<line> But the weather, how terribly much 'twas to blame </line>
<line> When the next morning's dawning proved heavy with rain, – </line>
<line> But a proof to the show'rs, of their weakness, to gi'e 'em, – </line> 
<line> We determined to step into <cdplace>Crosthwaite's Museum</cdplace>. </line>
<line> And scrambled we first up an old fashioned stair, </line>
<line> All Indian weapons and paddles were there; </line>
<line> I am sure no description is needed of these </line>
<line> For in every museum, some of them one sees. </line>
<line> But the thing which our eyes, upon entering, struck </line>
<line> Was a hugeous, gigantical, rib-bone, hung up! </line>
<line> <cdperson>Mr. Crosthwaite</cdperson> took plenty of pain to explain </line>
<line> This prodigy to be a fossil remain. </line>
<line> He told us (believe it or not as you can), </line>
<line> 'Twas the bone (or it had been the bone) of a man! – </line>
<line> And 'twas proved, and that by a good calculation, </line>
<line> That twenty one feet had been his elevation! </line>
<line> Imagine the fellow! – just staggering along </line>
<line> Like a moving church-steeple, parading it on. </line>
<line> I do not know what kind of monsters were then – </line>
<line> Perhaps they were all Brobdignagian men! </line>
<line> But imagine him taking a walk in the street, – </line>
<line> For the lovers of wonders, oh, then what a treat! </line>
<line> I think he would first play the notable trick </line>
<line> Of the Monument taking for his walking stick, – </line>
<line> And an omnibus next, kicking o'er with his toe, </line>
<line> Exclaim in stentorian accents,  ̎Hullo! </line>
<pb n="57"/>
<line> These troublesome stones. 'Tis a terrible pity </line>
<line> They have paved, so tremendously badly, the city! ̎ </line> 
<line> But the reader, he will not have patience to read </line>
<line> These nonsensical frolics, and I must proceed </line>
<line> To a gong, which on high, from the roof was suspended, </line>
<line> Whose noise, we all thought never was to be ended. </line>
<line> I think that as hard as a stone was his pate, </line>
<line> And as deaf as a post was <cdperson>Mr Crosthwaite</cdperson>! </line>
<line> For he thwacked, and he whacked, and he beat, and he bang'd, </line>
<line> And the gong in our ear so incessantly clang'd, – </line>
<line> Till we thought that at each and at every knock </line>
<line> We should be obliged our ears for to stop. </line>
<line> And now, when at last he would let it alone, </line>
<line> Some Indian idols unto us were shown, – </line>
<line> To the lovers of oddities, let it not seem odd, </line>
<line> That I could have made as good out of a bean-pod! </line>
<line> Such kind of hole-eyes, such a parroty nose, </line>
<line> And straight stick-like legs, – and such nothing-like toes! – </line>
<line> That really I do not know what them to call, </line> 
<line> But queerly-formed figures or no form at all! </line> 
<line> Now where playful, the breezes each other they chased – </line>
<line> An Æolian harp in the window was placed,</line> 
<line> And the wind on its whispering, murmuring, wings – </line>
<line> Light-wand'ring amongst them, scarce touchèd the strings, </line> 
<line> And following the cadences. Nature alone </line>
<line> Could have given the wild, yet harmonious, tone – </line>
<line> Now calmly it sunk in a low, sighing breath, </line>
<line> Like the accents of mourning th' attendant of death, </line>
<line> When the hollow grave sounds, as returning the moan </line>
<line> And sobs, half suppressed, mingled in with the song. </line> 
<line> Then rose on our ears the high soundings of war, </line>
<line> When the brazen-lipped trumpet is heard from afar – </line>
<line> When the echoing drum-beats, its rage-rousing note, </line>
<pb n="58"/>
<line> And the battle-breath bursts from the pipe's shrilly throat, </line>
<line> So varied the sounds, which the swift breezes poured, </line>
<line> And now with numbers of harmony, vibrates the chord. </line>   
<line> Now coated with dust and hung up on the wall, </line>
<line> A wonderful mirror was shown unto all – </line>
<line> And those who would stand in a certain position </line>
<line> Seemed to come, with their own image, into collision. </line>
<line> I don't mean the glass, it was not at all there – </line>
<line> But a queer kind of image seemed painted on air – </line>
<line> So each with himself, after one kindly look </line>
<line> The hands as a token of kindness, he shook. </line>
<line> And then we beheld where the minerals lay </line>
<line> And the copper shone bright, with its golden-like ray. </line>
<line> And next, we were shown, upon quite a new plan-O, </line>
<line> A kind of a sort of a stoney piano! </line>
<line> Some stones in the bed of the <cdplace>Greta's</cdplace> stream, found, </line>
<line> Emitted, when struck, a most musical sound! </line>
<line> But, as some sounded high and as some sounded low, </line>
<line> They were ranged in the order of notes in a row, </line>
<line> And <cdperson>Mr. Crosthwaite</cdperson>, on their sides, 'gan to patter </line>
<line> A tune with a kind of a musical clatter, </line>
<line> From one end of his row to the other end ranging, </line>
<line> And rattling, and thumping, and chopping, and changing. </line>
<line> But this, though 'twas bearable, finished he soon </line>
<line> And ushered us into another small room </line>
<line> Which was almost filled up by a monstrous white bear, </line> 
<line> Whose most wonderful wonder was how it got there! – </line>
<line> With its master and everything else of a piece, </line>
<line> Full of dust, full of dirt, full of age, full of grease! </line>
<line> And on the shelves round, birds of every feather, – </line>
<line> Hawks, owls, parrots, eagles, and magpies, together. </line>
<line> And now, having looked all his rooms well about, </line>
<line> From <cdplace>Crosthwaite's Museum</cdplace>, we all trotted out, – </line>
<line> And as the sky looked quite as dark as before, </line> 
<pb n="59"/>
<line> That day we determined to ramble no more. </line>
<line> But 'twas settled, that next day, if fine was the weather, </line>   
<line> We'd go to the summit of <cdplace>Skiddaw</cdplace> together. </line>
<line> Next morning whose fineness so much we had hoped, </line>
<line> As soon as our eyelids completely were oped – </line>
<line> We looked to the window, but (oh, what a shame) – </line> 
<line> The eaves of the houses were dripping with rain. </line>
<line> And down in a pour it most peltingly pattered, </line>
<line> On roofs, tiles, and pavements, incessantly clattered. </line>
<line> And the clouds, o'er our heads – Cat and Doggedly storming – </line>
<line> They kept us within doors, the whole of the morning. </line>
<line> But when fair day declined o'er gigantic <cdplace>Grasmoor</cdplace> </line>
<line> The bright blushing sun shot his rays on the shore. </line>
<line> Then wandered we forth e'er the evening should close </line>
<line> And the shadowy mountains should sink to repose. </line>
<line> To gaze on his glory, we wandered forth, </line>
<line> And on the last margin of pebbles – we sport; </line>
<line> Now casting a stone in the deep drowsy lake, </line>
<line> To watch how the plunge would its still smoothness break – </line>
<line> While ripples on ripples succeedingly pour, </line>
<line> And chasing each other till driven on shore </line>
<line> Now hurried we home, and while taking our tea, </line>
<line> We thought – <cdperson>Mr Southey</cdperson> at church we might see </line>
<line> And then unto sleep we our bodies resigned, </line>
<line> And sunk in oblivion and silence our mind. </line>
<line> Next morning the church, how we wished for the reaching! </line>
<line> I'm afraid 'twas as much for the poet as preaching! </line>
<line> And, oh, what a shame! – were shown into a seat </line>
<line> With everything, save what was wanted, replete; </line>
<line> And so dirty, and greasy, though many times dusted, </line>
<line> The ladies all thought it could never be trusted; </line>
<line> First looking at seat, and again upon flounce, </line>
<pb n="60"/>
<line> And dusting, and gazing, for fear of their gowns! </line>
<line> I think all the time they took such mighty care </line>
<line> They sat upon thorns, and perhaps upon air! </line>
<line> Howe'er I forgave, – 'deed, I scarcely did know it, – </line>  
<line> For really we were  ̎cheek-by-jowl ̎ with the poet! </line>
<line> His hair was no colour at all by the way, </line>
<line> But half of 't was black as a coal, but in turning </line>
<line> They flashed, – ay, as much as that coal does in burning! </line>
<line> His nose in the midst took a small outward bend, </line>
<line> Rather hooked like an eagle's, and sharp at the end; </line>
<line> But his dark lightning-eye made him seem half-inspired, </line>
<line> Or like his own <cdtitle>Thalaba</cdtitle>, vengefully fired. </line>  
<line> We looked, and we gazed, and we stared in his face; </line> 
<line> Marched out at a slow, stopping, lingering, pace; </line>
<line> And as towards <cdplace>Keswick</cdplace> delighted we walked, </line>
<line> Of his face, and his form, and his features we talked </line>
<line> With various chatter beguiling the day </line>
<line> Till the sun disappeared and the light fled away. </line>
<line> The morning appeared with a great face of doubt, </line>
<line> Or to make us keep in, or to let us go out; </line>
<line> And at the first opening of joy-bringing dawn </line>
<line> Dark cloaks of thick clouds round the mountains were drawn. </line>
<line> We look at the window, – call guides after guides, – </line>
<line> Demand whether rain or fair weather betides. </line>
<line> The first puts his thumb on one side of his nose, </line>
<line> And looks up at the smoke, to see how the wind blows; </line>
<line> Then pronounces it, after a great deal of puffing, </line>
<line>  ̎A vara bad dai! Why you couldn't see nothing! ̎ </line> 
<line> The next, –  ̎Whai, ye sees, sir, I'se can't hardly say; </line> 
<line> Boot I'se think that it may be a middlin' fine day. ̎ </line>
<line> Another, --  ̎For <cdplace>Skudda</cdplace> this never will do, </line>
<line> But I think's it prove fine, though not fit for a view: </line>
<line> And so if you liked it, a trip you might take </line>
<pb n="61"/>
<line> By <cdplace>Borrowdale</cdplace> down unto <cdplace>Boothermere</cdplace> lake. ̎ </line> 
<line> Delighted, we heard the most capital thought, </line>
<line> And at the glad prospect we eagerly caught. </line>
<line> But the ladies a little were daunted in courage, </line>
<line> When they heard that six miles could be passed by no carriage, </line>
<line> And that 'twould require e'en a great deal of care </line>
<line> To ride upon sure-footed ponies up there. </line>  
<line> But the more that we heard of its steepness and trouble, </line>
<line> Our impatience to vanquish it still became double, </line>
<line> Till an open vehicle we ask, and a guide, </line>
<line> And following steeds, for the ladies, beside; </line>
<line> Which when ready all and prepared we were told, </line>
<line> Away from the Inn we must joyfully rolled </line>
<line> By the road to dark <cdplace>Borrowdale</cdplace> onward we ride, </line>
<line> By the wave-beaten beach of the <cdplace>Derwent's</cdplace> blue tide. </line>
<line> How fresh looked the waters! a breeze on them swept </line>
<line> And roused into anger their passionless depth, </line>
<line> Till the ripples which rose in its following train </line>
<line> Sunk into their own native silence again. </line>
<line> But now we were roused by a few rainy taps </line> 
<line> On the ribbon-bowed bonnets, and crowns of the hats: </line>
<line> Thus adding a fresh prospect unto the view, – </line>
<line> The beautiful prospect of being wet through! </line>
<line> So, covering our knees o'er with cloaks and shawls plenteous </line> 
<line> We erected a kind of parasol pent-house. </line>
<line> Then, after a great deal of rain preparation, </line>
<line> We awaited the shower, with a sad expectation. </line>
<line> It came with a kind of –  ̎I do not know <i>what </i> to do! </line>
<line> What I should, what I could, what I would, what I ought to do! ̎ </line>
<line> We were wondering much what 'twas going to be at, </line>
<line> And now it was this, and again it was that; </line>
<line> And the rain it was changeable ay as the wind, </line>
<pb n="62"/>
<line> Till to shine on our journey it made up its mind. </line>
<line> But the sun when at last to peep out he would deign, </line>
<line> Looked as if he'd been trouble as much by the rain, </line>
<line> Now in front rose the cliff where ˈmid tumble and roar, </line>
<line> The quaking crags quiver 'neath angry Lowdore. </line>
<line> But as long was the way, and as we were in haste, </line>
<line> Its waters, – those waters of thunder, we past. </line>
<line> And then we looked back upon <cdplace>Keswick's</cdplace> sweet vale, </line>
<line> Ere we entered the gorges of dark <cdplace>Borrowdale</cdplace>. </line>
<line> Beyond the bright space where the <cdplace>Derwent lake</cdplace> flows, </line>
<line> More majestic in distance huge <cdplace>Skiddaw</cdplace> arose; </line>
<line> And, softened, the valley was smilingly seen, </line>
<line> The lake's azure waters and islands between. </line>
<line> A range of huge mountains rose sheer from its verge, </line>
<line> And into the lake their steep pointlets they urge; </line>
<line> Where many a gulph, tree-surrounded, was made, </line>
<line> Where the wave placid rested, completely embayed: </line>
<line> While steep to the left the white Shepherd's crag stood, </line>
<line> And its loose slatey sides, thinly scattered with wood. </line>
<line> But now in our front our low road seemed to check </line>
<line> In a chaos of hills, a dark mountainous wreck. </line>
<line> All traces of verdure and forest were lost, </line>
<line> In that dark group of hills all so gloomily tost, </line>
<line> Where cliff after cliff and dark rock over rock </line>
<line> Reluctantly seemed at the heavens to stop. </line>
<line> Hanging o'er the dread dell their huge summits they hurled, </line>
<line> At whose foot the fair <cdplace>Derwent</cdplace> so crystalline purled. </line>
<line> Astonished, we passed through that wilderness lone, </line>
<line> Till burst on our eyesight dark <cdplace>Bowder's</cdplace> huge stone. </line>
<line> A dark rock its high summit right forward did force, </line>
<line> And altered the fierce torrent's rock-beating course. </line>
<line> High raised on its brink, frowning down on the flood, </line>
<pb n="63"/>
<line> A vast mass of mossy rock dreadfully stood: </line>
<line> It seemed from the heights high above as if torn, </line>
<line> And down to its wonderful resting-place borne. </line>
<line> But nature most queerly contrived has to hitch it, </line>
<line> And poised on a narrow edge, managed to pitch it; </line>
<line> And yet though so balanced, so firm is the rock, </line>
<line> You may mount by a ladder quite up to the top, </line>
<line> As when some vast ship the blue ocean divides, </line>
<line> Her keen arching bow stems the breast of the tides; </line>
<line> The wondering waves 'gainst her stern dash their spray; </line>
<line> The waters enraged yet are forced to obey; </line>
<line> And back from her sides the huge billows are thrown – </line>
<line> So sternly triumphing appeared Bowder Stone. </line>
<line> By many a rugged and stern, slatey fell, </line> 
<line> Right onward we passed through the gorge of the dell, </line>
<line> Till slightly it widened and freshened the scene </line>
<line> Where some grassy meadows were washed by the stream; </line>
<line> And behind, the dark rocks in the distance were furled, </line>
<line> While the crystalline river between them it purled. </line>
<line> Now across the old bridge, o'er the river, we trot </line>
<line> Till our road at the foot of the mountain did stop. </line>
<line> And then, as the path was excessively stony, </line>
<line> Our guide for each lady brought forward a pony, </line>
<line> And agreed, as the end of our pathway was utter here, </line>
<line> Our carriage, returning, should meet us at <cdplace>Buttermere</cdplace>. </line>
<line> Now for mounting the ladies we took many pains </line>
<line> With holding the stirrup and checking the reins, </line>
<line> Or scrambling upon some convenient stone, </line>
<line> Or mounting a wall to get easier on. </line>
<line> Guide holding the bridle, the better to guide 'em, </line>
<line> The gentlemen walking and ladies a-riding – </line>
<line> But, oh, what a road! – 'twas a terrible shame, – </line> 
<line>  ̎A road,  ̎ did I say? 'Twas not worthy the name. </line>
<line> A road only fit to be clambered by sheep, </line>
<line> As toilsome, as rough, and as long as 'twas steep , – </line>
<pb n="64"/>
<line> Ascending the <cdplace>Derwent's</cdplace> first sources beside, </line> 
<line> Now only a rock-tumbling, pebbly tide. </line>
<line> Here and there at its banks fed a few scattered sheep, </line>
<line> Which cropped the thin heather, scarce covering the steep </line>
<line> Some sleeping, some climbing, some frisking, some browsing, </line>
<line> At the sound of our footsteps a moment arousing. </line>
<line> Unaccustomed to man 'mid that desert so drear, </line>
<line> They gazed in wonder, but seemed not to fear, – </line>
<line> And knowing him not, therefore dreading no ill, </line>
<line> Lay down, having looked on the heath-covered hill. </line>
<line> We slowly, and pantingly scrambled along, – </line>
<line> The ponies full carefully stepped o'er each stone. </line>
<line> Full frequent the streams from their cloud-hidden source </line>
<line> Dashed down the dark mountain their thundering course, </line>
<line> Or over the road they did rippling flow, </line>
<line> And fed, with their waters, the torrent below. </line>
<line> The horses dashed through with a gown-splashing step, </line>
<line> But the ladies had gowns just intended for wet! </line>
<line> I really do think they scarce cared a pin </line>
<line> Whether we stayed behind, or jumped over – or in! </line>
<line> And now, we behold the stern mountain's huge head, </line>
<line> From whose riven rocks they mine out the black-lead </line>
<line> Which is hidden within the dark crags so prolific. </line>
<line>  ̎Black lead, ̎ did I say? Oh how unscientific – </line>
<line> Dear me, what a vulgar mistake I have made-o, – </line>
<line> In the language of science, 'tis called plumbago. </line>
<line> But ne'er, Oh dread <cdplace>Borrowdale</cdplace>, would'st thou have given, </line>
<line> Or suffered thy rocks for that lead, to be riven, </line>
<line> If thou thought'st by some Miss scrawled thy desert so drear </line>
<line> In an Ackermann Album would ever appear. </line>
<line> And now on the peak of the mountains we stood, – </line>
<line> Looked back upon field, upon forest, and flood, </line>
<line> Where sun-topped <cdplace>Helvellyn</cdplace> his summits upthrew, </line>
<pb n="65"/>
<line> Distinctly outlined on the firmament blue; </line>
<line> And the few retired fields which in <cdplace>Borrowdale</cdplace> lay </line>
<line> So richly reposed in th' enlivening ray. </line>
<line> But no longer we now on the mountain remain, </line>
<line> But hasten broad <cdplace>Buttermere's</cdplace> banks to attain: </line>
<line> Our way down the gorge of the valley we bend, </line>
<line> And slowly the rough mountain-path we descend. </line>
<line> Vast <cdplace>Honister Crag</cdplace>, overhanging the road, </line>
<line> Pushed right 'cross our path his high forehead so broad, </line>
<line> Opposing our progress. We turned round his brow, – </line>
<line> Encircled his cliff by the streamlet below; </line>
<line> And gazed on the giant, as round him we wheeled, </line>
<line> As his wonderful shape was distinctly revealed. </line>
<line> He's none of your beauties, – no elegant wood </line>
<line> With romantical glades on his summits upstood; </line> 
<line> No softening the scene, or enlivening the view, </line>
<line> No fading in distance the mountains so blue: </line>
<line> No cockneys could find in its dread rocks so antique </line>
<line> The fair picturesque or the rural romantic </line>
<line> No silly school-bred miss just turned seventeen </line>
<line> Can affectedly say of't –  ̎How charming a scene!!! ̎</line>
<line> But above any misses, Oh my admiration! – </line>
<line> Dark <cdplace>Honister Crag</cdplace> rears his stern elevation, – </line>
<line> Makes one silent in wonder and dread altogether, </line>
<line> As feeling description a fruitless endeavour. </line>
<line> But now we were forced, by a bend in the hills, </line>
<line> To cross o'er the torrent, receiver of rills, </line>
<line> Which dashed down the pass, chafed, and foaming in wrath </line>
<line> At the huge rocks, which lay in its furious path. </line>
<line> Right dashed in the ladies and they, being through, </line>
<line> Left us all behind, puzzled much what to do. </line>
<line> We looked to the left, and we looked to the right, – </line>
<line> Still no easy passage appeared to our sight; </line>
<pb n="66"/>
<line> Stones were in the stream but were rough and were round </line>
<line> And the foam of the waves, oh it sported around; </line>
<line> And altogether, ere our leaping, we took plenty looking, </line>
<line> Yet still it was dangerous, slippery, footing, – </line>
<line> And as none could be reached from the shore with a step, </line>
<line> If we leaped on their surface, so polished and wet, </line>
<line> Or if in our bound, we might happen to stumble, – </line>
<line> 'Twas clear, we ran very great risk of a tumble! </line>
<line> But each like a hen on a hot gridle hopping, </line> 
<line> And stagg'ring and balancing – still never stopping – </line>
<line> And slipping and sliding, and sliddring at last, sir, </line>
<line> We accomplished the dandy, all dangerous pass, sir. </line>
<line> But, oh dear, the ladies (were only a pair of 'em) </line>
<line> What ill rewards gave for our mighty great care of 'em </line>
<line> By what kind of artifice, oh can they that elude, </line>
<line> Or how can they stand to the charge of ingratitude! </line>
<line> By the time that with plenty of duck-threatening hops, sir, </line>
<line> We had scrambled ashore from those slippery rocks, sir, </line>
<line> The ladies had got to a part of the glen </line>
<line> Some quarter mile distant, where, bending again, </line>
<line> The rocks with their shaggy tops, gloomy and bare, </line>
<line> Looked back to the region of torrent and scar. </line>
<line> There, – but not for us, waited. 'Twas only the fear </line>
<line> Of losing themselves in that desert so drear </line>
<line> That made them, at last, check the long-loosened rein </line>
<line> And impatiently, wait for our coming again! </line>
<line> But enough. We advanced by a pleasanter road. </line>
<line> The stream on our right, it more pleasantly flowed </line>
<line> And watered the vale; the dark mountains, receding, </line>
<line> Left open our path, it no longer impeding, – </line> 
<line> And widening the vale, their tops backward they threw, </line>
<line> And to <cdplace>Buttermere</cdplace> opened, so deep and so blue. </line>
<line> We saw not the lake, till the stream being crossed, </line>
<pb n="67"/>
<line> We stood on its banks, where its waters were tost </line>
<line> And hurled on the pebbles with dashing and foam, </line>
<line> The whispering surges their singing do moan, </line>
<line> When broke on the stones yet return to the deep – </line>
<line> Again, to the sands of their wrecking they sweep, – </line>
<line> Again, they are broken, re-rolling again, – </line>
<line> Yet still are they murmuring, still are the same. </line>
<line> On a road that was shaded by natural wood </line>
<line> Whose rich, mossy, trunk most confusedly stood, </line>
<line> We slowly advanced by field and by flood, – </line>
<line> But had not gone far till were stopped by the mud. </line>
<line> Through a deep, miry, slough we were forced to go, </line>
<line> It much having rained and the road lying low. </line>
<line> There were some high banks on one side of the road, </line>
<line> But were covered and fenced up, by bramble and wood. </line>
<line> We caught hold of a barge and we scrambled there up, – </line>
<line> But there, 'mid the brambles, we almost had stuck. </line>
<line> The bramble, Oh dear, 'tis a tree of renown </line>
<line> For catching a coat-tail, or tearing a gown; </line>
<line> Besides, it talks Latin: though no one would guess it, </line>
<line> Its thorns say,  ̎Me nemo impune lacessit ̎, – </line>
<line> While elastical boughs, by the first of us bent back, </line>
<line> Switched back in our face, as we followed his track </line>
<line> From the hand which back bent it. As't angrily flies out, </line>
<line> We almost cried,  ̎Zooks, sir! You near put my eye out! ̎ </line>
<line> But now, having past by the pass of the bramble, </line>
<line> We almost began to be tired of our ramble – </line>
<line> Till we gladly beheld the clean whitewashen inn, – </line>          
<line> A few yards of earth inteposing between. </line>
<line> Straight (not like sad Hector, that poor gory chief) </line>
<line> Appeared the glad ghost of roast mutton and beef. </line>
<line> Very horses go faster, and swifter they fly; </line>
<line> Their ears at the sight they did left upon high, – </line>
<line> Flew back 'neath their heels the long, lingering way, – </line>
<line> Them backoned the spirit of manger and hay! </line>
<pb n="68"/>
<line> Now reached we the inn and no sooner were landed, </line>
<line> Than straight, we to bring us our dinner commanded. </line>
<line> When lo, the landlady, most courteously brings – </line>
<line> I suppose 'twas to hasten old Time's lazy wings – </line>
<line> A great set of scrawls. I suppose that she thought 'em </line>
<line> Most wondrously fine, or she would not have brought 'em </line>
<line> Which her daughter, her daughter, her dear, darling daughter, </line>
<line> Had made of romantical mountains and water, </line>
<line> At some genteel boarding school, wasting her time – </line>
<line> And also her paper, with line after line; </line>
<line> The houses, all tipsy, most giddily reeling – </line>
<line> The castles in air most confusedly wheeling – </line>
<line> And lions, like cats, in their dark caverns brooding – </line>
<line> And each flying cloud, like a flying plum-pudding – </line>
<line> And noble stitched quadrupeds, birds, insects fishes, </line>
<line> And all the <i> et ceteras </i> of boarding-school misses! </line>
<line> Now dinner, brought in, was adorning the board; </line>
<line> The dishes, we hoped, were most plenteously stored, – </line>
<line> So we hungrily took from the viands the covers, </line>
<line> But there was no treat for the good-dinner lovers. </line> 
<line> Though our appetites were most tremendously high </line>
<line> We only got taties and mouldy veal pie! </line>
<line> But now on the mountains the dark clouds assembled, </line>
<line> And the waves of the lake they more gloomily trembled; </line>
<line> And then came a calm on their billowless breast, </line>
<line> As deep expectations were stilling their rest. </line>
<line> The clouds flew not swift, but in low'ring and gloom </line>
<line> Lay mighty and dark on the heat of the noon, </line>
<line> The air was oppressive, and sultry, and still, </line>
<line> And no cooling breezes swept over the hill. </line>
<line> When lo! from a cloud o'er dark <cdplace>Honister's</cdplace> head </line>  
<line> There gleamed through the darkness a thunderbolt red. </line>
<line> The lake for a moment reflected the flash, </line>
<line> Then dreadfully heard in the distance a crash, </line>
<pb n="69"/>
<line> As if mountains on mountains that moment were hurled, </line>
<line> Or dashed into atoms and ruins a world, </line>
<line> Or rocks to their heart by the lightning were riven, – </line>
<line> So the thunder it rolled o'er the face of the heaven. </line>
<line> Re-echoed from mountains, rebounding from hills, </line>
<line> Again the dread sound the vast aether it fills: </line>
<line> O'er gloomy <cdplace>Helvellyn</cdplace> sublimly it swells, </line>  
<line> Then wakes the rude echoes of <cdplace>Langdale's</cdplace> peaked fells; </line>
<line> Then <cdplace>Kirkstone's</cdplace> vast echoes replied to the sound, </line>
<line> And hurled it the circle of mountains around; </line>
<line> Red Pike tossed the thunder in distance with scorn, </line>
<line> Till the dells of the <cdplace>Derwent</cdplace> receiving the storm, </line>
<line> The thunder it spoke from the crags of Lowdore, </line>  
<line> And <cdplace>Skiddaw's</cdplace> twin summits awoke to the roar. </line>
<line> Again growled the lion on <cdplace>Saddleback's</cdplace> dells </line>
<line> And the last thunder died on the distant <cdplace>Shap fells</cdplace>. </line>
<line> Then, fitful, the breeze from its mountainous hold </line>
<line> Forced all th stern thunders to peace as it rolled. </line>
<line> The winds in their anger rushed down on the deep, </line>
<line> Through every ravine, with a passionate sweep; </line>
<line> Then woke the dark waters, and plumage of foam </line>
<line> On the lakes swelling bosom was dazzlingly thrown, </line>
<line> Reflecting the lightning; and rattling peals </line>
<line> Again roused the mimicking sport of the hills. </line>
<line> Those chasm-hidden lions again from their caves </line>
<line> Sent back the dread sounds o'er the wondering waves; </line>
<line> And the echoes from <cdplace>Black-combe</cdplace>, o'erhanging the main, </line>
<line> To <cdplace>Scawfell</cdplace> in mockery growled them again. </line>
<line> And numberless flashes and numberless roars </line>
<line> Hurled all their lone terrors on deep <cdplace>Crummock's</cdplace> shores; </line>
<line> Till the clouds o'er the lake which so threateningly hung, </line> 
<line> Flew away, the huge fells of the <cdplace>Derwent</cdplace> among. </line>
<line> Then first, the bright orb of the heavens appearing, </line>
<line> Again with his presence the hills he was cheering; </line>
<line> Though a shower, yet distilling its dews on the ground, </line>
<pb n="70"/>
<line> Its glistening drops were outpouring around. </line>
<line> Till, high o'er the heads of the mountains below, </line>
<line> There spanned the wide heavens the wonderful bow; </line>
<line> All glowing in purple, and crimson, and gold, </line>
<line> It grasped in its circle the waters, which rolled, – </line>
<line> Returning the colours so gloriously given, – </line>
<line> Returning again to the face of the Heaven, – </line>
<line> Till its bright dazzling tints in the distance do fade, </line>
<line> Admiring its hues, at the window, we staid. </line>
<line> And then, as the sun on the mountains descending, </line>
<line> Reminded us now that the day was near ending, </line>
<line> We ordered the bill, and, as then we did find </line>
<line> That a long and steep hill was by us to be climbed, </line>
<line> And as also we found that the one of the ladies </line>
<line> To ascend the high hill in the coach much afraid is, </line>
<line> One gentleman leaving on them to attend, </line>
<line> That steep on the ponies we 'gan to ascend, </line>
<line> While they with the carriage the mountains upclimbed, </line> 
<line> Which lazy and last of all lingered behind. </line>
<line> And now a cascade in the hills were beheld, </line>
<line> Whose crystalline waters with anger they swelled – </line>
<line> But scarce had we looked on the thundering stream </line>
<line> 'Ere again the stern heavens to rain on's begin. </line>
<line>  ̎O Jupiter! why did'st permit such a shame, </line>    
<line> On the ladies fine bonnets allow it to rain? ̎ </line>
<line>  ̎Why, generous Jove, whom I can't see for clouds, </line>
<line> Why spread on these mountains such vapoury shrouds? ̎ </line>
<line>  ̎Oh pray, sir, remove this most troublesome rain </line>
<line> And give us the sun in his glory again. ̎ </line>
<line>  ̎Oh no, sir, I won't, and I tell you I can't </line>
<line> And what's more than all these, sir, I tell you I shan't; </line>
<line> And although I do think that you don't it much love, </line>
<line> I'll pepper you more, ̎ for 'twas thus replied Jove. </line>
<line> But while we continued this vain supplication, </line>
<line> We found 'twas unfitting, upon the occasion, </line>
<pb n="71"/>
<line> To stand in the mud and receive all the rain </line>
<line> While talking, beseeching, and praying, – in vain.</line> 
<line> So, pushing our steeds to a galloping trot, </line>
<line> The scenes we were passing completely forgot, </line>
<line> And one of us hitched on a huge ladies saddle, </line>
<line> (Of course, rather awkward for riding a straddle). </line>
<line> The ladies and carriage completely behind, </line>
<line> Towards <cdplace>Keswick</cdplace> we galloped, as swift as the wind, </line>
<line> Who, half in revenge for his losing the race, </line>
<line> He gave us, he gave us, a terrible chase, – </line>
<line> Like Paddy who drove all the racers before him, </line>
<line> So gallantly, on Mr. Boreas bore him, –</line>
<line> Until we arrived at a kind of a shed </line>
<line> Under whose sheltering roof we, our ponies, did lead. </line>
<line> There long did we wait till the ladies up came, </line>
<line> When, one of us entered the carriage again, </line>
<line> While I very gladly accepted the offer </line>
<line> Which gentlemen, two, very kindly did proffer, </line>
<line> And sheltered myself from the pityless flood </line> 
<line> By entering their carriage, so covered and snug. </line>
<line> And followed the ladies, while show'r after show'r </line>
<line> In pityless peltings upon us did pour, </line>
<line> Ne'er ceasing, ne'er ceasing, the merciless rain </line>
<line> Until to our covering <cdplace>Keswick</cdplace> we came, </line>
<line> Where the halls did resound with the loud lamentations, </line>
<line> And the walls did re-echo the deep exclamations, – </line>
<line> The ladies bemoaning their bonnets in vain, </line>
<line> Those bonnets they never may worn be again, </line>
<line> And then what delight when to tea we sat down – </line> 
<line> The mourning all ended for bonnet and gown, – </line>
<line> And heard the rain pattering and rattling, as we </line>
<line> Most thirstily drank up the goblets of tea; </line>
<line> And then on our couches, as softly we lay, </line>
<line> We determined old <cdplace>Skiddaw</cdplace>, to climb the next day. </line>

<poem>
<line> The hills were obscured in a curtain of cloud; </line>
<line> Every stern, savage fell had its vapoury shroud. </line>
<line> The dark veil of the east it was not yet withdrawn, </line>
<line> And cheerless and drear the approach of the morn. </line>
<line> As we looked on the clouds with great feelings of sorrow, </line>
<line> How sadly we thought,  ̎We must wait till tomorrow! ̎ </line>
<line> Sometimes we did mope, as the clouds past us by; </line>
<line> And again we did hope, as appeared the blue sky. </line>
<line> At length into the distance the vapours were borne, </line>
<line> And the dreary gloom yields to the rays of the morn: </line>
<line> On the breast of the breeze were the clouds borne away, </line>
<line> And the mountains again were revealed to the day. </line>
<line> The rich outlines of <cdplace>Grassmoor</cdplace> distinctly were seen; </line>
<line> And <cdplace>Helvellyn</cdplace>, he lowr'd in his silence serene. </line>
<line> While the lake's gentle billows, like pure molten gold, </line>
<line> In soft and low murmurs succeedingly roll'd. </line>
<line> We gazed on the sky, now so azure and bright, – </line>
<line> We gazed on that sky with unmingled delight. </line>
<line> How high beat our hearts with the great expectation! </line>
<pb n="80"/>
<line> And straight we began to make great preparation. </line>
<line> Cakes, sandwiches, ham, were by no means unhandy; </line>
<line> And amongst other things we forgot not some brandy. </line>
<line> We bustle and hustle and fidget about, </line>
<line> And call all the servants, and kick up a rout. </line>
<line> We stretch and we yawn, so impatient to go, </line>
<line> And think that the time flies amazingly slow! </line>
<line> We pull out our watch; put it up to our ear; </line>
<line>  ̎Ah well, I declare, it is going, I hear! ̎ </line>
<line> Then in comes the hostess, so prim and so neat, – </line>
<line>  ̎A very fine morning, sir! ̎— ̎'Tis, ma'am, indeed. ̎</line> 
<line>  ̎I have brought, sir, some skirts for the ladies to ride in; ̎</line>
<line>  ̎Oh, ma'am, I declare, you're extremely obligin'! ̎ </line>
<line>  ̎Oh, sir, pray don't speak of it! ̎ While saying so, </line>
<line> She maketh her exit, in curtseying low. </line>
<line> And now a loud clatter is heard in the yard; </line>
<line> Where the steeds for the journey at length were prepared. </line>
<line> Such beautiful creatures, I here must describe 'em, </line>
<line> And the pleasure with which we expected to ride 'em! </line>
<line> There was one that was white, and another was grey, – </line>
<line> Such fine, flowing tails, and such long ears, had they; – </line>
<line> They champed at the bit and they snuffed up the wind </line>
<line> As if they intended to leave it behind. </line>
<line> At length, we set off, quite delighted and gay, </line>
<line> But determined to walk a small part of the way, – </line>
<line> Excepting myself, who determined to ride, </line>
<line> And so we set off, by the clear river-side. </line>
<line> Then we came to the bridge of grey, moss-covered stone </line>
<line> Which across the swift <cdplace>Greta's</cdplace> bright ripples is thrown; </line>
<line> On the top of that bridge, for a moment, we stay </line>
<line> To gaze on the torrent as't foams on its way. </line>
<line> We gazed on the whirlpools, as boiling, they broke </line>
<line> In sheets of white foam on the surf-beaten rock; </line>
<line> We gazed on their eddies, as circling they sweep </line>
<line> Amid the rough crags, silent, darkling and deep. </line>  
<pb n="81"/>
<line> We gazed on the currents, as foaming they rush, </line>
<line> And list to their murmurs, as onwards they gush. </line>
<line> How wild were these murmurs, as soothing and slow, </line>
<line> In nature's own numbers, so softly they flow. </line>
<line> At length we determined, the bridge being past, </line>
<line> On mounting our beautiful ponies at last. </line>
<line> Oh! what an affair of importance then made is, </line>
<line> Oh! what an affair of importance then made is, </line>
<line> With settling, and helping, and mounting, the ladies. </line>
<line>  ̎I am sure I shall fall! ̎ —  ̎I am sure I am tumbling! ̎ </line>
<line>  ̎Oh no ma'am you're safe, ̎  ̎But my steed is a-stumbling! ̎ </line>
<line>  ̎Oh ma'am he's the surefooted'st beast upon earth. ̎</line>
<line>  ̎My saddle is loose. ̎  ̎Shall I tighten the girth? ̎</line>
<line>  ̎Oh, but look at him! – now is stopping and feeding! ̎ </line>
<line>  ̎Pull him up, ma'am. ̎ –  ̎I can't ̎ –  ̎Then I see I must lead him. ̎ </line>
<line> Such pranks and such frolics our chargers displayed, </line>
<line> And such a great hustle and rumpus is made: </line> 
<line> At length being seated quite steady and firm, </line>
<line> The heads of our horses towards <cdplace>Skiddaw</cdplace> we turn. </line>
<line> While laughing and talking swift onwards we trot, </line>
<line> And all ills and all accidents soon are forgot. </line>
<line> But some troubles still the ascending attended, </line>
<line> For the road, I must say, wanted much to be mended: </line>
<line> The quagmires were long, and the quagmires were broad, </line>
<line> And many and deep were the ruts of the road. </line>
<line> And unless we kept on at a pretty brisk trot, </line>
<line> Where'er there was grass, there our steeds made a stop; </line>
<line> And then if at all in a hurry we posted, </line>
<line> With the heat of the sun we were like to be roasted. </line>
<line> And while in the regions of heat we remained, </line>
<line> Of the heat and the flies we all loudly complained. </line>
<line> At last we arrived at the banks of a stream </line> 
<line> Which dashed down a small, and a narrow ravine. </line>
<line> Now all of our steeds were prodigiously dry, </line>
<pb n="82"/>
<line> From the heat of the sun, and the clear, cloudless sky; </line>
<line> How wistful and thirsty did all of them look, </line>
<line> As, splashing, we dashed through the waves of the brook. </line>
<line> But one of them, knowing the Miss on its back, </line>
<line> Was not able to keep him in his proper track, – </line>
<line> Regardless of briars, of stones, or of trees </line>
<line> Sought a place where he might have drunk more at his ease! </line>
<line> At length we contrived to turn him about </line>
<line> And leaving the stream, we continued our route. </line>
<line> Now a terrible quagmire lay right in our road </line>
<line> It was deep, it was long and moreover, 'twas broad. </line>
<line> But we cared not for mud and we cared not for mire, </line> 
<line> For our bosoms beat high with a lofty desire: </line>
<line> When the summit of Skiddaw was once in our view, </line>
<line> Through all opposition resistless we flew! </line>
<line> So headlong we dashed to the heart of the bog – </line> 
<line> Our horses we spur and horses we flog, – </line>
<line> And splashing and dashing we floundered about, – </line>
<line> We got easily in, and not easily out! </line>
<line> We thought, in the quag, that we fairly were stuck, </line>
<line> So tenacious, so deep, and so yielding the muck! </line>
<line> Some of us sunk less, and some of us sunk more, </line>
<line> As struggling, we spurred on our steeds to the shore, </line>
<line> Such figures presenting, bespattered with dirt, </line>
<line> Which our horse-tails upon us, in flapping, did flirt, – </line>
<line> The ladies bemoaning their gowns' spoilation, </line>
<line> The gentlemen mourning their coats' spatteration! </line>
<line> Such moans, hones, and groans were resounding around! </line>
<line> There never was heard such a coat-weeping sound! </line>
<line> So mournful our cries, so heart-piercing our wails, </line>
<line> Over what? Over what? Why, upon our coat-trails! </line>
<line> They who on such a subject refuse to bemoan, </line>
<line> Have hearts that are hard as the nether millstone. </line>
<line> And now, we resumed our marching once more, </line>
<pb n="83"/>
<line> But neither so gay or so clean as before. </line> 
<line> Of bogs and of brooks we began to be tired, </line>
<line> For nobody likes to be soundly bemired. </line>
<line> We began to complain of the cold and the wind </line>
<line> And some of our horses were lagging behind; </line>
<line> Till, having arrived at the breast of the hill, </line>
<line> To rest and to breathe, we a moment stood still. </line>
<line> Then we spurred up the breast of the mountain each steed, </line>
<line> And we prest on each courser, so gallant to speed; </line>
<line> We struggled o'er heather, we struggled o'er stone, </line>
<line> Till each horse's fetlocks were white with its foam. </line>
<line> We leaned o'er the manes of our chargers which flow, </line>
<line> Till they sweep o'er the bells of the heather below. </line>
<line> How rich was that heather, luxuriantly spread, </line>
<line> Wherever the hoofs of our horses might tread; </line>
<line> And how bright were its flowers of Tyrian dye, </line>
<line> On the mountain's green bosom, neglected which lie. </line>
<line> And now the steep hill being mounted, we came, </line>
<line> And much to our joy, to a fine, turfy plain. </line>
<line> The grass was so rich and its hue was so bright, </line>
<line> Like circles where fairies have danced through the night. </line>
<line> How swiftly and lightly our palfreys swept o'er, </line>
<line> And how swiftly and lightly our palfreys swept o'er </line>
<line> Till we came to a spring which with gurgling sound, </line>
<line> And bubbling, and dancing, sprung up from the ground. </line>
<line> There stay we our steeds, that we all might survey </line>
<line> The beautiful prospect before us which lay; </line>
<line> The vapourless heaven shone bright over head, </line>
<line> The valley beneath us was widely outspread; </line>
<line> And the forests, arrayed in the clothing of green, </line>
<line> On the sides of the mountains arising were seen; </line>
<line> While through the wide valley meandering slow, </line>
<line> The stream of the Derwent doth silently flow. </line>
<line> How fair were the fields which the light lapping wave, </line>
<pb n="84"/>
<line> Each following and followed succeeding doth lave; </line>
<line> Till recklessly dancing and carelessly tost, </line>
<line> In the deeps of the <cdplace>Derwent</cdplace> the billow is lost. </line>
<line> We gazed on the lake, – oh, how calmly it lay, </line>
<line> Scarce touched by the zephyrs o'er 'ts bosom which play! </line>
<line> How bright its smooth surface deceitfully smiles, </line>
<line> Embosomed in mountains, and studded with isles, </line>
<line> Whose trees, richly clothed in a bright living green, </line>
<line> Again seemed to grow 'neath the surface serene. </line>
<line> We gazed on the fells sternly rising, which frowned; </line>
<line> We gazed on the mountains dispersed around, </line>
<line> Whose high, craggy summits confusedly tost, </line>
<line> In the vapours which floated around them were lost. </line>
<line> But whose is that dwelling surrounding with trees </line>
<line> Whose rising smoke curls as it floats on the breeze? </line>
<line> It is his who so deeply hath graven his name, – </line>
<line> It ne'er shall be razed from the annals of fame. </line>
<line> It is his who hath swept o'er <cdplace>Arabia's</cdplace> sand; </line>
<line> It is his who hath travelled the far foreign land; </line>
<line> It is his who hath wakened the chords of the lyre </line>
<line> In the strength of its muse with celestial fire. </line>
<line> Who can ride the wild winds, and who proudly can sweep </line>
<line> O'er the fierce foaming billow, – the broad bursting deep? </line>
<line> Apollo shall list when he touches the string </line>
<line> And the muses play homage where Southey shall sing! </line>
<line> Then we gazed down the lake, where swift rush to the shore </line>
<line> The far-sounding waters of distant <cdplace>Lowdore</cdplace>; </line>
<line> As, hurled down the chasm, how thund'ring it broke, </line>
<line> Rebounding from crag, and rebounding from rock! </line>
<line> And how brightly and lightly the sunny rays, play, </line>
<line> While sparkling amid clouds of far flashing spray! </line>
<line> Then we looked to the south, where the dark <cdplace>Borrowdale</cdplace> </line>
<line> Frowned drear o'er the <cdplace>Derwent</cdplace>, stern, savage and fell; </line>
<line> While under those cliffs e'en the surges that sweep </line>
<pb n="85"/>
<line> Seemed mournfully silent, dark, dismal and deep. </line>
<line> While hidden in mist, and obscured by storm, </line>
<line> Gaunt, <cdplace>Castle-Crag</cdplace> rose; oh, how dreadful its form! </line>
<line> As it guarded those Jaws which seemed deep as the grave, </line>
<line> As they frowned o'er the foam of broad <cdplace>Derwent's</cdplace> light wave. </line>
<line> Then turning our eyes from the breast of the lake, </line>
<line> We looked to the hills which o'erhang <cdplace>Ladies Rake</cdplace>. </line>  
<line> There is a tradition of this peaceful dell </line>
<line> Which the crones of the <cdplace>Derwent</cdplace> will often times tell. </line>
<line> It was night and the stars seemed in silence to rest, </line>
<line> In ethereal splendour on th' waves gentle breast </line>
<line> And in heavenly splendour how softly they sleep </line>
<line> On that ocean of lustre, that radiant deep. </line>
<line> While before the bright moon as the light surges dance, </line>
<line> In thousands of gems they reflected her glance, – </line>
<line> And as each swelling billow rolled on to the shore, </line>
<line> Still greater refulgence their heaving breasts pour; </line>
<line> And rolling the pebbles, and heaving the sand, </line>
<line> In foaming, bright diamonds break on the strand. </line>
<line> Spray-sprinkling the shore as they whispering sigh, </line>
<line> Then sink in the waters for ever, – to die. </line> 
<line> Man rested in slumber, so soft, and so deep, </line>
<line> And the scene it was plunged in the silence of sleep; </line>
<line> The herds of the deer, ' mid the woodlands, did rest, </line>
<line> And the sky-loving eagle reposed in its nest. </line>
<line> But who madly flies up the dread mountain vale, </line>
<line> Her locks all dishevelled, her countenance pale, </line>
<line> And the fitful night winds whistle loud through her hair </line>
<line> Which madly and trembling her clenched fingers tear? </line>
<line> 'Tis the Countess of <cdplace>Derwent</cdplace>, uncheered and unknown; </line>
<line> She strays in the desert, all drear and lone. </line>
<line> Aurora withdraws the dark shades of the night </line>
<line> And peeps o'er the hills with her blue eyes so bright. </line>
<line> Her fair fingers the terrified vapours unfold </line>
<pb n="86"/>
<line> And twined round her brow is a circlet of gold, </line>
<line> But that glen's savage rocks a pale corse lies beneath, – </line>
<line> The visage distorted, and ghastly, in death. </line>
<line> Oh winds, sigh ye softly, and o'er her bemoan, </line>
<line> Unburied who dies in the wilderness Ione. </line>
<line> And e'er since that time, at the still hour of night, </line>
<line> Her sad spirit wings round <cdplace>Lord's Island</cdplace> its flight </line>
<line> Disturbèdly flitting around its lone haunt </line> 
<line> And notes, all unknown, it doth mournfully chaunt. </line>  
<line> And its name from that flight the dark valley did take, </line>
<line> And ever since then has been called <cdplace>Ladies Rake</cdplace>. </line>
<line> Thus the beautiful prospect we all did survey, – </line>
<line> Then began to prepare for the rest of the way. </line>
<line> Some sandwiches take and some brandy we sip, </line>
<line> Applying it just to the tip of the lip, – </line>
<line> And our spirits revived and restorèd our strength, </line>
<line> We set off on the rest of our journey at length. </line>
<line> How jollily onwards we all of us went! </line>
<line> But our eyes to the ground we were forced to keep bent, </line>
<line> For fear that our steeds in their progress should stumble, </line>
<line> And that might produce a most unlucky tumble. </line>
<line> Avoiding each hillock, each stone and each stick, </line>
<line> The steps of our ponies we carefully pick. </line>
<line> And still we ascended, still higher and higher, </line>
<line> And still to the summit came nigher and nigher. </line>  
<line> And still we kept laughing and talking, and still </line>
<line> We trotted along on the side of the hill, </line>
<line> Till we reached an ascent where low hillocks of green, </line>
<line> Like mountainous molehills, were everywhere seen. </line>
<line> We dashed on our steeds and we spurred up the rise; – </line>
<line> Oh sight most delightful that greeted our eyes! </line>
<line> A ridge we beheld ('twas of loose, slatey stone); </line>
<line> It led to the summit we'd wished for so long. </line>
<line> But now our teeth chattered and our noses looked blue, </line>
<pb n="87"/>
<line> And our ears were assuming a Tyrian hue. </line>
<line> For the wind, I should say that he blew from the east, </line>
<line> And that is an icyish quarter at best, </line>
<line> I mean it is cold whenever it blows, </line> 
<line> But now it had taken such hold of our nose. </line>
<line> Then to guard 'gainst the cold we did button our coats, </line>
<line> Protecting our bodies with mantles and cloaks; </line>
<line> Then tight round our necks we did tie our cravats, </line>
<line> More firm to our heads we did fasten our hats: </line>
<line> Then steady and ready, we made up our mind </line>
<line> To fight and to conquer the cold and the wind. </line>
<line> So struggling we forced o'er the ridge of loose stone </line>
<line> Every second we thought we should over be blown; </line>
<line> And although of its force we did loudly complain, </line>
<line> The summit of <cdplace>Skiddaw</cdplace> at last we attain. </line>
<line> Then our swift, eager eyes we impatiently threw </line>
<line> On th' extensive, the wondrous, the beautiful view. </line>
<line> Having rested awhile, we straight turned our eyes </line>
<line> Where the towers and domes of <cdplace>Carlisle</cdplace>/cdplace> did arise. </line>
<line> We gazed on those towers, we gazed on those domes – </line>
<line> But felt not much interest in mortar and stones, </line>
<line> So, turning away from the noble <cdplace>Carlisle</cdplace>, </line>
<line> We rested our eyes on the sea for a while. </line>
<line>  ̎How fruitless the ocean ̎, says Homer the poet; </line>
<line> The thought would be lovely, if all didn't know it. </line>
<line> But then Homer was wondering what it could mean </line>
<line> By being so barren and looking so green. </line>
<line> Sure never a green was so beauteous before, </line>
<line> Sure never a green will be so anymore, – </line>
<line> But some her will say that the ocean is blue, </line>
<line> For some people like to dispute on a hue. </line>
<line> Oh dear, what a habit – that of disputation – </line>
<line> I find it the cause of much great botheration. </line>
<line> And so, with these people, I will not dispute, </line>
<line> Nor their argumentations pretend to refute, </line>
<pb n="88"/>
<line> But some I'll affirm blue the ocean have seen </line>
<line> And others admired quite as lively a green, – </line>
<line> For, as changes the weather and changes the wind, </line>
<line> The ocean in like manner, changes its mind. </line>
<line> Straight boiling and chafing quite into a passion, </line>
<line> Not liking its colour, it changes the fashion. </line>
<line> When it lieth before us, quite calm and serene, </line>
<line> I need not then say that its colour is green – </line>
<line> Except when the sky that's above it is blue, – </line>
<line> And then need I say that is also its hue! </line>
<line> But when tired of these colours, it wants to be black, </line>
<line> Oh then it doth kick up a terrible rack, – </line>
<line> And rolling, and roaring, and chafing, and boiling, </line>
<line> Its noise is tremendous, – disturbed and turmoiling. </line>  
<line> When the waves with each other, quadrilling do dance, </line>
<line> From wondering <cdplace>England</cdplace> to wondering <cdplace>France</cdplace>, – </line>
<line> When the ocean scarce knoweth what it would be at – </line> 
<line> Oh need I then say,  ̎'Tis as black as my hat! ̎ </line> 
<line> But let us abstain from this learned disputation, </line>
<line> For, as I said before, I hate argumentation. </line>
<line> And now we did look to a distance surprising. </line>
<line> For we gazed where the hills of fair <cdplace>Scotland</cdplace> were rising. </line>
<line> How high beat our hearts as that land we surveyed, </line>
<line> Where so often the banner of freedom hath played; </line>
<line> Where Bruce to the battle his followers hath led, </line>
<line> Where Wallace hath fought, in whose cause he hath bled, </line>
<line> When freedom and glory arose in their breast, – </line>
<line> To death, or to conquest, how swiftly they prest, </line>
<line> And liberty's banner, and liberty's brand, </line>
<line> Broad, bloody, and bare, it forsook no their hand. </line>
<line> Now shifting the scene, much delighted we gaze </line>
<line> On the far-spreading shore, with its capes and its bays. </line>
<line> Till our wandering eyeballs were fixed, at last, </line>
<line> On the <cdplace>firth of the Solway</cdplace>, that wide sandy waste. </line>
<line> The tide, it was out, and the quicksands they lay </line>
<pb n="89"/>
<line> A smooth and inviting, but treacherous way, – </line>
<line> Though I think that a quicksand's a dangerous rogue, </line>
<line> And I don't think he's likely to come into vogue! </line>
<line> Then looked we where <cdplace>Saddleback</cdplace>, vast and gigantic, </line>
<line> Rears high his huge head, so old, and so antique. </line>
<line> His sides, furrowed deep by a thousand ravines </line>
<line> Which echo the roar of their mountian-born streams </line>
<line> As chafing and swelling by mossy crags bound, </line>
<line> Earth trembles beneath them and quakes at the sound. </line>
<line> How frowned the dark rocks, which bare, savage, and wild, </line>
<line> In heaps upon heaps were tremendously piled; </line>
<line> And how vast the ravines which, so craggy and deep, </line>
<line> Down dreadful descending, divided the steep. </line>
<line> Stay! hark to the eagle! how shrill is its cry, </line>
<line> From the breast of the hill which re-echoes on high! </line>
<line> Then, borne on the breezes which softly do play, </line>
<line> Tow'rd the fells of the <cdplace>Derwent</cdplace> it dieth away. </line>
<line> Again from those rocks it doth suddenly break, </line>
<line> And sounding as shrilly, it sweeps o'er the lake; </line>
<line> Then echoed again from gigantic <cdplace>Grassmoor</cdplace>, </line>
<line> And sharply rebounding from shore unto shore. </line>
<line> But where is the mountain-bird? Where doth he spring? </line>
<line> Where beats the breeze backward the flap of his wing? </line>
<line> Lo, See, where, impelled by his tempest-like force, </line>
<line> In cloud-hidden circles he wheels on his course; </line>
<line> O'er the rock-beating torrent he fearless is soaring: </line>
<line> Scarce hearing its thunder, that ne'er ceasing roaring. </line>
<line> Then turned we around to the maze of the mountains, </line>
<line> All teeming and sparkling with thousand bright fountains: </line>
<line> Where the brow of <cdplace>Helvellyn</cdplace> superior tow'r'd, – </line> 
<line> Where the beetling <cdplace>Scawfell</cdplace> so tremendously low'r'd, – </line>    
<line> Tost confus'dly in clusters all barren and grim, </line>
<line> While the clouds o'er their sky-braving battlements skim; </line>
<pb n="90"/>
<line> Till, their scarce-discerning outlines all misty and grey, </line>
<line> On the distant horizon they faded away. </line>
<line> Then far, far, beneath us, we giddily gaze </line>
<line> Where the spray-tossing wave of broad <cdplace>Bassenthwaite</cdplace> plays. </line>
<line> On the verge of the hill we precariously stood </line>
<line> And, awe-stuck, we gazed on the far-rolling flood. </line>
<line> Eternally murmuring, distant, and deep, </line>
<line> It stretched its coerulean waves at our feet. </line>
<line> Delighted and eagerly catching the view, </line>
<line> Our swift, eager eyes round the prospect we threw; </line>
<line> And, although in a cutting and cold situation, </line>
<line> We cared not to move from our high elevation, – </line>
<line> So, blowing our fingers and blowing our nose, </line>
<line> Not minding the cold that was pinching our toes, </line>
<line> And combating weather, and combating wind, </line>
<line> Still, still, at the summit, we lingered behind. </line>
<line> But as all of us knew, 'twas in vain to lament, – </line>
<line> So cheerfully all, we began the descent. </line>
<line> But as it was difficult, stoney, and steep </line>
<line> We judged it was better to trust to our feet, </line>
<line> And as none of us chose down the mountain to ride, </line>
<line> We left all our steeds to the care of the guide. </line>
<line> Now upon the descent I can not say much more </line>
<line> Unless I describe what I've told of before. </line>
<line> We came to the halting place – past by the rill, – </line>
<line> And mounted our steeds at the foot of the hill. </line>
<line> We forced through the bog, and we came to the dell </line>
<line> Where the murmurs of that sparkling rivulet swell, – </line> 
<line> Rode round about <cdplace>Latrigg</cdplace>, – to th' river came down, </line>
<line> And at last we did safely arrive in the town. </line>
<line> Now tell me, O reader, hast tasted repose </line>
<line> When toilings and labours have come to a close? </line> 
<line> Hast thou gloried when thou hast successfully toiled </line>
<line> In overcome dangers and diff'culties foiled? </line>
<pb n="91"/>
<line> Oh, then and then only, thou fitly canst tell </line>
<line> How our hearts lightly beat and our proud bosoms swell. </line>
<line> Delighted we sat round the bright blazing fire, </line>
<line> And talked of our hardships, – the mountain, the mire. </line>
<line> Though other things sink in the chaos of thought, </line>
<line> And fly from our mem'ry, let all be forgot, </line>
<line> As light chaff is borne on the face of the wind, </line>
<line> Yet <cdplace>Skiddaw</cdplace> shall ne'er be erased from our mind. </line>

<poem>
<line> The morning arrived o'er <cdplace>Shap fell's</cdplace> rugged crest; </line>
<line> Arose the bright sun in the gorgeous east; </line>
<line> But ah! far too swift flew the moments away, </line>
<line> And the hours strode along and dragged onward the day, </line>
<line> Till the moment arrived. We unwillingly gave </line>
<line> The last longing look to the islanded wave, </line>
<line> Regretting that now from its bosom we drove. </line>
<line> Tow'rds the wild moors of <cdplace>Penrith</cdplace> we silently rove; </line>
<line> Through the glen of the <cdplace>Greta</cdplace> a passage we found, </line>
<line> And round the huge <cdplace>Saddleback's</cdplace> forehead we wound. </line>
<line> By-the-bye, I should think he'd a good deal of sense, </line>
<line> For although his huge pate be prodigiously dense, </line>
<line> And although very leaden be his comprehension, </line>
<line> Yet his forehead I'm sure is of mighty extension; </line>
<line> And, sir, you perhaps may be recollecting </line>
<line> There are plenty of brains where the forehead's projecting. </line>
<line> The morning was lovely: the bright azure sky </line>
<line> With light, fleecy clouds, it was studded on high, </line>
<pb n="95"/>
<line> As if Jupiter's sheep from their fold they had strayed, </line>
<line> And o'er their blue meadows a ramble had made. </line>
<line> Perhaps you will say that the gods had no sheep! </line>
<line> Sir, I will not enter on argument deep. </line>
<line> But this I will say that you must recollect, sir, </line>
<line> That their goblets of gold were filled brimful of nectar: </line>
<line> And this to th' opinion perhaps may give rise, – </line>
<line> They had plenty of nectarine trees in the skies: </line>
<line> And as to their having a good flock of sheep, – </line>
<line> If they drank, I should think they had something to eat </line>
<line> And, although if they did not, I care not a button, </line> 
<line> The gods lived on something: Oh, why not on mutton? </line>
<line> But let me remember to whom do I speak, – </line>
<line> Perhaps to a man who knows nothing of Greek. </line>
<line> I don't condescend, sir, to talk to a loon' O, </line>
<line> Who perhaps knoweth nothing of Jove or of Juno! </line>
<line> And never, oh, never shall man be called by man </line>
<line> Who cannot translate &#960;&#949;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#945;&#957; </line>

<line> I return to my tale: from the mountains emerging, </line>
<line> Again towards <cdplace>Penrith</cdplace> our course we were urging. </line>
<line> <cdplace>Helvellyn's</cdplace> huge ranges arose on our right; </line>
<line> To the left <cdplace>Shap fell's</cdplace> crags at length bounded the sight; </line>
<line> <cdplace>Saddleback</cdplace> was behind us, and stretching before </line>
<line> Was a gloomy expanse of the heathery moor. </line>
<line> How different the scene from which we had been left; </line>
<line> And though all of us knew that those wishes were vain, </line>
<line> We all of us wished for the <cdplace>Derwent</cdplace> again. </line>
<line> But now our course changed; to the right we wheeled round, </line>
<line> Tow'rds the range of <cdplace>Helvellyn</cdplace> a passage was found. </line>
<line> Mellfell being past, by that huge range's side, </line>
<line> That's farthest from <cdplace>Keswick</cdplace> we gladly do ride. </line>
<line> Then entered among the luxuriant woods </line>
<line> Near <cdplace>Gowbarrow Park</cdplace> and dark <cdplace>Ulleswater's</cdplace> floods. </line>
<line> I've lost a good rhyme there, – it's <cdplace>Gowbarrow Park</cdplace> </line>
<pb n="97"/>
<line> And the waves of <cdplace>Ulleswater</cdplace>, so deep, and so dark </line> 
<line> I never lose rhymes, they are really the root, </line>
<line> There are three things that poetry good constitute – </line>
<line> Good rhymes are the first, and good measure the second, </line>
<line> And last, I believe, sense is usually reckoned! </line>
<line> But never allowed, I am sure, is digression, </line>
<line> So of my great sins I will make a confession </line>
<line> And hope that for them I may swiftly atone </line>
<line> To the reader impatient by now going on. </line>
<line> 'Mongst those beautiful woods now was winding the way, </line>
<line> For here they held almost tyrannical sway. </line>
<line> Near <cdplace>Gowbarrow Park</cdplace>, on the steep, rising heights, </line>
<line> Forest on forest, the vision delights; </line>
<line> Half nature, half art, had those forests upreared </line> 
<line> Till richly, they now on the mountains appeared, </line>
<line> And crested the crags, as the plumes of red </line>
<line> Wave o'er some warrior's helmeted-head. </line>
<line> Richly they stand, as their foliage bright, </line>
<line> Feathered and mantled each wave-washen height. </line>
<line> Till short, the road turned and we instant behold </line>
<line> A scene that was fit to be graven on gold. </line>
<line> Right in the front, all so dark and so deep, </line>
<line> Azurely gloomy lay <cdplace>Ulleswater's</cdplace> sheet. </line>
<line> Like a Leviathan resting there, </line>
<line> It lay all so mighty, so placid and fair; </line>
<line> Deeply deceitful, deceitfully calm, </line>
<line> As if it were bound by some wonderful charm. </line>
<line> As if it were shunning the gorgeous day, </line>
<line> Mountain embosomed, secluded it lay; </line>
<line> While beyond that so blue and so beautiful flood </line>
<line> The mighty <cdplace>Place-fell</cdplace> all so haughtily stood </line>
<line> And heaped his high crags so confusedly high, </line>
<line> As if boring a hole in the blue coloured sky. </line>
<line> Blue, blue did I say? What a monstrous mistake. </line>
<line> I am positive, sir, that it really is black. </line>
<pb n="98"/>
<line> What would'st contradict me? Now, sir, if you do, </line>
<line> I tell you I'll beat you both black and blue. </line>
<line> Now left we our carriage in order to go </line>
<line> To a tower, which they call <cdplace>Lyulph's Tower</cdplace> I know; </line>
<line> And also I know it belongs to a Duke, – </line>
<line> But which, to my readers, I leave to dispute, – </line>
<line> Where were some fine views and some huge horns of deer, </line>
<line> But nothing else worthy of mentioning here. </line>
<line> But now to our carriage returning, we drove </line>
<line> By <cdplace>Ulleswater's</cdplace> side, though no longer 'twas smooth, </line>
<line> For a breeze that was born 'mong dark <cdplace>Patterdale's</cdplace> fells </line>
<line> Each miniature billow, with anger, it swells; </line> 
<line> As puny, as vain, and as light as the fair </line>
<line> That woke its deep waters from slumbering there. </line>
<line> Now were I, oh, were I a proper lake-poet, – </line>
<line> (Although you will say, ̎'Tis in vain, – that, ̎ – I know it!) </line>
<line> But I cannot do what I know that I should, – </line> 
<line> Pop in an address to the nymph solitude. </line>
<line> Oh, beautiful, beautiful should my muse make her, </line>
<line> With a  ̎thou ̎ and a  ̎thee ̎, like the words of a Quaker. </line>
<line> All so fine –  ̎Thou companion of night, the black brow’d, </line>
<line> Who spreads o’er all nature her star-spangled shroud. ̎ – </line> 
<line> ‘Tis in vain, ‘tis in vain! I am not a lake-poet, – </line>
<line> I knew from the first on’t, that I couldn’t do it! </line>
<line> Oh pray, oh Melpomene, help me up there, </line>
<line> I never shall do for the fashion, I fear: </line>
<line> Spite of all the endeavour by poor me that made is, </line>
<line> I shall miss the applause of the misses and ladies. </line>
<line> Far contrary unto the laws that are writ </line>
<line> In natures own code, every miss makes a hit, </line> 
<line> At poor me and my rhymes, for they’re not sentimental, </line>
<line> And so to the – stop – to oblivion they’re sent all. </line>
<line> But the poets forget, when they praise solitude, </line> 
<pb n="99"/>
<line> That by rights upon her they should never intrude; </line>
<line> And therefore, if truly and rightly ‘twere known, </line>
<line> They praise her the best when they let her alone. </line>
<line> But I am digressive! Oh, I pray, do not blame me! </line>
<line> In description I know it would go on but lamely. </line>
<line> You know that description alone, it would be, sir, </line>
<line> A tedious thing that would tire you and me, sir. </line>
<line> All mountains and lakes would be very humdrum, </line>
<line> In a very short while you’d be wanting some fun. </line>
<line> You’d find, sir, in spite of the grand and sublime </line>
<line> A little ridiculous wanting in time. </line>
<line> It’s all very well to address melancholy, </line>
<line> And the night, and the morning, and other such folly; </line>
<line> Or a sonnet to night-loving, fair Philomel, – </line>
<line> In a fine Ladies’ Album these look very well. </line>
<line> But though you may think me prodigiously assical, </line> 
<line> I do like some fun – something that’s Hudibrastical. </line>
<line> Let every pert miss interrupt me in middle, </line>
<line> With a proper, school-bred, and genteel kind of giggle – </line> 
<line>  ̎I, I, ̎ – oh, dear me! – But I’ll make a confession – </line>
<line> I’m digressive when I do talk of digression. </line>
<line> ‘Tis enough: I go on. By the banks of the lake </line>
<line> Tow’rds fair <cdplace>Patterdale</cdplace> we our progress did take </line>
<line> And hoping each house that we saw on before </line>
<line> Would turn out the inn on the waves’ woody shore: </line>
<line> Though we wondering saw that our horses did trot </line>
<line> To the lake’s extreme end, and that still we stopped not. </line>
<line> And when full half a mile from its verge we advanced, </line> 
<line> Despair threw our minds in a wondering trance. </line>
<line> And certes not less than that distance we drive, </line>
<line> Until at the house, or the inn, we arrive. </line>
<line> Now, though I be called an egregious sinner, </line>
<line> I had not forgot at <cdplace>Ulleswater</cdplace> my dinner. </line>
<line> In the good open air it is well to be lunching, – </line> 
<line> You always see scenery best when you’re munching. </line>
<pb n="100"/>
<line> You’d think the view beautiful, if in his hand each </line>
<line> ‘Tween finger and thumb had a mustarded sandwich: </line>
<line> The mutton alive, which away from you fled, </line> 
<line> Would look better if you had a little on’t dead. </line>
<line> Remember old <cdplace>Skiddaw</cdplace>! The sandwiches there </line>
<line> Drove off all the cold of the rarefied air! </line>
<line> Can one relish a view without any provision – </line>
<line> Not at all fortified with the beef-ammunition? </line>
<line> Impossible! ‘Tis very well, sir, for you, </line>
<line> Who a good appetite, sir, perhaps never knew! </line>
<line> To say I am gluttonous and Epicurean, </line>
<line> Your opinion is founded, pray, tell me what surety on, </line>
<line> Save that I like some meat, – what can you do without it? </line>
<line> If you answer me aught you know nothing about it; </line>
<line> But I do forget that a noble red mullet </line>
<line> And some fine turtle soup has been stretching your gullet, </line>
<line> From a gallant tureen that’s full broad, and full deep, – </line>
<line> So swallow my rhymes, too, ‘ere you go to sleep! </line>   
<line> But now I continue my long-tailed oration </line>
<line> And tell you that now on the present occasion, </line>
<line> Impatient to sit round about the oak table, </line>
<line> We called for our dinner soon as we were able. </line>
<line> Now first was served up to us fine potted char; </line>
<line> Peculiar to some of the large lakes they are, – </line>
<line> Now <cdplace>Coniston’s</cdplace> the lake wherein they are largest, </line>
<line> But <cdplace>Windermere</cdplace>, <cdplace>Windermere</cdplace>, there, sir, they are best; </line>
<line> But those of <cdplace>Ulleswater</cdplace> to neither incline – </line>
<line> You can say nothing of them but  ̎They’re very fine! ̎</line>
<line> Now, sir, without arguing, snarling, or wrangling, </line>
<line> I’d dwell for a moment on fishing and angling </line>
<line> Because my <cdperson>Lord Byron</cdperson> has much deprecated it, </line>
<line> And mightily, mightily, much he has rated it; </line>
<line> And at it again was the good <cdperson>Doctor Johnson</cdperson>, </line>
<line> But I mustn’t face him, I’d as soon face a monsoon. </line>
<line> But the fish must be killed, and you won’t deny that, sir, – </line>
<pb n="101"/>
<line> You can’t catch a salmon just clean in your hat, sir! </line>
<line> You say to use nets, ay, and catch the poor things, </line>
<line> Half-strangled and stuck ‘mid the meshes and rings. </line>
<line> Our method at least gives a morsel of fly, </line>
<line> A bit of good dinner, before that they die! </line>
<line> Now when we somewhat had our hunger allayed, </line>
<line> Our knife and fork war for some moments we stayed, </line>
<line> Then looked at the sky, and consid’ring the weather, </line>
<line> Determined to take a short ramble together. </line>
<line> And first to the back of the house we went round </line>
<line> Where a huge, dirty dunghill, full quickly we found, </line>
<line> Beside it a puddle, where one dirty duck </line>
<line> With her brood swam, or paddled, or waddled, or stuck. </line>
<line> But we pushed past its dangers, in order to try </line>
<line> To ascend a small molehill, some fifty feet high, – </line>
<line> For though we could hardly call it elevation, </line>
<line> We thought for a view, ‘twas a good situation. </line>
<line> But scarce had we placed our foot on the first rock, </line>
<line> We suddenly, suddenly met with a stop. </line>
<line> ’Twas strange, passing strange, that the moment we came </line>
<line> Just forth from the threshold, the heavens would rain, </line>
<line> But although we did think they were much in the wrong, – </line>
<line> Oh, then how we, scampering, stumbled along. </line>
<line> Old Virgil himself could not tell how we flew, </line>
<line> With his Quadrupedante putrem sonitu. </line>
<line> But scarcely again had we got to the door </line>
<line> ‘Ere the sun and the sky became bright as before! </line>
<line> So we turned round about and clear ‘scaping their wrath, </line>
<line> Again trotted on, by a different path. </line>
<line> We came to a bridge, a bright streamlet thrown o’er, </line>
<line> Which licked with its ripples the pebbly shore. </line>
<line> ‘Tis a capital stream for a rod and a float, – </line>
<line> Perhaps for a salmon, perhaps for a trout. </line>
<line> Here and there on the banks, spread the roots of a tree, </line> 
<pb n="102 "/> 
<line> Whose other mossed members had ceased for to be; </line>
<line> While a fine bunch of fern o'er some eddies full deep, </line>
<line> For a chub, or a pike, made a noble retreat. </line>
<line> I believe 'mongst the lakes there is not such another – </line>
<line> These torrents do make such a terrible pother; </line>
<line> Bounce, bump on a rock, get a monstrous rebuff, </line>
<line> Then leap to another, repaid with a cuff, – </line>
<line> And boiling and foaming, quite into an eddy, </line>
<line> Attempts, but attempts it in vain, to be steady. </line>
<line> What fish could live there? Not a moment could they </line>
<line> 'Mongst the bright ripples dance, or in deep eddies play, </line>
<line> But dashed on the rocks, or all madly hurled o'er, </line>
<line> In some cataract's foaming, or tossed on the shore </line>
<line> Kick up such a stench as would poison a city </line>
<line> And excite e'en the lovers of angling to pity! </line> 
<line> But there's something in these, with their rout and their roar, </line>
<line> That pleases a poor, finless, biped on shore. </line>
<line> They roar to great length of both distance and time </line>
<line> Without any reason like this thing of mine. </line>
<line> Now we waded and walked where I need not now tell, – </line>
<line> By fell and by forest, by forest and fell. </line>
<line>  ̎Oh, what did you find, sir? ̎  ̎I found a – bird's nest. ̎</line>
<line> But though I could much this excursion expand </line>
<line> And the pen might run on like a goose in my hand, – </line>
<line> Yet I will not. Oh! there is so much generosity, </line>
<line> That first I would not balk your great curiosity, </line>
<line> And next, that I thought not my poem admired </line>
<line> When all those who heard it were noddingly tired! </line>
<line> Oh dear, it is hard to restrain this old pen </line>
<pb n="103"/>
<line> That will not hold in to the powers of men. </line>
<line> I am sure that it has but a goose understanding, </line>
<line> So monstrously, foolishly, always expanding. </line>
<line> But now I'll pass over a good deal of time </line>
<line> Without any reason, – nay more any rhyme, </line>
<line> Save remarking that we an excursion did take, </line>
<line> In the evening, down by the banks of the lake </line>
<line> And scarcely I think that it needs to be said, </line>
<line> That, when the night came, then we all went to bed. </line>
<line> The morning arrived. We rose mightily early </line>
<line> To see if the day dawned, or foully, or fairly. </line>
<line> Alas, where before from the window we'd seen </line>
<line> That mighty <cdplace>Placefell</cdplace>, the mists rolled between. </line>
<line> Where formerly heaped he his helmety top, </line>
<line> We saw not a fragment of mountain or rock. </line>
<line> And soon those same clouds which his summit concealed,</line> 
<line> Their troublesome, gloomy intentions revealed. </line>
<line> Oh dear, it was sad – for 'ere breakfast time came </line>
<line> The waters were circled with huge drops of rain. </line>
<line> Were the subjects of dark and of deep speculations. </line>
<line> Howe'er, we determined wherever they wintered </line>
<line> From our journey to <cdplace>Lowwood</cdplace> we would not be hindered, </line>
<line> So ordered the horses. Now, reader, prepare </line>
<line> For a tale shall rise up on thy caput thy hair. </line>
<line>  ̎What kind of a terrible tale is't? ̎  ̎What? ̎ said ye, – </line>
<line> Why, the impudence of a landlord and landlady. </line>
<line> When we, in a merry and fine happy mood, </line>
<line> We were just about to set off for <cdplace>Lowwood</cdplace>, </line>
<line> When up hopped a red-haired and sour-looking maid </line>
<line> Who made bold to tell us, now guess what she said, – </line>
<line> Why, that such a huge hill lay directly before, </line>
<line> We must somehow contrive to take two horses more. </line>
<line> There are many I know who when that had been said, </line>
<line> Instead of resisting it would have been glad; </line>
<pb n="104"/>     
<line> But these want all over grounds for to flee so </line>
<line> That they not genteel may appear for to be so! </line>
<line> But we, being confident in our gentility, </line>
<line> We would not aspire to the rights of nobility! </line>
<line> Could we now just say in our conscience take more </line>
<line> Than two, when a Lord does but lumber with four? </line>
<line> So to her landladyship's impudent face, </line>
<line> We said that we chose not to ride such a race, – </line>
<line> And that we (by the bye, 'twas a great condescension) </line>
<line> Would walk up the hill of such mighty extension. </line>
<line> But the draggle-tailed, blue-stocking, curlpaper pate </line>
<line> Began with a great affectation of state, </line>
<line> To inform us the hill was so high that she could not, – </line>
<line> (Which we found was a synonyme here with, ̎she would not ̎) </line>
<line> Allow us to climb up the mountain with two – </line> 
<line> And we would not object unto four if we knew </line>
<line> What a precipice guarded one side of the road </line>
<line> Which she hinted, to frighten us, wasn't too broad. </line>
<line> But I guess that the reason she ought to advance is </line> 
<line> A greedy desire to increase her finances! </line>
<line> Oh yellow-faced [greek], No, no 'tis [greek],</line>
<line> What a circle of evils is centred in thee, – </line>
<line> Ten thousands of evils may be thee, sir, made be </line>
<line> But chiefly the impudence of a landlady. </line>
<line> But methinks I do hear ever reader advising, </line>
<line> In the midst of the tour, not to stop moralizing! </line>
<line> We grew angry, and she, on no kind of condition </line>
<line> Would move from her obstinate, hilly position. </line>
<line> Oh, let every person who happens to see this, </line>
<line> Shun quickly a quarrel  ̎de quatuor equis, ̎ </line>
<line> For a landlady, fat as a huge roasted capon, </line> 
<line> In scolding, – how finely her words she will heap on! </line>
<line> And so we did find, for with arms stuck akimbo </line>
<line> (For which we did wish we could put them in limbo!) </line>
<pb n="105"/> 
<line> Stood out, oh most steadily, stiffly, and sternly, – </line>
<line> Unmoved as <cdplace>Helvellyn</cdplace> himself, and as firmly. </line>
<line> Till at length, as we saw 'twas in vain to dispute, </line>
<line> We gave up the argument and we were mute. </line>
<line> Soon saw we our carriage, encumbered with four, </line>
<line> On its wheels, swift revolving, roll round to the door. </line>
<line> We tried her again, for we thought not the sex able </line>
<line> To be all so monstrously, mighty, inflexible. </line>
<line> But we could not afford any longer to stop </line>
<line> When we found her so nearly akin to a rock, </line>
<line> So we called, having yielded to her as before, </line>
<line>  ̎Jack, hostler, here's sixpence – and now shut the door! ̎ </line>
<line> Off rapidly rolled we. Postillions two </line>
<line> Urged onwards the steeds, as fast forward we flew </line>
<line> And we found as the fellows did whip and did smack, it's </line>
<line> Prodigious fine fun to see two yellow jackets. </line>
<line> And as raising much dust, the four horses did jog, – </line>
<line> To see them, to see them, alternately bob. </line>
<line> So away from our mind angry feelings all flitted </line>
<line> And patiently unto our fate we submitted. </line>
<line> Now we came to a lake which seemed <cdplace>Ulleswater's</cdplace> daughter, – </line>
<line> Which they call a romantical name – <cdplace>Brothers' Water</cdplace>, – </line> 
<line> Because, (I am sorry to have the relating), </line>
<line> Two brothers were drowned here once when they were skating. </line>
<line>> It was clear, it was small, but we soon saw how steep </line>
<line> Was the gravelly shore that sloped down to the deep. </line>
<line> But we liked not its look, though its wave was so clear </line>
<line> It looked much more suspicious than fair <cdplace>Windermere</cdplace>. </line>
<line> So we passed by its waters and 'gan to look round </line>
<line> Where the mountains the valley more narrowly bound. </line>
<line> The fields got more narrow as onward we drove </line>
<line> And the stream wandered not by green island or cove. </line>
<line> More rocky, and foamy, and splashy, it grew, sir, </line>
<pb n="106"/>
<line> And began to get into a passionate humour. </line>
<line> No longer our road by the valley so low went, </line>
<line> But steeper and steeper it grew every moment, </line>
<line> Till the dell shot away into three good divisions, </line>
<line> All holding most mountainous, hilly, positions. </line>
<line> The course of the two it is not worth relating, </line>
<line> But one went straight forward without deviating. </line>
<line> Up this or by hook or by crook we must climb, – </line>
<line> Which we found would take up much trouble and time; </line>
<line> But there was unto <cdplace>Lowwood</cdplace> no other approach, </line>
<line> So picked up resolution, and then stopped the coach. </line>
<line> Though the road was full nearly akin to a river, </line>
<line> We got out and the carriage we left to the driver. </line>
<line> And walked up the hill, by the side of the stream, </line>
<line> Which rumbled fantastical rocks all between. </line>
<line> Now here's a fine place for a plump fifty lines, </line>
<line> But my muse no such needless extension designs, </line>
<line> Because if I wrote upon this any more </line>
<line> I should now describe what's described been before! </line>
<line> So through thick, and through thin, over bog, over rock, </line>
<line> I shall carry my reader at once to its top. </line>
<line> Oh, then was a time when we gazèd once more </line>
<line> Upon Windermere's woody and wavering shore; </line>
<line> On the gloomy ravine where we first saw the stream </line>
<line> Dash down the rude rocks 'mid that mountainous scene; </line>
<line> On the smoke which curled up to a slight elevation </line>
<line> From the tree-buried lum of the inn Salutation; </line>  
<line> On the bridge over which lay our <cdplace>Keswick</cdplace>-bound track, </line>
<line> When we left the fair scene to which now we came back; </line>
<line> On the house which we saw from our darling <cdplace>Lowwood</cdplace> – </line>
<line> By-the-bye, 'twas a beautiful nook where it stood: </line>
<line> 'Twas snugly embayed by the side of the lake, </line>
<line> Just where the two rivers do into it break. </line>
<line> I'd like such a house: – and yet, no, – I would not: </line>
<line> There's a circumstance I had completely forgot; </line>
<pb n="107"/>
<line> If these gingerbread houses – there now are but few, </line>
<line> And they rather improve, not disfigure the view, – </line>
<line> But I say, if these things were allowed to increase, </line>
<line> And disturb in that landscape its own native peace, </line>
<line> No longer 'twould be all so lovelily lone, </line> 
<line> And the mightiness, silence, and grandeur be gone. </line>
<line> But reader, I'm slow, and you'll go one without me: </line>
<line> I was in a parenthesis, looking about me! </line>
<line> We gazed upon all that was there to be seen, – </line>
<line> On the lake that was blue – on the fields that were green, – </line>
<line> On that dome of the sky, of such mighty extension, </line>
<line> And other small things that we needn't here mention. </line>
<line> But we stayed not our steps, for, the chariot entering, </line>
<line> We soon to our <cdplace>Lowwood</cdplace> were rapidly cantering. </line>
<line> And gallantly, gallantly onward we bore, </line>
<line> Till the driver reined up all our steeds at the door. </line>
<line> Bobbed out Mrs Jackson with  ̎How d'ye do, sir? </line>
<line> I hopes you're quite well; and miss, madam, and you sir? </line>
<line> Your beds are well aired, and your rooms are all ready. </line>
<line> Those horses are troublesome – steady, Jack, steady! </line>
<line> These flies do so teaze them. But pray, sir, come in; </line>
<line> It soon will be raining, sir; do come within! ̎ </line>
<line> While she all the time as these things she did say. </line>
<line> With her fat-butter personage, stopped up the way! </line>
<line> But when she at last did find out her mistake, </line>
<line> Full quickly the door, she did evacuate. </line>
<line> And then to the parlour and bedroom she brought us, </line>
<line> And we, very happily, took up our quarters. </line>
<line> Now, reader, I spare thee! At length will my pen </line>
<line> Its galloping course condescend to rein in: </line>
<line> For while the short week that I was not a rover </line>
<line> Full many adventures and things I pass over. </line>
<line> I could tell of the ladies, who wishing to row, sir, </line>
<line> Bumped the boat on a post with a terrible blow, sir, – </line>
<pb n="108"/>
<line> Then, poking it, wheeling it, dizzily round, </line>
<line> Gave a push; in a moment its keel was aground. </line>
<line> I could tell how we rowed full ten miles on the lake, </line>
<line> That's five to the station and five again back. </line>
<line> I could tell how we saw at the station was stationed </line> 
<line> A dog, oh, most agèd, most gentle, and patient, </line>
<line> As his hair, all so glossy and curly, did shine, </line>
<line> Save Pompey the best of the species canine. </line>
<line> I could tell how we went on a fishing excursion </line>
<line> And the rain drove us home 'ere a single immersion </line>
<line> Of our float could take place! What a monstrous vexation! </line>
<line> ( ̎Stop, pray, no digression. Go on with relation. ̎) </line>
<line> Let's see: —I could tell more than ever you'd read, sir; </line>
<line> So I'll give you one pleasant excursion instead, sir. </line>
<line> The people of <cdplace>Lowwood</cdplace> one opening day </line>
<line> Intended to cut for the horses the hay: </line>
<line> And said, when a moment the sun chose to shine, </line>
<line> That they were quite certain the day would be fine. </line>
<line> We trusted to them; they again, to the sky </line>
<line> Which told, and which looked, an egregious lie! </line>
<line> Oh Jove, naughty Jove, that did'st give such a thumper, </line>
<line> When you really intended to give us a plumper, </line>
<line> Why, tell me why, not a few signs in the air? – </line>
<line> But I will not reproach you, sir, for you don't care. </line>
<line> Quite prepared for the rain, but yet caring no less, </line>
<line> We thundered all off on the road to <cdplace>Bowness</cdplace>. </line>
<line> As forests beside us encircling, stood, </line>
<line> We rapidly bounded by field and by flood. </line>
<line> The road that we went on I shall not describe it, </line>
<line> For again we shall have in our carriage to ride it – </line>
<line> Nor even <cdplace>Bowness</cdplace>, – but at once I will carry </line>  
<line> Your wandering, galloping thoughts to the ferry. </line>
<line> The lake, like the tale of the bear and the fiddle, </line>
<line> Is almost cut off by two capes in the middle, </line>
<pb n="109"/>
<line> That the waters may not bar the path of the rover, </line>
<line> A kind of hobblety boat paddles over; </line>
<line> And in order to urge on its clumsiness fast, </line>
<line> They've got a huge oar that might do for a mast: </line>
<line> And, what is much worse, they have not got a sail, </line>
<line> That might catch in its foldings the breath of the gale. </line>
<line> So, o'er that dark water they limp and they lumber, </line>
<line> And over the lake they do bump and they blunder; </line>
<line> With us all behind, and the horses before, </line>
<line> And the coach in the centre, we get to the shore. </line>
<line> They tumbled us out as they bundled us in. </line>
<line> At the risk of immersing us up to the chin: </line>
<line> And instead of us paying, sir, they in a trice </line>
<line> Demanded and asked an exorbitant price! </line>
<line> But we could not avoid it, – so paid it; and then </line>
<line> We galloped by mountain, and torrent, and glen. </line>
<line> And although the wide heavens kept fair for a while, </line>
<line> Yet, ere we had passed by much more than a mile, </line>
<line> In lowering aspect began they to frown. </line>
<line> Then, – then, –  ̎Well, what then? ̎ – then the shower came down! </line>
<line>  ̎Oh, is that all? ̎ – Dear sir, pray what would you have more? </line>
<line>  ̎Oh, that's quite enough; but I knew it before. ̎</line>
<line> What, did you, sir? Dear me; 'twas much more than I did; </line>
<line> I knew not at all how it would be decided. </line>
<line> But anyhow, now, the decision's a bad one </line>
<line> To pepper us, 'deed, a prodigiously sad one. </line>
<line> We groaned in our hearts, but we did not complain, </line>
<line> When we knew, if we did so, the more it would rain. </line>
<line> But although we restrained all our anger for that, </line>
<line> When we saw the <cdplace>Old Man</cdplace> would keep on his night cap, </line>
<line> Oh! then we burst out in expressions of sorrow </line>
<line> And cries that it would not be fair till tomorrow. </line>     
<pb n="110"/>
<line> We looked on the mountains obscured by the rain; </line>
<line> We looked on the streams from their summits which came, </line>
<line> And, down into <cdplace>Coniston's</cdplace> waters careering, </line>
<line> With furrows full deep the dark mountains were searing; </line>
<line> No outlines were seen of their rock-broken form, </line>
<line> All darkly obscured by the mist and the storm. </line>
<line> While the fiend of the tempest howled loudly and long, </line>
<line> And the kelpie was yelling his ominous song, </line>
<line> And the eagle had flown to her nest in the rock, </line>
<line> And the caverns afforded a home for the flock. </line>
<line> And the birds sang not now to the murmuring floods, </line>
<line> For each of them fled to his home in the woods; </line>
<line> And the torrents in cataracts fiercely did pour, </line>
<line> And to their wild roaring re-echoed the shore; </line> 
<line> And bent to the force of the wind every tree </line>
<line> As that tempest was pouring its own melodie. </line>
<line> We gazed – though 'twas rather an unlucky time </line>
<line> For giving a taste of the grand and sublime, </line>
<line> As all on our carriage the showers did pelter, </line>
<line> We really began to look out for a shelter. </line>
<line> The driver also seemed in a terrible hurry </line>
<line> For he whisked round the corner, sir, all in a flurry. </line>
<line> He almost had tumbled us into the lake </line>
<line> For which it could never, I'm sure, be too late; </line>
<line> But we really and truly kept off very fairly, </line>
<line> Though he seemed for to think it could not be too early. </line>
<line> We bawled out,  ̎Hullo, ̎ and it was not too late, </line>
<line> For he trundled us gallantly up to the lake. </line>
<line> Although it was placed in a fine situation, </line>
<line> The inn did not equal our anticipation; </line>
<line> It might be the day, – and I will not deny it, – </line>
<line> For really the lake was most beautiful by it. </line>
<line> Of fair-weather prophecies mind you be wary, </line>
<line> For the day made old <cdplace>Coniston</cdplace> look solitary: </line>
<line> And, what made it worse, we had nothing to do, </line>
<pb n="111"/>
<line> Save watching the course of the clouds as they flew, </line>
<line> Or counting the ripples that rolled to the strand, </line>
<line> Or looking where lingered the slow minute-hand. </line>
<line> Or gazing full listlessly on the lone lake </line>
<line> And its waves as in impotent foaming they break; </line>
<line> Or watching the course of some light fishing skiff, </line>
<line> Or walking about in the room in a miff. </line>
<line> Sometimes we looked up at the troublesome sky, </line>
<line> And peeped through the breaks of the clouds, riding by; </line>
<line> Though we saw that they rather grew darker than thinner, – </line>
<line> Till a respite appeared in the entrance of dinner. </line>
<line> We were monstrously hungry; so do not you marvel </line>
<line> That we did not take time nor attempt for to carve well; </line>
<line> So went to the business at once, and indeed </line>
<line> For capital carving there wasn't much need; </line>
<line> So declared with the viands immediate war </line>
<line> And dined upon taties and fine potted char. </line>
<line> When dinner was over, as still it did rain, </line>
<line> We thought that we scarcely need longer remain: </line>
<line> So, ordered the carriage, and with no good will, </line>
<line> We ordered that pest of all travels – the bill. </line>
<line> May the money bear witness how quickly they made it! </line>
<line> – Much quicker than we were inclined to have paid it. </line>
<line> Though, without further grumbling, the silver we gave, </line>
<line> And galloped away from old <cdplace>Coniston's</cdplace> wave. </line>
<line> Yet, ere we should leave it in tempest and rain, </line>
<line> We, turning, looked back on its waters again. </line>
<line> With its deep-bosomed billows in front lay the lake, </line>
<line> Whose waters divided by mountain and cape, </line>
<line> All open and bare they, full lonely, did lie, </line>
<line> Exposing their breast to the shadowy sky: </line>
<line> Retiring in distance they mistily lay: </line>
<line> And fainter each inlet, and softer each bay; </line>
<line> Till, appearing no more, by the wild tempest tost, </line> 
<pb n="112"/>
<line> 'Mid mountains and clouds in the distance were lost. </line>
<line> Those mountains, all mistily softened away, </line>
<line> Appeared like thin clouds at the dawn of a day; </line>
<line> Still darker and deeper, in bolder relief, </line>
<line> As, nearer approaching, and rising the chief, </line>
<line> The mighty <cdplace>Old Man</cdplace>, with his dark summit reft </line>
<line> Nearer and sterner arose on our left. </line>
<line> Oh, such was the view, sir, and we very well did </line>
<line> Look over each spot as we amply beheld it, </line>
<line> Then turned and rode off, – but we took not the way </line>
<line> To the ferry of bungling boatmen which lay, </line>
<line> But through the lone wilds of the mountains we ride </line>
<line> Till the wheels bore us back to the fair Ambleside. </line>
<line> Then crossing the stream that to Windermere flowed, </line>
<line> We to <cdplace>Lowwood</cdplace> returned, by the oft-trodden road. </line>
<line> Oh good Mr Reader, it really's no fiction, </line>
<line> We had for our Lowwood a great predilection! </line>
<line> And many a ride, sir, and many a ramble </line>
<line> We took through the ditches, and hedges, to scramble; </line>
<line> And we oft had a dog, who, so very polite was, – </line>
<line> His canine behavior did really delight us, – </line>
<line> So sprightly, so eager, so sportive, so rompy, </line>
<line> Oh reader, devote a few moments to Pompey. </line>
<line> The dog was an honour to all of his kind, </line>
<line> As beauteous in body, as beauteous in mind, </line>
<line> If mind he could have. You may say, ̎He had none. ̎ </line>
<line> I only reply, ̎He'd a great deal of fun! ̎ </line>
<line> A capital racer, a capital swimmer, </line>
<line> What was more, he was not overfond of his dinner; </line>  
<line> And once when he walked on the banks of the lake, </line>
<line> A hare, had a hugeously, hair-breadth escape! </line>
<line> He caught a slight glimpse as she quiet was sitting, </line>
<line> And continued the chase, sir, without intermitting. </line>
<line> As hair-brained, he dashed through the wood with such speed, </line>
<pb n="113"/>
<line> We began for to think we had lost him, indeed! </line>
<line> Till far from the place where from us he departed, </line>
<line> At the turn of the road, from the thicket he started. </line>
<line> Though not at our sides for a moment he kept, </line>
<line> And many a time in the water he leapt, – </line>
<line> Then coming all wet, and all dirty, to bother us, </line>
<line> He shook in such style that he shook it all over us! </line>
<line> And swiftly he flung himself round with such might, </line>
<line> We really considered it quite unpolite. </line> 
<line> But enough of the dog. Now, good sir, I could tell </line>
<line> Of many a walk by the mountain and dell, </line>
<line> By torrent, and streamlet, and dark rocky bed, – </line>
<line> And of snake that erected and twisted its head, – </line>
<line> And of old <cdperson>Mr Wordsworth</cdperson> at <cdplace>Chapel of Rydal</cdplace> </line>
<line> Whom we had the honour of seeing, beside all. </line>
<line> Our sails on the lake, and our angling for naught, – </line>
<line> That being the sum of the fishes we caught! </line>
<line> The rest of our deeds I may leave you to guess, </line>
<line> So I spare you, and carry you off to <cdplace>Bowness</cdplace> </line>
<line> Where next in our carriage, so fine, we arrive, </line>
<line> Having had on the way to't a capital drive. </line>
<line> There, peacefully settling, next day being Sunday, </line>
<line> Agreed to set off for old <cdplace>Kendal</cdplace> on Monday. </line>
<line> In the morning for some little hill we inquired, </line>
<line> Full much of a view of the lake we desired. </line> 
<line> Then marched away briskly in search of a height, </line>
<line> By a road whose great beauty gave us much delight. </line>
<line> We gathered the moss to distinguish its kind, </line>
<line> Which the banks of the road in thick drapery lined; </line>
<line> And admired the fine trees that were clustering o'er us, </line>
<line> And gazed at the scene that was changing before us. </line>
<line> Until having walked something more than a mile, </line>
<line> We came to a gap in the hedge and a stile. </line>
<line> 'Tis none of your pleasant ones, such as you see </line>
<line> 'Twixt <cdplace>London</cdplace> and <cdplace>Hammersmith</cdplace>, – stuck to a tree, </line>
<pb n="114"/>
<line> One can clear in a moment; 'tis diff'rent shape. </line>
<line> You might as soon climb o'er a seven barred gate! </line>
<line> Howe'er we got over it and 'twas a wonder, </line>
<line> For you might have as easily scrambled it under! </line>
<line> Then perceiving a hill that was rising quite near, </line>
<line> We climbed it, and found it o'erhung <cdplace>Windermere</cdplace>. </line>
<line> We gazed and we saw the blue waves of the tide </line>
<line> Encircled by mountains. I needn't describe, </line>
<line> For we shall once more, by its waters careering, </line>
<line> Look up to the mountains in distance appearing </line>
<line> Ere we shall depart from the clear streaming rills </line>
<line> And bid a farewell to the land of the hills. </line>
<line> 'Tis enough. From the summit we gazed again, </line>
<line> Till startled, we were, by some droppings of rain. </line>
<line> We sprang from our station and dashed down the hill, </line>
<line> Although our departing was much 'gainst our will. </line>
<line> Hurrah! If you'd seen us when first it began </line>
<line> To rain on's you'd wonder to see how we ran, – </line>
<line> Each straining his stumps to get t'other before </line>
<line> Until we arrived at our landlady's door. </line>
<line> The changing of great-coats, the bonnets resigning, </line>
<line> Took up all the time to the hour of our dining – </line>
<line> During which operation the clouds ran away </line>
<line> And were beat from the field by the monarch of day. </line>
<line> So taking our vestments, now dried by the fire, </line>
<line> We took a short walk ere the day should expire. </line>
<line> 'Twas fair by the shore of the lake as we past </line>
<line> For the evening was loveliest, it was the last. </line>
<line> That we all the cares of the past day forgetting, </line>
<line> Should gaze on the rays of the sun that was setting – </line>
<line> Full balmy and soft was the summer breeze sighing, </line>
<line> And the birds sung a hymn to the sun that was dying. </line> 
<line> Half like a meteor red in the west, </line>
<line> He sunk by <cdplace>Scawfell</cdplace>, by his beetling breast </line>
<line> Which, distantly fading his radiance beneath, </line>
<pb n="115"/>
<line> Appeared like a cloud or a miswoven wreath. </line>
<line> And the steep <cdplace>Langdale Pikes</cdplace>, with their summits all riven, </line>
<line> Shone darkly and grim on the face of the heaven; </line> 
<line> While nearer, the hills to the lake fading down </line>
<line> In woody magnificence sternly did frown. </line>
<line> We gazed from the top of a light swelling rise </line>
<line> Till the evening's descent took us all by surprise. </line>
<line> Then homeward we hied with a great deal of sorrow, </line>
<line> For leaving the lakes and the mountains tomorrow. </line>
<line> The morning arrived. Oh! 'twas mournful indeed, – </line>
<line> The hours fled away with such terrible speed! </line>
<line> We entered the coach, and a last look we gave, </line>
<line> As – departing – we rode from the islanded wave. </line>
<line> We looked towards <cdplace>Coniston</cdplace>, looked to <cdplace>Scawfell</cdplace>, </line>
<line> And bade to those lakes and those mountains farewell. </line>
<line> Then swiftly away from the waters we flew, </line>
<line> Till the towers of old <cdplace>Kendal</cdplace> appeared on the view. </line>
<line> We past by those hills we had mounted before </line> 
<line> When our path lay direct for old <cdplace>Windermere's</cdplace> shore, </line>
<line> But with different feelings we now them beheld, </line>
<line> As following ridges successively swelled </line>
<line> And the sounds of farewell floated wild on the wind, </line>
<line> Returning to scenes we were leaving behind. </line>
<line> Farewell to the lake, and farewell to the mountain, – </line>
<line> The tarn, and the torrent, – the fall, and the fountain, – </line>
<line> To the deeps of the dell, and the wood-shaded shore; – </line>
<line> Thou land of the mountains, I see thee no more! </line>
