  <p>THE following account of <cdplace><i>Cro&#383;s-fell</i></cdplace> will entertain &#383;uch of your readers who&#383;e genius inclines them to the de&#383;cription of romantic &#383;cenes.</p>
  <p>A mountain that is generally ten months bury&#8217;d in &#383;now, and eleven in clouds, cannot fail of exciting the attention and curio&#383;ity of a traveller.</p>
  <p>That immen&#383;e ridge of mountains, which are reputed the <i>British Alps</i>, make their first appearance in <cdplace><i>Derby&#383;hire</i></cdplace>, and are thence continu&#8217;d in one chain of different elevations to the <cdplace>river <i>Tweed</i></cdplace>. The <cdplace><i>Lanca&#383;hire</i></cdplace> and <cdplace><i>Copland</i></cdplace> heights, with tho&#383;e in <cdplace><i>York&#383;hire</i></cdplace> and <cdplace><i>Durham</i></cdplace>, being only detach&#8217;d parts of this great body, &#383;uch as are remarkably eminent have particular names a&#383;&#383;ign&#8217;d them, whilst the general ridge bears one appellation for &#383;everal miles together.</p>
  <p><cdplace><i>Cro&#383;s-fell</i></cdplace>, tho&#8217; di&#383;tingui&#383;hed in none of our county maps, is mo&#383;t &#383;ingularly eminent, whether you regard its height, or the immen&#383;e ba&#383;e it &#383;tands on, being above 20 miles in circumference; in &#383;ome parts the ri&#383;e is very lei&#383;urely and gradual, in others more rugged and perpendicular, emitting con&#383;iderable &#383;treams to both &#383;eas. This in&#383;en&#383;ible a&#383;cent removes its top to a very great di&#383;tance from the inhabited plains, and being in a manner encompa&#383;&#383;ed with other de&#383;olate and barren mountains, it retains the &#383;now much  longer than any other we can &#383;ee in <cdplace><i>Britain</i></cdplace>, there being &#383;ome who affirm that it has continued &#383;ometimes for &#383;even whole years together.</p>

<pb n="385"/>
  <p><cdplace><i>Ald&#383;tone</i></cdplace> is the neare&#383;t town where one can get a &#383;afe conductor to cro&#383;s the&#383;e almo&#383;t impervious wa&#383;tes, a country extremely ill repre&#383;ented in all our maps yet publi&#383;hed, not to mention their exhibiting the towns on the wrong &#383;ide of the <cdplace>river [<i>Nint</i>]</cdplace>. About two in the afternoon we &#383;et forward three in company, and two who join&#8217;d us afterwards, out of the &#383;ame curio&#383;ity. We pa&#383;s&#8217;d the <cdplace>river <i>Tine</i></cdplace> near its confluence with <cdplace><i>Blackaburn</i></cdplace>, beyond which this immen&#383;e wa&#383;te begins, and could plainly perceive the alteration of air in riding a few miles. On the top of <cdplace><i>Roderic</i></cdplace> heights is a pretty large lake, call&#8217;d <cdplace><i>Green-ca&#383;tle-loch</i></cdplace>, which receives no vi&#383;ible feeder, but emits a &#383;mall &#383;tream northward to the &#383;aid burn; nor is there any ve&#383;tige of a ca&#383;tle, from which it could be pre&#383;um&#8217;d to borrow the name. The Swallows, tho&#383;e inconte&#383;table remains of <cdperson><i>Noah</i>&#8217;s</cdperson> deluge, begin here to be very frequent. Some of the&#383;e are 30 or 40 yards in diameter, and near as much deep, perfectly circular, but contain no water at any &#383;eason, the ground having gradually fallen in at the &#383;inking of the waters; but where they have happen&#8217;d amid rocks, the holes are left open to incredible depths. This naturally accounts for tho&#383;e &#383;urprizing ph&#230;nomena in the <cdplace><i>Pyrenean</i></cdplace> and <cdplace><i>Narbone</i></cdplace> mountains, and our <cdplace><i>Elden-hole</i></cdplace> in <cdplace><i>Derby&#383;hire</i></cdplace>, who&#383;e depths have never been a&#383;certained with the longe&#383;t lines.</p>
  <p>On the de&#383;cent of <cdplace><i>Roderic-fell</i></cdplace> there is plenty of herbage, but few plants, &#383;ave the &#383;corpioides arven&#383;sis, and tormentil.</p>
  <p>At the bottom of this height <cdplace><i>Blackaburn</i></cdplace> is divided into two branches, the ea&#383;termo&#383;t tumbling over a precipice of 40 perpendicular yards, which makes a mo&#383;t wild, &#383;urprizing ca&#383;cade.</p>
  <p>From this rivulet we are to account the ri&#383;e of <cdplace><i>Cro&#383;s-fell</i></cdplace>. We were now &#383;o much environ&#8217;d with large and extended mora&#383;&#383;es, rocks and mountains, that they exhibited a very frightful appearance, not the ve&#383;tige of a hou&#383;e, except &#383;ome old &#383;hiels, where in former ages the people had re&#383;orted like the A&#383;iatic Tartars to graze their cattle in &#383;ummer, a practice now quite di&#383;us&#8217;d. There were a few &#383;heep, but no deer, that we could &#383;ee, tho&#8217; there are &#383;everal on the heighs; and notwith&#383;tanding the extraordinary drought, the water follow&#8217;d our hor&#383;es foot&#383;teps for miles together, except where the ground was perfectly rotten. At a place call&#8217;d <cdplace><i>Bulmans cleugh</i></cdplace> there have been formerly lead-works, now left off. We had now a&#383;cended gradually about 3 miles, thro&#8217; very broken mora&#383;&#383;y wa&#383;tes, when the mountain began to ri&#383;e in three very formidable a&#383;cents, very &#383;teep, in the manner of <cdplace>mount <i>Lebanon</i></cdplace>, pil&#8217;d one above another, with large and exten&#383;ive plains to each of them, and loo&#383;e &#383;hivery &#383;tones on brows, very trouble&#383;ome to the hor&#383;es which we now were obliged &#383;ometimes to quit. This continu&#8217;d for near 2 miles more, when we got on the edge of the highe&#383;t, which forms a capacious plain of &#383;everal hundred acres, if you reckon from the Ea&#383;t a&#383;cent; but of &#383;uch a barren &#383;oil, that there was not &#383;o much as a &#383;ingle leaf or gra&#383;s, her or plant to be found in &#383;o large a plain, exclu&#383;ive of a few of tho&#383;erings attributed to fairies, &#383;ome of which are perfect circles of the <i>Gramen glumis variis</i>, in botany, a&#383;crib&#8217;d by <i>Linn&#230;us</i> in his de&#383;cription of the <i>Baltic</i> i&#383;les to a particular quality of its affecting the dirtie&#383;t &#383;oil, where no other gra&#383;s can thrive. This immen&#383;e plain has no verdure, therefore, but a venerably grey a&#383;pect from the mo&#383;s or down, and even this can hardly draw a &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence to &#383;upport it&#383;elf; &#383;o inconceivably barren is this di&#383;tingui&#383;h&#8217;d eminence. The We&#383;t &#383;ide towards the <cdplace><i>Cumberland</i></cdplace> plains is more rocky and &#383;teep than the way we a&#383;cended. Great part of &#383;ix counties were to be &#383;een, and notwith&#383;tanding our height, there &#383;eemed to be 4 or 5 mountains that di&#383;puted preheminence, the re&#383;t look&#8217;d all far below us. The&#383;e were <cdplace><i>Skiddow</i></cdplace> in the We&#383;t of <cdplace><i>Cumberland</i></cdplace>, <cdplace><i>Criffield</i></cdplace> in <cdplace><i>Scotland</i></cdplace>, <cdplace><i>Pennygent</i></cdplace> and <cdplace><i>Ingleborough</i></cdplace> in <cdplace><i>York&#383;hire</i></cdplace>, and the height <cdplace><i>Cheviot</i></cdplace> in <cdplace><i>Northumberland</i></cdplace>. I computed the diameter of our vi&#383;ible horizon to exceed 120 miles, 60 each way from the center. The mountains in <cdplace><i>Cleveland</i></cdplace> by the ea&#383;t &#383;ea were very fair, and the We&#383;t &#383;ea &#383;ufficiently di&#383;coverable. As to the perpendicular height of the mountain, I could not &#383;o well judge, having no barometer, and the top &#383;uffers too much by refraction to be a&#383;certain&#8217;d on geometrical principles.</p>
  <p>Whether it takes its name <cdplace><i>Cro&#383;s-fell</i></cdplace> from its tran&#383;ver&#383;e &#383;ituation to the common run of that ridge, or from a papi&#383;tical conjuring cro&#383;s to di&#383;lodge the aerial d&#230;mons, which that region has a&#383;cribed to this de&#383;olate mountain, I take not upon me to determine.</p>
  <p><i>P. S.</i> Being the 13th of <i>Augu&#383;t</i>, and a long drought, and a hot &#383;ea&#383;on, we were not able to find any the lea&#383;t relicks of &#383;now, in places mo&#383;t likely for it; which is very extraordinary.</p>
