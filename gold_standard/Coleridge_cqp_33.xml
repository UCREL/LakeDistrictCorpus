  In a prefatory note, Earl Leslie Griggs explains the textual history of this particular letter from Coleridge to Sara Hutchinson: 'Transcript Sara Hutchinson, in Mr. A. H. B. Coleridge's possession. Pub. 'Wordsworth and Coleridge', ed. by E. L. Griggs, 1939, pp. 150-7. The original of this letter [ . . . ] has disappeared, but the text has survived in the form of a journal made from them by Sara Hutchinson. This letter and the one following describe the first six days of a solitary tour, begun 1 August and completed 9 August, which carried Coleridge to the top of Scafell.' In order to facilitate a GIS mapping of Coleridge's tour of the Lake District, it has been necessary to create a 'new' text which brings together material from Coleridge's letters to Sara Hutchinson and material from his own notebooks. During the digitisation process, we have endeavoured to insert comments and notes on the textual sources.

<p>On Sunday Augt. 1st - half after 12 I had a Shirt, cravat, 2 pair of Stockings, a little paper &#38; half a dozen Pens, a German Book (Voss's Poems) &#38; a little Tea &#38; Sugar, with my Night Cap, packed up in my natty green oil-skin, neatly squared, and put into my <i>net</i> Knapsack / and the Knap-sack on my back &#38; the Besom stick in my hand, which for want of a better, and in spite of <person met="Y">Mrs C.</person> &#38; <person met="Y">Mary</person>, who both raised their voices against it, especially as I left the Besom scattered on the Kitchen Floor, off I sallied - over the Bridge<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Greta Bridge, Keswick</cdplace>-->, thro' the Hop-Field, thro' the <cdplace visited="Y">Prospect Bridge</cdplace> at <cdplace visited="Y">Portinscale</cdplace>, so on by the tall Birch that grows out of the center of the huge Oak, along into <cdplace visited="Y">Newlands</cdplace>--<cdplace visited="Y">Newlands</cdplace>is indeed a lovely Place-the houses, each in it's little Shelter of Ashes &#38; Sycamores, just under the Road, so that in some places you might leap down on the Roof, seemingly at least-the exceeding greenness &#38; pastoral beauty of the Vale<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Newlands Valley</cdplace>--> itself, with the savage wildness of the Mountains, their Coves, and long arm-shaped &#38; elbow-shaped Ridges-yet this wildness softened down into a congruity with the Vale<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Newlands Valley</cdplace>--> by the semicircular Lines of the Crags, &#38; of the bason-like Concavities. The Cataract <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Moss Force</cdplace>--> between <cdplace visited="Y">Newlands</cdplace> &#38; <cdplace visited="N">Kescadale</cdplace> had but little water in it / of course, was of no particular Interest- / I passed on thro' the green steep smooth bare <cdplace visited="Y">Kescadale</cdplace> / a sort of unfurnished Passage or antechamber between <cdplace visited="N">Newlands</cdplace> &#38; <cdplace visited="N">Buttermere</cdplace>, came out on <cdplace visited="Y">Buttermere</cdplace> &#38; drank Tea at the little Inn<!--<inn inn_visited="Y">Fish Inn, Buttermere</inn>-->, &#38; read the greater part of the Revelations-the only part of the New Testament, which the <person met="N">Scotch Cobler</person> read-because why? <i>Because it was the only part that he understood.</i> O 'twas a wise Cobler! . . .</p>


 <p>Conceive an enormous round Bason mountain-high of solid Stone / cracked in half &#38; one half gone / exactly in the remaining half of this enormous Bason, does <cdplace visited="Y">Buttermere</cdplace> lie, in this <gap desc="Small diagram at this point which is not reproduced here."/>beautiful &#38; stern Embracement of Rock / I left it, passed by <cdplace visited="Y">Scale Force</cdplace>, the white downfal of which glimmered thro' the Trees, that hang before it like bushy Hair over a madman's Eyes, and climbed 'till I gained the first Level / here it was 'every man his own pathmaker,' &#38; I went directly cross it-upon soft mossy Ground, with many a hop, skip, &#38; jump, &#38; many an occasion for observing the Truth of the old Saying: where Rushes grow, A Man may go. <cdplace visited="N">Red Pike</cdplace>, a dolphin-shaped Peak of a deep red, looked in upon me from over the Fell<!--<cdplace visited="N">Dodd</cdplace>--> on my Left, on my right  I had, first <cdplace visited="N">Melbreak</cdplace> (the Mountain on the right of <cdplace visited="N">Crummock</cdplace>, as you ascend the Lake<!--<cdplace visited="N">Crummock Water</cdplace>-->) then a Vale <!--<cdplace visited="N">Mosedale</cdplace>--> running down with a pretty Stream<!--<cdplace visited="N">Mosedale Beck</cdplace>--> in it, to <cdplace visited="N">Loweswater</cdplace> / then <cdplace visited="N">Heck Comb</cdplace><!--<ed_comment>Hen Comb</ed_comment>-->, a Fell of the same height &#38; running in the same direction with <cdplace visited="N">Melbreak</cdplace>, a Vale on the other side too,-and at the bottom of both these Vales the <cdplace visited="N">Loweswater Fells</cdplace> running abreast. Again I reached an ascent <!--<cdplace visited="N">Floutern Pass</cdplace>-->, climbed up &#38; came to a ruined Sheepfold <!--<cdplace visited="N">Floutern Pass</cdplace>-->-a wild green view all around me, bleating of Sheep &#38; noise of waters-I sate there near 20 minutes, the Sun setting on the Hill behind with a soft watery gleam; &#38; in front of me the upper Halves of huge deep-furrowed <cdplace visited="N">Grasmire</cdplace><!--<ed_comment>Grassmoor</ed_comment>--> (the mountain on the other side of <cdplace visited="N">Crummock</cdplace>) &#38; the huge <cdplace visited="N">Newland</cdplace> &#38; <cdplace visited="N">Buttermere</cdplace> Mountains, &#38; peeping in from behind the Top of <cdplace visited="N">Saddleback</cdplace>. Two Fields were visible, the highest cultivated Ground on the <cdplace visited="N">Newland</cdplace> side of <cdplace visited="N">Buttermere</cdplace>, and the Trees in those Fields were the only trees visible in the whole Prospect.-I left the Sheepfold <!--<cdplace visited="N">Floutern Pass</cdplace>--> with regret-for of all things a ruined Sheepfold in a desolate place is the dearest to me, and fills me most with Dreams &#38; Visions &#38; tender thoughts of those I love best.</p>


 <p>-Well! I passed a bulging roundish-headed green Hill <!--It is possible that Coleridge is referring to<cdplace visited="N">Little Dodd</cdplace>-->to my Left, (and to the left of it was a frightful Crag <!--It is possible that Coleridge is referring to<cdplace visited="N">Red Pike</cdplace>-->) with a very high round-head <!--<cdplace visited="N">Starling Dodd</cdplace>--> right before me; this latter is called <cdplace visited="N">Ennerdale-Dodd</cdplace><!--Presumably Coleridge is referring to the fell now known as Starling Dodd-->, and bisects the ridge between <cdplace visited="N">Ennerdale</cdplace> &#38; <cdplace visited="N">Buttermere</cdplace> &#38; <cdplace visited="N">Crummock</cdplace>-I took it on my right hand, &#38; came to the top of the bulging green Hill, on which I found a small Tarn, called <cdplace visited="Y">Flattern Tarn</cdplace><!--`<ed_comment>Floutern Tarn</ed_comment>-->, about 100 yds. in length, &#38; not more than 7 or 8 in breadth, but O! what a grand Precipice it lay at the foot of! The half of the Precipice (called <cdplace visited="N">Herd House</cdplace><!--Herdus-->) nearest to <cdplace visited="N">Ennerdale</cdplace> was black, with green moss-cushions on the Ledges; the half nearest to <cdplace visited="N">Buttermere</cdplace> a pale pink<!--It is possible that Coleridge is referring to the fell of<cdplace visited="N">Great Borne</cdplace>-->, &#38; divided from the black part by a great streamy Torrent of crimson Shiver, &#38; Screes, or Shilly (as they call it). I never saw a more heart-raising Scene. I turned &#38; looked on the Scene which I had left behind, a marvellous group of mountains, wonderfully &#38; admirably arranged-not a single minute object to interrupt the oneness of the view, excepting those two green Fields in <cdplace visited="N">Buttermere</cdplace>-but before me the glorious Sea <!--<cdplace visited="N">Irish Sea</cdplace>--> with the high Coast &#38; Mountains of the <cdplace visited="N">Isle of Mann</cdplace>, perfectly distinct-&#38; three Ships in view.</p>

<p>A little further on, the <cdplace visited="N">Lake of Ennerdale</cdplace> (the lower part of it) came into view, shaped like a clumsy battle-dore-but it is, in reality, exactly <i>fiddle-shaped</i>. The further Bank &#38; the higher part, steep, lofty, bare bulging Crags <!--<cdplace visited="N">Crag Fell</cdplace>--> ; the nether Bank green &#38; pastoral, with Houses in the shelter of their own dear Trees.-On the opposite Shore in the middle &#38; narrow part of the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="N">Ennerdale Water</cdplace>--> there bulges out a huge Crag, called <cdplace visited="N">angling Stone</cdplace><!--Anglers Crag--> / being a famous Station for anglers-and the reflection of this Crag <!--<cdplace visited="N">Anglers Crag</cdplace>--> in the Water <!--<cdplace visited="N">Ennerdale Water</cdplace>--> is admirable-pillars or rather it looks like the pipes of some enormous Organ in a rich golden Color.-I travelled on to <cdplace visited="Y">Long Moor</cdplace><!--Longmoor-->, two miles below the Foot of the Lake<!--<cdplace visited="N">Ennerdale Water</cdplace>-->, &#38; met a very hearty welcome from <person met="Y">John Ponsonby</person>, a Friend of <person met="N">Mr. Jackson's</person>-here I stayed the night <!--<ed_comment>[1 August]</ed_comment>--> &#38; the greater part of Monday.<!--</day>--></p>

 <p>Breakfasted there <!--Unknown 'Pot-house' at St. Bees-->-and went to the School <!--<cdplace visited="Y">St. Bees School</cdplace>--> &#38; Church ruins <!--<cdplace visited="Y">St. Bees Priory</cdplace>--> - had read in the history of Cumbd. <!--'History and Antiquities of Cumberland' by William Hutchinson, 2 volumes, 1794--> that there was an 'excellent Library presented to the School by <person met="N">James Lowther</person>,' which proved to be some 30 odd Volumes of commentaries on the Scripture utterly worthless-amp which with all my passion for ragged old Folios I should certainly make serviceable . . . for fire-lighting. Men who write Tours and County histories I have by woeful experience found out to be <i>damned Liars</i>, harsh words, but true!-It was a wet woeful oppressive morning-I was sore with my bad night-walked down to the Beach <!--St. Bees-->, which is a very nice hard Sand for more than a mile / but the <cdplace visited="U">St. Bees Head</cdplace> which I had read much of as a noble Cliff, might be made a song of on the Flats of the Dutch Coast-but in England 'twill scarcely bear a looking-at.

 <p>After Breakfast, had a pleasant walk to <cdplace visited="Y">Calder Abbey</cdplace>-an elegant but not very interesting Ruin, joining to a very hansome Gentleman's House <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Abbey House</cdplace>--> built of red freestone, which has the comfortable warm look of Brick without it's meanness and multitude of puny squares. This place lies just within the Line of circumference of <i>a Circle</i> of woody Hills-the area, a pretty Plain half a mile perhaps in diameter-and completely cloathed &#38; hid with wood, except one red hollow in these steep hills, &#38; except behind the Abbey, where the Hills are far higher, &#38; consist of green Fields almost (but not quite) to the Top. Just opposite to <cdplace visited="Y">Calder Abbey</cdplace>, &#38; on the Line of the Circumference, rises <cdplace visited="N">Ponsonby Hill</cdplace>, the Village of <cdplace visited="N">Calder Bridge</cdplace>, &#38; it's interesting Mill, all in Wood, some hidden, some roofs just on a line with the Trees, some higher, but <cdplace visited="N">Ponsonby Hall</cdplace> far higher than the rest.- I regained the Road, and came to <!--<inn inn_visited="Y">-->Bonewood<!--</inn>,--> a single Alehouse on the top of the hill above the Village <cdplace visited="N">Gosforth</cdplace>-drank a pint of Beer (I forgot to tell you that the whole of my expences at <cdplace visited="N">St. Bees</cdplace>, a glass of Gin &#38; Water, my Bed, &#38; Breakfast amounted to 11d.)-from this <!--<inn inn_visited="Y">-->Bonewood<!--</inn>--> is a noble view of the <cdplace visited="N">Isle of Man</cdplace> on the one side, &#38; on the other side all the bold dread tops of the <cdplace visited="N">Ennerdale</cdplace> &#38; <cdplace visited="N">Wastdale</cdplace> Mountains / . Indeed the whole way from <cdplace visited="Y">Egremont</cdplace> I had beautiful Sea Views, the low hills to my right dipping down into inverted Arches, or Angles, &#38; the Sea <!--<cdplace visited="N">Irish Sea</cdplace>-->, often with a Ship seen thro'-while on my left the <cdplace visited="N">the Steeple</cdplace><!--Sca Fell Pike??-->, &#38; <cdplace visited="N">Sca' Fell</cdplace> facing each other, far above the other Fells, formed in their interspace a great Gap in the Heaven.-So I went on, turned eastward, up the <cdplace visited="Y">Irt</cdplace>, the Sea <!--<cdplace visited="N">Irish Sea</cdplace>--> behind &#38; <cdplace visited="N">Wastdale</cdplace> Mountains before-&#38; here I am <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Nether Wasdale</cdplace>-->-</p>

<p>Wed. Afternoon half past 3, Augt. 4th 1802-</p>

<p><cdplace visited="Y">Wastdale</cdplace><!--Nether Wasdale-->, a mile &#38; half below the Foot of the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="N">Wast Water</cdplace>-->, at an Alehouse without a Sign <!--<inn inn_visited="Y">-->Inn <!--The public house is now called The Screes Inn, Nether Wasdale--><!--</inn>-->, 20 strides from the Door, under the Shade of a huge Sycamore Tree, without my coat-but that I will now put on, in prudence-yes here I am / and have been for something more than an hour, &#38; have <i>enjoyed</i> a good Dish of Tea (I carried my Tea &#38; sugar with me) under this delightful Tree. In the House <!--<inn inn_visited="Y">-->Inn <!--The Screes Inn, Nether Wasdale--><!--</inn>--> there are only a feeble <person met="Y">Woman</person>, and a <i>'Tallyeur'</i><!--<person met="Y">A tailor</person>--> Lad upon the Table-all the rest of the <cdplace visited="Y">Wastdale</cdplace> World is a haymaking, rejoicing and thanking God for this first downright summer Day that we have had since the beginning of May.-And now I must go &#38; see the Lake<!--<cdplace visited="N">Wast Water</cdplace>--> / for immediately at the Foot of the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="N">Wast Water</cdplace>--> runs a low Ridge so that you can see nothing of the Water <!--<cdplace visited="N">Wast Water</cdplace>--> till you are at it's very Edge.</p>

<p>Between the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="N">Wast Water</cdplace>--> and the Mountains <!--<cdplace visited="N">Seatallan</cdplace> and <cdplace visited="N">Yewbarrow</cdplace>--> on the left, a low ridge of hill <!--<cdplace visited="U">Wast Water [north-western shore]</cdplace>--> runs parallel with the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="N">Wast Water</cdplace>-->, for more than half it's length; &#38; just at the foot of the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="N">Wast Water</cdplace>--> there is a Bank even &#38; smooth &#38; low like a grassy Bank in a Gentleman's Park. Along the hilly Ridge I walked thro' a Lane of green Hazels, with hay-fields &#38; Hay-makers on my Right, beyond the <cdplace visited="N">River Irt</cdplace>, &#38; on the other side of the River <!--<cdplace visited="N">River Irt</cdplace>-->, <cdplace visited="N">Irton Fell</cdplace> with a deep perpendicular Ravine &#38; a curious fretted Pillar of Clay crossier-shaped, standing up in it-next to <cdplace visited="N">Ireton Fells</cdplace> &#38; in the same line as the <cdplace visited="N">Screes</cdplace>, &#38; you can look at nothing but the <cdplace visited="N">Screes</cdplace> tho' there were 20 quaint Pillars close by you. The Lake <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Wast Water</cdplace>--> is wholly hidden 'till your very Feet touch it, as one may say / and to a Stranger the Burst would be almost overwhelming. The Lake <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Wast Water</cdplace>--> itself seen from it's Foot appears indeed of too regular shape; exactly like the sheet of Paper on which I am writing, except it is still narrower in respect of it's length. (In reality however the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Wast Water</cdplace>--> widens as it ascends, and at the head is very considerably broader than at the foot.) But yet, in spite of this it <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Wast Water</cdplace>--> is a marvellous sight / a sheet of water between 3 &#38; 4 miles in length, the whole (or very nearly the whole) of it's right Bank formed by the <cdplace visited="N">Screes</cdplace>, or facing of bare Rock of enormous Height, two thirds of it's height downwards almost perpendicular; &#38; then slanting off in <i>Screes</i>, or Shiver, consisting of fine red Streaks running in broad Stripes thro' a stone colour-slanting off from the Perpendicular, as steep as the meal newly ground from the Miller's spout.-So it is at the foot of the Lake<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Wast Water</cdplace>-->; but higher up this streaky Shiver occupies two thirds of the whole height, like a pointed Decanter in shape, or an outspread Fan, or a long-waisted old maid with a fine prim Apron, or-no, other things that would only fill up the Paper.</p>

<p>When I first came the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Wast Water</cdplace>--> was a perfect Mirror; &#38; what must have been the Glory of the reflections in it! This huge facing of Rock <i>said</i> to be half a mile in perpendicular height, with deep Ravin<!--<ed_comment>[e]</ed_comment>-->s the whole <i>winded</i> <!--<ed_comment>[wrinkled?]</ed_comment>--> &#38; torrent-worn, except where the pink-striped <cdplace visited="N">Screes</cdplace> come in, as smooth as silk / all this reflected, turned into Pillars, dells, and a whole new-world of Images in the water! The head of the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Wast Water</cdplace>--> is crowned by three huge pyramidal mountains, <cdplace visited="N">Yew-barrow</cdplace>, <cdplace visited="N">Sca' Fell</cdplace>, &#38; the <cdplace visited="N">great Gavel</cdplace>;  <cdplace visited="N">Yewbarrow</cdplace> &#38; <cdplace visited="N">Sca'Fell</cdplace> nearly opposite to each other, yet so that the <i>Ness</i> (or Ridge-line, like the line of a fine Nose,) of <cdplace visited="N">Sca' Fell</cdplace> runs in behind that of <cdplace visited="N">Yewbarrow</cdplace>, while the Ness of <cdplace visited="N">great Gavel</cdplace> is still farther back, between the two others, &#38; of course, instead of running athwart the Vale <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Wasdale</cdplace>--> it directly faces you. <!--At this stage in his edition of Coleridge's 'Collected Letters', Griggs reproduces Coleridge's line drawing of the shape of Wast Water.--> The Lake <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Wast Water</cdplace>--> &#38; Vale <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Wasdale</cdplace>--> run nearly from East to west and this figure below will give you some idea of it.-<!--In a footnote to his edition of Coleridge's 'Collected Letters', Griggs inserts a note from Sara Hutchinson: 'But the Transcriber has not ingenuity enough to copy it, nor the full length Portrait of the Author-so they must be dispensed with-'--></p>

<p>Melfell <!--<ed_comment>[<cdplace visited="N">Middle Fell</cdplace>]</ed_comment>--> (lying South <!--<ed_comment>[North]</ed_comment>--> of the Lake <!--<cdplace visited="N">Wast Water</cdplace>-->) consists of great mountain steps decreasing in size as they approach the Lake.</p>

<p>My Road led along under <cdplace visited="N">Melfell</cdplace><!--Middle Fell--> &#38; by <cdplace visited="N">Yewbarrow</cdplace>-&#38; now I came in sight of it's other side called <cdplace visited="N">Keppel Crag</cdplace> &#38; then a huge enormous bason-like Cove called <cdplace visited="N">Green Crag</cdplace> <!--<ed_comment>[Red Pike?]</ed_comment>--> / as I suppose, from there being no single Patch of Green to be seen on any one of it's perpendicular sides-so on to <cdplace visited="N">Kirk Fell</cdplace>, at the foot of which is <person met="N">Thomas Tyson</person>'s House <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Burnthwaite, Wasdale Head</cdplace>--> where <person met="N">W<!--<ed_comment>[ordsworth]</ed_comment>--></person> &#38; I slept Novr. will be 3 years-&#38; there <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Wasdale Head</cdplace>--> I was welcomed kindly, had a good Bed, and left it after Breakfast.</p><!--</day>-->

<p>And here I am so <i>lounded</i>-so fully lounded-that tho' the wind is strong, &#38; the Clouds are hast'ning hither from the Sea <!--<cdplace visited="N">Irish Sea</cdplace>-->-and the whole air seaward has a lurid Look-and we shall certainly have Thunder-yet here (but that I am hunger'd &#38; provisionless) <i>here</i> I could lie warm, and wait methinks for tomorrow's Sun / and on a nice Stone Table am I now at this moment writing to you-between 2 and 3 o'Clock as I guess / surely the first Letter ever written from the Top of <cdplace visited="Y">Sca' Fell</cdplace>! But O! what a look down just under my Feet! The frightfullest Cove <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Scafell Crag</cdplace>--> that might ever be seen / huge perpendicular Precipices, and one Sheep upon it's only Ledge, that surely must be crag! <person met="N">Tyson</person> told me of this place, &#38; called it <cdplace visited="Y">Hollow Stones</cdplace>. Just by it &#38; joining together, rise two huge Pillars of bare lead-colored stone- / I am no measurer / but their height &#38; depth is terrible. I know how unfair it is to judge of these Things by a comparison of past Impressions with present-but I have no shadow of hesitation in saying that the Coves &#38; Precipices of <cdplace visited="N">Helvellin</cdplace> are nothing to these! But <!--<ed_comment>[from]</ed_comment> -->this sweet lounding Place I see directly thro' <cdplace visited="N">Borrowdale</cdplace>, the <cdplace visited="N">Castle Crag</cdplace>, the whole of <cdplace visited="N">Derwent Water</cdplace>, &#38; but for the haziness of the Air I could see own House <!--<cdplace visited="N">Greta Hall, Keswick</cdplace>-->-I see clear enough where it stands-</p>

<p>Here I will fold up this Letter-I have Wafers in my Inkhorn / &#38; you shall call this letter when it passes before you the <cdplace visited="Y">Sca' Fell</cdplace> Letter <!--<ed_comment>In a footnote, Griggs indicates that: '"The Sca' Fell Letter" was posted to Sara Hutchinson at Gallow Hill, Yorkshire, from Ambleside on Sunday evening, 8 Aug [ . . . ] The transcript contains no conclusion or signature.</ed_comment>-->/-I must now drop down, how I may into <cdplace visited="N">Eskdale</cdplace>-that lies under to my right-the upper part of it <!--Eskdale--> the wildest &#38; savagest surely of all the Vales that were ever seen from the Top of an English Mountain / and the lower part the loveliest.-</p>

<p><!--Coleridge's letter to <person met="N">Sara Hutchinson</person> ends with the above comments; but he continues his account of his descent of <cdplace visited="Y">Sca Fell</cdplace> in a second letter to Sara, written on 6 August 1802. In order to facilitate a GIS mapping of Coleridge's walking tour of the Lakes, there is a need to bring together these two sources and to treat the letter of 6 August 1802 as a natural continuation of that dated 5 August 1802.-->There is one sort of gambling, to which I am much addicted; and that not of the least criminal kind for a man who has children &#38; a concern. It is this. When I find it convenient to descend from a mountain, I am too confident &#38; too indolent to look round about &#38; wind about 'till I find a track or other symptom of safety; but I wander on, &#38; where it is first <i>possible</i> to descend, there I go-relying upon fortune for how far down this possibility will continue. So it was yesterday afternoon <!--5 August 1802-->. I passed down from <cdplace visited="Y">Broadcrag</cdplace>, skirted the Precipices<!--<cdplace visited="N">Scafell Crag</cdplace>-->, and found myself cut off from a most sublime Crag-summit<!--<cdplace visited="N">Scafell Pike</cdplace>-->, that seemed to rival <cdplace visited="N">Sca' Fell Man</cdplace> in height, &#38; to outdo it in fierceness. A Ridge of Hill <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Mickledore Ridge</cdplace>--> lay low down, &#38; divided this Crag (called <cdplace visited="N">Doe-crag</cdplace>) &#38; <cdplace visited="N">Broad-crag</cdplace>-even as the Hyphen divides the words broad &#38; crag. I determined to go thither; the first place I came to, that was not direct Rock, I slipped down, &#38; went on for a while with tolerable ease-but now I came (it was midway down) to a smooth perpendicular Rock about 7 feet high-this was nothing-I put my hands on the Ledge, &#38; dropped down / in a few yards came just such another / I <i>dropped</i> that too / and yet another, seemed not higher-I would not stand for a trifle / so I dropped that too / but the stretching of the muscle<!--<ed_comment>[s]</ed_comment>--> of my hands &#38; arms, &#38; the jolt of the Fall on my Feet, put my whole Limbs in a <i>Tremble</i>, and I paused, &#38; looking down, saw that I had little else to encounter but a succession of these little Precipices-it was in truth a Path that in a very hard Rain is, no doubt, the channel of a most splendid Waterfall.<!--Here, Coleridge is describing his famous descent of <cdplace visited="Y">Broad Stand</cdplace>--></p>

 <p>So I began to suspect that I ought not to go on / but then unfortunately tho' I could with ease drop down a smooth Rock 7 feet high, I could not <i>climb</i> it / so go on I must / and on I went / the next 3 drops were not half a Foot, at least not a foot more than my own height / but every Drop increased the Palsy of my Limbs-I shook all over, Heaven knows without the least influence of Fear / and now I had only two more to drop down / to return was impossible-but of these two the first was tremendous / it was twice my own height, &#38; the Ledge at the bottom was <!--<ed_comment>[so]</ed_comment>--> exceedingly narrow, that if I dropt down upon it I must of necessity have fallen backwards &#38; of course killed myself. My Limbs were all in a tremble-I lay upon my Back to rest myself, &#38; was beginning according to my Custom to laugh at myself for a Madman, when the sight of the Crags above me on each side, &#38; the impestuous Clouds just over them, posting so luridly &#38; so rapidly northward, overawed me / I lay in a state of almost prophetic Trance &#38; Delight-&#38; blessed God aloud, for the powers of Reason &#38; of the Will, which remaining no Danger can overpower us! O God, I exclaimed aloud-how calm, how blessed am I now / I know not how to proceed, how to return / but if I am calm &#38; fearless &#38; confident / if this Reality were a Dream, if I were asleep, what agonies had I suffered! what screams!-When the Reason &#38; the Will are away, what remain to us but Darkness &#38; Dimness &#38; a bewildering shame, and Pain that is utterly Lord over us, or fantastic Pleasure, that draws the Soul along swimming through the air in many shapes, even as a Flight of Starlings in a Wind.</p>

 <p>I arose, &#38; looking down saw at the bottom a heap of Stones-which had fallen abroad-and rendered the narrow Ledge on which they had been piled, doubly dangerous / at the bottom of the third Rock that I dropt from, I met a dead Sheep quite rotten-This heap of Stones, I guessed, &#38; have since found that I guessed aright, had been piled up by the Shepherd to enable him to climb up &#38; free the poor creature whom he had observed to be crag-fast-but seeing nothing but rock over rock, he had desisted &#38; gone for help-&#38; in the mean time the poor creature had fallen down &#38; killed itself.-As I was looking at these I glanced my eye to my left, &#38; observed that the Rock was rent from top to bottom-I measured the breadth of the Rent, and found that there was no danger of my being <i>wedged</i> in / so I put my Knap-sack round to my side, &#38; slipped down as between two walls, without any danger or difficulty-the next Drop brought me down on the Ridge called the <cdplace visited="Y">How</cdplace> / I hunted out my Besom Stick, which I had flung before me when I first came to the Rocks-and wisely gave over all thoughts of ascending <cdplace visited="N">Doe-Crag</cdplace>-for now the Clouds were again coming in most tumultously-so I began to descend / when I felt an odd sensation across my whole Breast-not pain nor itching-&#38; putting my hand on it I found it all bumpy-and on looking saw the whole of my Breast from my Neck <!--<ed_comment>[to my navel]. Words in brackets inked out in MS</ed_comment>-->-&#38; exactly all that my Kamell-hair Breast-shield covers, filled with great red heat-bumps, so thick that no hair could lie between them. They still remain / but are evidently less-&#38; I have no doubt will wholly disappear in a few Days. It was however a startling proof to me of the violent exertions which I had made.</p>

 <p>-I descended this low Hill which was all hollow beneath me-and was like the rough green Quilt of a Bed of waters-at length two streams burst out &#38; took their way down, one on <!--<ed_comment>[one]</ed_comment>--> side a high Ground upon this Ridge, the other on the other-I took that to my right (having on my left this high Ground, &#38; the other Stream, &#38; beyond that <cdplace visited="N">Doe-crag</cdplace>, on the other side of which is <cdplace visited="N">Esk Halse</cdplace>, where the head-spring of the <cdplace visited="N">Esk</cdplace><!--River Esk--> rises, &#38; running down the Hill &#38; in upon the Vale <!--<cdplace visited="N">Eskdale</cdplace>--> looks and actually deceived me, as a great Turnpike Road-in which, as in many other respects the Head of <cdplace visited="N">Eskdale</cdplace> much resembles <cdplace visited="N">Langdale</cdplace>) &#38; soon the channel sank all at once, at least 40 yards, &#38; formed a magnificent Waterfall -and close under this a succession of Waterfalls <!--Here, Coleridge describes the series of waterfalls directly above<cdplace visited="Y">Cam Spout</cdplace>--> 7 in number, the third of which is nearly as high as the first. When I had almost reached the bottom of the Hill, I stood so as to command the whole 8 Waterfalls, with the great triangle-Crag <!--??--> looking in above them, &#38; on the one side of them the enormous &#38; more than perpendicular Precipices &#38; <i><cdplace visited="N">Bull's Brows</cdplace></i> <!--East Butress of Sca Fell--> of <cdplace visited="N">Sca' Fell</cdplace>! And now the Thunder-Storm was coming on, again &#38; again!-Just at the bottom of the Hill I saw on before me in the Vale <!--<cdplace visited="N">Upper Eskdale</cdplace>-->, lying just under the River <!--<cdplace visited="N">River Esk</cdplace>--> on the side of a Hill <!--It is possible that, here, Coleridge refers to<cdplace visited="N">Cam Spout Crag</cdplace>-->, one, two, three, four Objects I could not distinguish whether Peat-hovels, or hovel-shaped Stones-I thought in my mind, that 3 of them would turn out to be stones-but that the fourth was certainly a Hovel. I went on toward them, crossing &#38; recrossing the Becks &#38; the River <!--<cdplace visited="Y">River Esk</cdplace>--> &#38; found that they were all huge Stones <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Sampson's Stones</cdplace>-->-the one nearest the Beck which I had determined to be really a Hovel, retained it's likeness when I was close beside / in size it it nearly equal to the famous <cdplace visited="N">Bowder stone</cdplace><!-- to be found in Borrowdale-->, but in every other respect greatly superior to it-it has a complete Roof, &#38; that perfectly <i>thatched</i> with weeds, &#38; Heath, &#38; Mountain-Ash Bushes-</p>

 <p>I now was obliged to ascend again, as the River<!--<cdplace visited="Y">River Esk</cdplace>--> ran greatly to the Left, &#38; the Vale <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Eskdale</cdplace>--> was nothing more than the Channel of the River<!--<cdplace visited="Y">River Esk</cdplace>-->, all the rest of the interspace between the mountains was a tossing up &#38; down of the Hills of all sizes-and the place at which I am now writing is called-<i>Te-as</i>, &#38; spelt, <i>Toes</i>-as the <cdplace visited="Y">Toes of Sca'Fell</cdplace>-. It is not possible that any name can be more descriptive of the Head of <cdplace visited="Y">Eskdale</cdplace>-I ascended close under <cdplace visited="N">Sca' Fell</cdplace>, &#38; came to a little village of Sheep-folds <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Upper Eskdale</cdplace>--> / there were 5 together / &#38; the redding Stuff, &#38; the Shears, &#38; an old Pot, was in the Passage of the first of them. Here I found an imperfect Shelter from a Thunder-shower-accompanied with such Echoes! O God! what thoughts were mine! O how I wishes for Health &#38; Strength that I might wander about for a Month together, in the stormiest month of the year, among these Places, so lonely &#38; savage &#38; full of sounds! </p>

<p><!--<ed_comment>Griggs notes that: 'This paragraph, which forms the conclusion of this letter in the Sara Hutchinson journal, has been transferred to keep the events of the tour in chronological order.'</ed_comment>-->After the Thunder-storm I shouted out all your names in the Sheep-fold-when Echo came upon Echo / and then <person met="N">Hartley</person> &#38; <person met="N">Derwent</person> &#38; then I laughed &#38; shouted <person met="N">Joanna</person> / It leaves all the Echoes I ever heard far behind, in number, distinctness &#38; <i>humanness</i> of Voice-&#38; then not to forget an old Friend I made them all say <person met="N">Dr. Dodd</person> <!--<ed_comment>'A reference to Dr. William Dodd, the forger.'</ed_comment>--> &#38;c.</p>

<p>After the Storm I passed on &#38; came to a great Peat-road, that wound down a hill, called <cdplace visited="Y">Maddock How</cdplace>, &#38; now came out upon the first cultivated Land which begins with a Bridge that goes over a Stream, a Waterfall of considerable height &#38; beautifully wooded above you, &#38; a great water-slope under you / the Gill down which it falls, is called <cdplace visited="Y">Scale Gill</cdplace>-&#38; the Fall <cdplace visited="Y">Scale Gill Force</cdplace>. (The word Scale &#38; Scales is common in this Country-&#38; is said by . . . <!--<ed_comment>'Name omitted in MS.'</ed_comment>--> to be derived from the Saxon Sceala; the wattling of Sheep-but judging from the places themselves, <i>Scale Force</i> &#38; this Scale Gill Force-I think it as probable that it is derived from Scalle-which signifies a deafening Noise.)

  <!--In his letter to Sara Hutchinson, dated 6 August 1802, there is no textual break between his account of 5 August and the morning of 6 August.-->

<p>This morning after breakfast I went out with him <!--<person met="Y">John Vicars Towers</person>-->, &#38; passed up the Vale <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Upper Eskdale</cdplace>--> again due East, along a higher Road <!--According to Molly Lefebure: 'This must mean the old peat-trod which runs from Gill Bank above Boot via Stony Tarn to Cam Spout and is gained by a zig-zag track from Taws.'-->, over a heathy upland, crossed the upper part of <cdplace visited="Y">Scale Gill</cdplace>, came out upon <cdplace visited="Y">Maddock How</cdplace>, &#38; then ascending turned directly Northward, into the Heart of the mountains; on my left the wild Crags under which flows the <cdplace visited="N">Scale Gill Beck</cdplace>, the most remarkable of them callled <cdplace visited="Y">Cat Crag</cdplace> (a wild Cat being killed there) &#38; on my right hand six great Crags, which appeared in the mist all in a file-and they were all, tho' of different sizes, yet the same shape all triangles-. Other Crags far above them, higher up the Vale <!--<cdplace visited="Y">Eskdale</cdplace>-->, appeared &#38; disappeared as the mists passed &#38; came / one with a waterfall, called <cdplace visited="N">Spout Crag</cdplace>-and another most tremendous one, called <cdplace visited="N">Earn Crag</cdplace><!--<ed_comment>[Heron Crag]</ed_comment>-->-I passed on, a little way, till I came close under a huge Crag, called <cdplace visited="N">Buck Crag</cdplace>-&#38; immediately under this is Four-foot Stone <!--Alan Hankinson indicates that 'Buck Crag' no longer appears on modern maps and identifies the stone as 'lying on the path beneath High Scarth Crag'-->-having on it the clear marks of four foot-steps. The Stone is in it's whole breadth just 36 inches, (I measured it exactly) but the part that contains the marks is raised above the other part, &#38; is just 20 and a half Inches. The first foot-mark is an Ox's foot-nothing can be conceived more exact-this is 5 and thee quarter Inches wide-the second is a Boy's shoe in the Snow, 9 and a half Inches in length <!--In his letter, Coleridge gives the measurements as numerical fractions rather than words--> / this too is the very Thing itself, the Heel, the bend the Foot, etc [check]-the third is the Foot-step to the very Life of a Mastiff Dog-and the fourth <i> is Derwent's very own first little Shoe</i>, 4 Inches in length &#38; o! it is the sweetest Baby shoe that ever was seen.-The wie-foot in <cdplace visited="N">Borrowdale</cdplace> is contemptible; but this really does work upon my imagination very powerfully / &#38; I will try to construct a Tale upon it / the place too is so very, very wild. I delighted the <person met="Y">Shepherd</person> by my admiration / &#38; the four foot Stone is my own Christening, &#38; <person met="Y">Towers</person> undertakes it shall hereafter go by that name for hitherto it has been nameless.-And so I returned &#38; have found a Pedlar here of an interesting Physiognomy-&#38; here I must leave off-for Dinner is ready-</p>
   
<p><!--Coleridge's letter to Sarah Hutchinson ends at this point, as he prepares for dinner with the Towers on the afternoon of 6 August 1802. Yet Coleridge continued to document his 'circumcursion' of the Lake District: an account which was made available through the twentieth-century textual scholarship of Kathleen Coburn. The following details of Coleridge's walking tour of the region are taken from volume one of 'The Notebooks of Samuel Taylor Coleridge'.-->Dined at <person met="Y">Towers'</person><!--<cdplace visited="Y">Taw House Farm</cdplace>-->-&#38; quitted him at half <!--again, Coleridge uses the fraction symbols--> past one. <cdplace visited="Y">Eskdale</cdplace>, more descriptively <cdplace visited="Y">Eskerdales</cdplace>, for it is a dale by the reluctant Mercy of the mountains, and the Hills, their children / some but Babes, others striplings, who stand breast-high to their Fathers-it is mainly however two Dales, like <cdplace visited="N">Stanley's in St Johns</cdplace> / only that the intervening ridge of Hills, is higher than those of <cdplace visited="N">Leathes' water</cdplace> &#38; lower than the <cdplace visited="N">Naddle Fell</cdplace>-The <cdplace visited="Y">Esk</cdplace><!--River Esk--> runs down the left hand of the ridge (as you go down)-both vales are in their course of very unequal breadths, often little more than the River Channel in the one, and as much space as would serve for the bed of a good river in the other/-Now then the Hill-ridge intermits and the vales become one / but never sure were lovelyer human Dwellings than these nested in Trees at the foot of the Fells, &#38; in among the intervening Hills / -After you have left <cdplace visited="N">Sca' Fell</cdplace> &#38; his Progeny behind you, the Fells on each side are low, rough, &#38; ragged with Bushwood, but low-</p>

<p>Inclosures made on the Screes partly for saving the Sheep from falling down, partly to reserve the Grass for the <i>Hogs</i></p>

<p>After the junction &#38; re-disjunction of the vales came to a Beck<!--This is probably<cdplace visited="Y">Whillan Beck</cdplace>-->, with a Bridge<!--<cdplace visited="Y">Beckfoot Bridge</cdplace>--> which I crossed-a pretty Beck with well wooded Banks, chiefly Oak, Ash, Alder, &#38; Birch, not without Thorns, Hazels, &#38; Hollies / 2 or 3 houses very pleasantly situated on the <cdplace visited="N">Esk</cdplace> side of the Bridge, &#38; on the other side a grand picture view of the Ridge &#38; Top of <cdplace visited="N">Sca Fell</cdplace> seen thro' a <!-- at this point in his notebook, Coleridge provides a line drawing to illustrate a V-shaped gap--> with a road at the bottom/.</p>

<p>This Beck (from <cdplace visited="N">Harter Fell</cdplace>?)<!--Coleridge is wrong in guessing that Whillan Beck runs down from Harter Fell. As he goes on to indicate, Whillan Beck runs down into Eskdale from Burnmoor Tarn.--> slants from the Bridge directly into the Esk, &#38; in a few hundred yards after, the vale narrows, unites, &#38; you walk by the side of the <cdplace visited="Y">Esk</cdplace>, now as broad as the <cdplace visited="N">Greta</cdplace> / the front side of the last Hill a pretty regular farmhouse with a noble <i>Back</i> of Wood / situated just as the House by the Brig at <cdplace visited="N">Great How</cdplace> / only the Hill is not as quarter as high / </p>

<p>I walk however not a furlong, before the <cdplace visited="Y">Esk</cdplace> slants away from me to the left again, but presents a beautiful reach / - <cdplace visited="N">Harter Fell</cdplace> is next to <cdplace visited="N">Lowfell</cdplace>, &#38; that Beck which I crossed the Bridge over, is <cdplace visited="Y">Whillah Beck</cdplace><!--Whillan Beck-->, comes from <cdplace visited="N">Burnmoor Tairn</cdplace> / on my right I have low Fells, <cdplace visited="N">Eskdale Moors</cdplace>, exceedingly rocky &#38; woody, huge perpend. smooth stones, now hidden, &#38; encircled by young wood, now starting out. The <i>regular House</i> is a shooting seat of <person met="N">Mr Stanley's</person> - I come again to a view of the river over some Hayfields and an Islet in the River <!--<cdplace visited="Y">River Esk</cdplace>--> / the opposite fells <cdplace visited="N">Birker Fells</cdplace>. - </p>

<!--It is difficult to organise Coleridge's Notebook by date at this stage of the text. His description of Coniston could refer to his topographical experiences of Saturday, 7 August; but, signficantly, he ends the following paragraph by indicating that he passes by 'Gateskarth, &#38; go for Skelleth [Skelwith]', which suggests that he is referring to his journey on foot from the village of Coniston to Brathay Hall at Clappersgate, near Ambleside. This journey took place on Sunday, 8 August, and Coleridge's precise route is uncertain. By this stage of his 'circumcursion', the topographical detail and accuracy of Coleridge's prose account becomes increasingly erratic and inconsistent. The possible reasons for this loss of precision need to be more explored in further detail; what is more, Coleridge's response to the environment needs to be contrasted with Wordsworth's comprehensive documentation and textual mapping of the Lake District landscape.-->

I have now <i>no clothes but what are patched at the elbows, &#38; knees, &#38; in the seat</i>-&#38; I am determined to wear them <i>out &#38; out</i>-&#38; to have none till after Christmas-<!--Coleridge ends the letter with references to his sons, Hartley and Derwent, and children in general.--></p>
